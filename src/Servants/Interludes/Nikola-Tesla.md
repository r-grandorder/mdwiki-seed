# Nikola Tesla

## Lightning

**Nikola Tesla:**
Originally&ndash;

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I would've loved to have seen it. The new world of humanity, guided by many different wisdoms.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
This new glimmer of land in the 21st century,
the dazzling new electrical civilization that I desired.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
When I was summoned, I was given much knowledge,
including knowledge of the 21st century!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Yes, I was overjoyed!
Overjoyed to see this shining new world!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But I was sorrowed!
I found the world had been scorched clean&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Um... I'm sorry, Mr. Tesla.
Is this going to go on for a while?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Where is the electricity? Where is the lightning of Zeus, the power I gave humanity?!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Ah, the closest civilization remaining as a Singularity to the 21st century is... I can't even believe this...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
&ndash;It's the 19th century that I know so well!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Furthermore, it's London!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
To think that it was that wicked summoning which led me to this location and era in an attempt to destroy it!

 
**Mash:**
Looks like he's still going.
Um, Mister, um... Can I say something?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Is this my punishment?
Oh god&ndash;

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
No, lightning which flashes at the end of the world!
Is this a new trial you have given me?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Oh lightning! Oh thunder! Oh great Benjamin Franklin, experimenter of lightning!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Please wrap up soon!
 
**Nikola:**
Hmm&ndash;?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mister Thunder!
 
**Nikola:**
No. If you're going to call me by a nickname,
yes, call me Doctor Lightning.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Doctor Lightning...
Doctor Lightning...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
T-That's... So cool! S-Somehow,
that makes my heart race! Doctor Lightning!

 
**Mash:**
Dr. Roman!?

 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hmm.
Of course, I'm grateful to you all, Master.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You're busy saving the world, and yet you're taking the time to accompany me on my walk.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I am truly grateful,
and I must respond in kind.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I almost aided in the incineration of this world,
but I will atone for my sin. Just leave it to me.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? Hmm?

 
**Mash:**
Mr. Nikola Tesla, is there a reason we're here?
The era is already restoring itself.

 
**Mash:**
(Earlier, well, I think he was just saying he wanted to visit the era closest to modern times...)

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Of course.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Do you remember what this place is,
Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's near the British Museum.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where are we?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Senpai. We're presently near the British Museum at the former entrance to the Mage's Association.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I'm going to save the world while I'm on my walk.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I am a Heroic Spirit of the Star, paving the way to a new era. My role is to do what the gods once did.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmph, that's a pretty bold statement.
It's true that Nikola Tesla is a powerful Heroic Spirit...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...and a rare hero with the Star Attribute.
He's even got the powerful skill "Pioneer of the Stars."

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But what does he mean?
Saving the world?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
The finishing touches.
This era has been restored&ndash;

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But something small remains.
If we ignore it, it could grow into great disaster.

 
**Mash:**
There's still something in this era&ndash;?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Watch. It'll arrive soon.

 
**???:**
&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
A magical energy signal!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's true! Ah, he was faster at finding it than me again!
Um, something's pouring in from the British Museum ruins!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This is an autonomous grimoire out of control!
How? The Demonic Fog is gone!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
An evil is awakening in the gap of the era as it is restored. That's all.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What is that?!

 
**Mash:**
No time to talk!
Senpai, incoming enemy!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Prepare for combat!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Roger, Master!
Moving to eliminate enemy!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Enemies destroyed.
Battle complete&ndash;

 
**???:**
&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
...Ugh!
There's still more!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Lightning flash!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Letting your guard down means death.
Remember that.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
That grimoire contains a great spell equal to the Presence Concealment skill.

 
**Mash:**
Thank you, Mister.
...I'll be more careful in the future.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Catch your breath.
The big one is coming.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He noticed it before me again&ndash;
He's right! A huge magical energy response is incoming!

 
**Mash:**
...I can feel it too.
A huge collection of magical energy, similar to a dragon!

 
**???:**
<span style="font-size:25px">GAAAAAH!</span>

 
**Dr. Roman:**
T-That response!
Is that a real demon or something&ndash;!?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahahaha!
No problem at all!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Mysteries of the old world! Hahaha!
No matter how vast, strong, or mighty you may be!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I am here! Pioneer of a new world,
my wisdom guiding the myths of humanity!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
In other words! Human Mythology,
Lightning and Thunder Descend&ndash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
T-The magical energy response...
has completely...vanished...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We beat it. Yup. Humans, I mean Heroic Spirits,
can do anything if they try.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
My observation records here can't tell for sure,
but if that was a True Demon...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...No, nope. Let's not say it!
Done talking about this!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A-Anyway! Even if we'd ignored it, maybe the era would've finished repairing first and we'd have been fine.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But we removed a dangerous possibility from the equation. Let's just be happy.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm glad.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. I agree, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thunder and Lightning is amazing.
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahaha. Of course. It's the source of human mythology, one that shall create a new era.

 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
All right,
I suppose that's enough for our walk.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Next, hmm&ndash;
I think I need to do more field work with this Rayshift.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What? You're doing more!?
N-No more demons, please!

 
**Fou:**
Foufou, Foou!


## Humanity's Mythology, Thunder and Lightning Descend

**Nikola Tesla:**
The AC/DC Debate!
Also known as the war of the currents!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You may think I'm just retreading the same ground as usual, but hear me out. Whatever you call it, this battle is the very essence of the eternal conflict between him and me!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Alternating current!?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Or direct current!?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Needless to say, as of the twenty-first century, civilization has proved beyond all doubt that alternating current is the superior technology...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...but in 1891, that mangy plebeian refused to see the truth. All he ever cared about was lining his own pockets.

 
**Helena:**
...Uh-huh. Go on.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Thus, I responded with my greatest feat of high-frequency, high-voltage engineering; the crystallization of all my hard work and accumulated wisdom to that date!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I speak, of course, of using my Tesla coils,
Tesla circuits, and hydraulic transformers...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...to conduct an electricity generation experiment at Niagara Falls in collaboration with the Westinghouse Company!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
And it worked brilliantly!

 
**Helena:**
Wow, that's amazing, Mr. Tesla. No wonder you were known as the modern-day god of thunder.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Ha ha ha, how very right you are, Madame Blavatsky. Indeed, while others have claimed such a title, I am the only one to make good on their promises!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Sir Benjamin Franklin may have proven that lightning could be tamed with his invention of the lightning rod, but I...went many steps further!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I accomplished the greatest feats of electricity humanity has ever seen! I am the true professor of thunder and lightning!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I am the one who relegated Zeus, Jupiter, Thor, Perkūnas, and countless other gods to relics of the past! I am the embodiment of the myth of humanity!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Indeed, three-phase alternating electrical current is the very hope of all humanity!

 
**Helena:**
...Uh-huh. I see.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You keep mentioning this myth of humanity, but you've never defined it.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What is this myth of humanity you keep bringing up, anyway?
 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Oh, hello, Master.
I didn't see you there.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Have you come to hear my regularly scheduled speech?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You do these regularly!?
 


---
 
**Helena:**
Hehe, I guess that's one way to put it. Every now and then, he just has to regale me with this stuff and get it out of his system.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahaha. While I usually pride myself on my composure, I must admit that even I cannot help but be embarrassed at hearing it put so plainly.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I must thank you for always indulging me in these self-redefinitions, Madame Blavatsky.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
My musings on who I was as a human, what I accomplished, and what remained out of my reach would not be the same were it not for your attentive audience.

 
**Helena:**
Oh, don't worry about me.
I always enjoy hearing you go on.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Well, thank you again. Truly.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Even if this is something of a well-rehearsed speech of mine, I still need to warm up the engine, so to speak.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Now then, Master, I believe you wished to know what I mean when I occasionally refer to the myth of humanity.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right. “Occasionally.”
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Yes.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'd say it's a little more frequent than that, but yeah.
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Haha, fair enough!

 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Well, it's really quite simple.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
The myth of humanity is just that,
a myth involving humanity.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It is a myth that follows mankind's footsteps towards the future in real time, rather than looking back to retrace the footsteps of old and irrelevant gods.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It is, in other words,
a wholly new myth for modern times.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did you talk about it when you were alive, too?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hmm. I don't remember reading about it in any of your biographies...
 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I may have discussed it when I was still alive, but I'm certain it would never have found its way into a book.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
After all, there were far too many experts in the world, mages included, for me to delve too deeply into myths of this nature.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
While I was indeed a poet, musician, and philosopher in addition to being a prodigious engineer, I was neither a mage nor a hermeneutician, so it didn't seem my place to pursue.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Though I would have liked to hear more from Paul Ricœur while I was still alive.

 
**Helena:**
Hmm. Sounds like you're not exactly obsessed with the idea then.

 
**Helena:**
Though there is that other thing you say not infrequently. You know, the one the heaven and earth Heroic Spirits aren't too fond of.

 
**Helena:**
What was it again?
“The present is theirs&ndash;”

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
“The future, for which I really worked, is mine.”

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahaha. True, but I certainly didn't mean it in that way.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
It's not that I have a grudge against individual gods or legendary heroes, after all.

 
**Helena:**
Could it be that you want to be a god yourself?

 
**Helena:**
You want to be the deity in charge of modern&ndash;or rather, electrical civilization?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Absolutely not!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
However, the idea that humanity as a whole could now be called a god is an interesting one.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Now that humans have acquired godly power in the form of electricity at their fingertips, they can and should use it to advance their entire civilization. Indeed, that very process is the World System!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sorry, World System?
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Oh, have you forgotten?
I could have sworn I talked about it before...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What was that again? Some kind of amazing energy system?
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Haha, it's the name of my system designed to completely control lightning; a system that can provide alternating current through the very skies!

 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Imagine a vast amount of energy, enough to reach every corner of the planet! A mechanism to supply electrical power wherever it is needed, forever freed from the constraints of wires!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
If the World System were to be successfully installed, covering the whole world, there would no longer be energy haves and have-nots.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
The blessings of electricity would be available equally to all, no matter where they may reside on the planet!

 
**Helena:**
See? He's really something, right? You can't get much more grandiose than something that affects the whole world!

 
**Helena:**
I really love it. It's all very Mahatma.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahahaha, feel free to shower me with even more praise, Madame Blavatsky. Ahh, it feels good to be appreciated!

 
**Helena:**
Though, you know...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hm?

 
**Helena:**
This World System of yours...

 
**Helena:**
It kind of sounds like the concept of mana, don't you think? You must've heard that before, no?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hmm, no, I can't say that I have.
And personally, I don't see it.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
In fact, while we're on the subject,
let's make this perfectly clear.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I don't care for things like mana or od one bit, my fair madam.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
The Age of Gods is over. True Ether is long since gone. Mankind has left Mystics far behind.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Myth and legends have both been relegated to the distant past, where they now hold no more sway than mere illusion.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
As humanity continued to further civilization and establish greater footholds into science, the old gods' bodies faded away, until they were no more than hazy Divine Spirits.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
In mage circles, it is said that while this world was once abundant in Mystics...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...it has since become a world abundant in civilization, where even those with no specialized knowledge can enjoy the benefits of technology and energy.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...But is that really true, my fair madam?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Even today, a vast supply of magical energy née mana remains manifest throughout the planet...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...and Mystics continue to engage in mysterious machinations, even reaching a point where the very world itself teeters on the brink of destruction.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Indeed, I perceive both the great undertaking that was the Incineration of Humanity and the bleached Earth disaster to be the inevitable endpoint of Mystics themselves.

 
**Helena:**
...
...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
However, my World System is completely, perfectly safe!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Indeed, I would go so far as to say it represents the Myth of Safety and the Advent of Lightnin&ndash;

 
**Edison:**
A fat lot of good that does now!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Edison!
 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
What do you want, Mr. Half-Witted Late-to-the-Party Eccentric!? Where does someone who arrives too late get off interrupting my moment of profound understanding with Madame Blavatsky and Master!?

 
**Edison:**
The only half-witted eccentric around here is you, you pompous fool! And what's this “Edison Arrives Too Late” nonsense?! How irritating!

 
**Edison:**
And if anyone's late to the party, it's you, if you're still spouting all that nonsense about a World System and standing waves!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Haven't you ever heard of the Schumann resonances, you mangy plebeian!? You haven't learned a thing since you died!

 
**Edison:**
Of course I know about Schumann and his resonances! And you're an even bigger fool than he was, since you couldn't even prove your theories when you were alive!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Huh?

 
**Edison:**
What?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Think about it. Schumann was essentially following in my footsteps, right?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
He would certainly never have arrived at the Schumann resonances had it not been for the critical insights he got from my World System.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
He may not have explicitly said so in his writings, but we all know it's true.

 
**Edison:**
...Do you even hear the words coming out of your mouth, you narcissistic self-proclaimed genius!? Your sheer arrogance is exactly&ndash;whaaarrrggghhh, my electricity is slipping out!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
What do you know? My electricity is slipping out too.

 
**Helena:**
Okay, that's enough!

 
**Edison:**
Aww...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
W-well, if you say so, Madame Blavatsky...

 
**Helena:**
Yes, I do. Both of you, keep your electricity where it belongs.

 
**Helena:**
I swear, just because you're essentially the modern-day thunder gods doesn't mean you have to always be spoiling for a fight like the old ones were.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
W-well, I know that was certainly the case for Thor, but I wouldn't say that was true of all the old thunder gods...

 
**Edison:**
What's this now, Tesla? Are you actually a secret admirer of thunder gods?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
What was that?

 
**Edison:**
Hm? Was that a mosquito landing on me? I didn't think there were any mosquitos in the Wandering Sea.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...There must be a draft in here. That almost tickled.

 
**Edison:**
...Almost tickled?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
A mosquito?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Both of you, cut it out!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Stop that! No instant rematches!
 


---
 
**Gentleman & Lion:**
...Hmph.

 
**Helena:**
All right, seriously, enough!
No more fighting, especially not in the library!

 
**Helena:**
Do you want me to call the librarian? You'll make Murasaki Shikibu cry if she sees you two fighting.

 
**Gentleman & Lion:**
No true gentleman would ever make a lady cry!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...Yes, you make a good point. This is a public institution, and just the sort of library we were hoping for at that.

 
**Edison:**
Indeed, you're exactly right, Madame Blavatsky.
As they say these days, this is not a good look.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Not only should we be more careful with our electricity, we should also take care not to have such shouted arguments.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
In fact, now that I think of it, my own impassioned speech earlier must have crossed the bounds of acceptable volume levels too!

 
**Helena:**
Hehe, no need to worry about that. I'd already cast a sound dampener spell before you got started.

 
**Helena:**
So you can talk as loudly as you like without worrying about bothering anyone else.

 
**Helena:**
But no more electricity, got it? The next time I see you two making sparks at each other, I'm blasting you with a spell of my own.

 
**Edison:**
Yes, madam.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
My apologies.

 
**Edison:**
Hmm... Tesla, what would you say to making a gentleman's agreement?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Oh? What did you have in mind?

 
**Edison:**
A moratorium on our AC/DC war while in the library. What do you think? It's a rather elegant suggestion, if I do say so myself.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hmm...

 
**Helena:**
(So all their fighting is actually a continuation of their AC/DC war, huh.)

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Very well. I certainly have no interest in continuing to fight a war I have already won.

 
**Edison:**
Oh?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
As alternating current has been conclusively proven the stuff of dreams, and direct current the stuff of nightmares...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...it would be the height of foolishness to continue debating it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, Tesla, what are you doing?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, okay, I think you've made your
 


---
 
**Edison:**
...
...

 
**Edison:**
...
...

 
**Edison:**
...Yes, you're right.
It WOULD be the height of foolishness.

 
**Edison:**
The sheer folly required to pursue a pipe dream as preposterous as the World System even after one's death, well...

 
**Edison:**
It's so absurdly idiotic all one can do in response is laugh.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Now don't you start too!
 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I'll pipe YOUR dreams, you mangy plebeian!

 
**Edison:**
So you've shown your true colors, you half-witted eccentric! You obviously never had any intention of agreeing to a truce!

 
**Edison:**
I see now I have no choice but to halt your idiotic aspirations in their tracks myself!

 
**Edison:**
As the king of inventors, it's my job to put runaway electricians like you in their place!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Do your worst!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hahahahaha, now that's more like it! I can't even remember the last time I fought you in this Spirit Origin!

 
**Helena:**
Gaaah, forget it! I give up!

 
**Helena:**
Master, I'm going to put a Bounded Field up around them so they don't destroy the library. Once that's done, try and figure out a way to stop them!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
G-got it!
 
**Helena:**
Great!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's a lot of pressure!
 
**Helena:**
Don't worry! I know you can handle it!

 


---
 
**Edison:**
Graaaaaah! Let the two-hundred and thirty-sixth AC/DC war begin! Come forth, my mechanized infantry!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's brought out that many!?
 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Are you really summoning your underlings from a separate Singularity here to help you, you cheating bastard!?

 
**Edison:**
What's wrong with that, you vapid pretty boy inventor!? I'm practically a Singularity-based Heroic Spirit already! Why else would I, the devastatingly handsome king of inventors, have the head of a lion?

 
**Edison:**
That is, of course, not to say that it is not an exceptionally stylish visage to present to the world!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Shut up!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...This did escalate rather quickly, didn't it. Master, I'm sorry to ask this of you, but would you mind helping me?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
I could easily handle the fleabag, but dealing with that many mechanized infantry at the same time is another story.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess you have a point.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Okay, but you owe me one!
 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Much appreciated!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
All right...let's remind this mangy plebeian just how powerful three-phase alternating electrical current truly is!

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...
...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...Um, excuse me, everyone?
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
...I was in the archives, but when I heard what sounded like explosions, I had to come see what was happening!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
C-can someone please explain to me what happened here?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
How did all those steel mannequins end up scattered across the floor?

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
And why are Lord Nikola Tesla and Lord Edison sprawled out alongside them?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
(Huff... Gasp...)

 
**Edison:**
M-my magical energy is completely spent.
I can't even move anymore...

 
**Helena:**
I'm so sorry about the disturbance, Murasaki Shikibu. We couldn't get these two blockheads to stop fighting, no matter how hard we tried!

 
**Helena:**
I did my best to ensure they didn't damage the library, but in case they did...

 
**Helena:**
...please feel free to bill all three of us for the charges.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I, uh, I see. Thank you for the offer, but that won't be necessary. The library is perfectly fine.

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I'm more concerned with whether Lords Tesla and Edison are okay.

 
**Helena:**
Oh sure, you don't have to worry about them!
They'll be fit as a fiddle again in no time!

 
**Helena:**
...You know, now that I think about it, they never went all out like this at Chaldea that often.

 
**Helena:**
I'm sure they had plenty of pent-up frustration, so this should help get that out of their systems for a while.

 
**Helena:**
I'd say this should keep them settled down for at least six months or so!

 
**Murasaki Shikibu:**
I see. So that's how this works...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, that tracks.
 
**Helena:**
Y-you can tell too, huh?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Good to know.
 
**Helena:**
I don't really get it myself, but that just seems to be the way young men&ndash;no, these two whelps operate.

 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...There, completely unharmed.
I do apologize to all three of you for the trouble.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
As a gentleman, it pains me deeply to think I may have caused you lovely ladies in particular any degree of distress.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Please, don't worry about the lion-head. I'll lock him u&ndash;that is to say, put him in the simulator myself.

 
**Edison:**
Not if I put you there first,
you pathetic wrestler reject.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Oh, if it isn't the pitiful wrestler wannabe in spandex. I didn't know you were still alive.

 
**Edison:**
You bet I am. ...I can't go back to the Throne until I've at least seen your research papers.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Huh?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
What did you just say?

 
**Edison:**
You said something about a true World System earlier, yes? Well, I don't know anything about that, seeing as you never formally announced it.

 
**Edison:**
So I decided to refrain from declaring it a failure until I at least read your presentation.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Are you serious, Edison?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You aren't going to try to get in my way?

 
**Edison:**
I don't have a company to manage or employees to provide for here. Right now, I'm only a scientist, just like any other.

 
**Edison:**
So I figured I could deign to interact with you as a fellow scientist, rather than a company owner.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You guys...
 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
......

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...You expect me to believe that?

 
**Edison:**
How dare you!?
