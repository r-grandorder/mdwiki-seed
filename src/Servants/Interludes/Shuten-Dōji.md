# Shuten Douji

## Drunkenness, Madness, and Rage

**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh my. Perfect timing!
Come over here, closer, if you would.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I was just about to look for treats to go along with my drink. Come, sit next to me. Oh don't worry, I won't bite.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sure, I guess.
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Yes, yes. It's good to be honest.
What a good child you are.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Don't be afraid, you can sit closer to me.
...Oh fine, I will sit closer myself, fufufu.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...This is my room though.
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Come on, don't worry about the details.
We have a close relationship, right?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What was it called?
Master and Servant?

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, right. Is the girl with the glasses not with you?
She's always hanging around you...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I thought she might be your lover,
but I guess I was wrong.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Well, it doesn't really matter, does it?
Here, have a drink first.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm not old enough to drink.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Water's fine.
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh my, oh my.
You're no fun.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
The world's full of men who'd love nothing more than for me to pour them a drink.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Are you still afraid of me?
That hurts my maidenly heart.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maidenly...heart?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
But those horns...
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I'm sorry, my tongue slipped.
I should really be mindful of what I say, no?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...But you know, isn't it a bit dull around here? We can't even go outside to gaze upon the moon, it seems.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
All I'm good for is drinking and appreciating flowers.
You understand why I'd visit you, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You like flowers?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Well, my favorite thing is alcohol, followed by flowers, then pretty young men&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I don't have a fourth favorite, and fifth is the moon,
I suppose. I like things that please me, and pretty things.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's very elegant.
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, how kind.
But it's not like that.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I don't read poems or write love letters, and being all formal in a palace is just so bothersome.

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Hmm? What's wrong? What's with that look?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
The oni of Mt. Ooe aren't really that special.
I'm just a girl who likes to drink.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I do eat people, I suppose, but I'm not as violent as Ura or Ootakemaru.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Well, an oni is an oni. I suppose we're not so different in the eyes of humans.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What exactly did you do before?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hmm&mdash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What kind of oni were you?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufufufufu. You're going to ask?
Don't blame me if you regret it.

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Very well, it's nothing I have to hide.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I suppose, for someone like you, I could tell a couple stories.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Where should I begin...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Can I talk about after I returned to Japan?
My memories before that are fuzzy.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Before returning?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To Japan?
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, you didn't know?
Long ago I lived on the continent&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Speaking of which, I don't think I've told anyone about that. No wonder it didn't get passed down.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Well, it doesn't matter. Anyway, some things happened and I came back to Japan.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I wandered around Kyoto, around the rivers.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And the next thing I knew I was drinking in a marvelous palace on Mt. Ooe.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You see, it was Ibaraki... Ibaraki-Douji.
She was considerate and showed me to the oni lair.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oni were probably the ones who built that palace.
It was quite a sight, up on that mountain.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
After that, I had such a wonderful time.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I drank whenever I desired, and I loved whatever I desired.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I ventured to Kyoto whenever I felt like it, and killed, ate, and plundered, as I pleased.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I took what I liked back to the mountain.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Flowers, the moon, handsome men, pretty women, rare jewels, fabrics, pots... I loved all of them.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...You killed people?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Here and there.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...It sounds like you had fun.
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Of course I did.
I'm an oni.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I rampage, love, laugh to my heart's content without a shred of worry or doubt.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That's what I am, an oni.
Humans like that kind of stuff too, right?

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It was so much fun, but it didn't last long.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
The nobles and onmyouji of Kyoto got very mad.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
They sent the famous Minamoto-no-Raikou, the next head of the Minamoto clan, and Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings after me&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
&mdash;Ah yes, that was a terribly amusing night.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I'd been after him for a while. That boy with blonde hair and blue eyes... And then he came for me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sakata Kintoki?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Yes, that's right. Him.
The one they called Kintoki.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It's strange, isn't it? He moved up in the world after he became famous through stories. As if he was a Shogi piece.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Golden?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Right. What's with that? He was a cute kid, and now he's even cuter, you know?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
In life he was reviled for his blonde hair.
Here people just think he's a fan of Western culture.

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Hahh. When I look at his body, I remember.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
If I'd pulled it off that night, I could've put the Red Dragon's ulna in my wine.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
What would it have tasted like, I wonder?
I'd love to drink it.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But that night, they beat me.
They won the fight and killed me.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
They gave me poisoned wine&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And well, I got drunk, and that was it.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
The divine poisoned wine, Shinpen Kidoku! With an excellent wine like that, of course I'd get drunk!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...They attacked while you slept, huh?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Indeed. I was having a nice nap, and off went my head.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I still remember his face when he did it.
He looked like he couldn't bear with it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Does it still bother you?
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Huh?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Not really? I'm mostly impressed they managed to do it.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I killed and ate humans.
It's natural that I'd be killed in turn.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I may be a little ditzy, but I don't forget when I've embarrassed myself.

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
&mdash;Oh, but... I wish I could've seen those blue eyes once more.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like you're daydreaming now.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did you love him?
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh, my. Are you saying that because...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You're jealous when I speak of another man?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufufufufu. Instead of fearing the oni of Mt. Ooe, you're getting jealous. You've got guts. I'm impressed.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...Come, move closer. Why don't I take this chance to teach you a few things?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Teach me?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What?
 


---
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey, how's the training coming, Boss?
I take it everything is going well? I'll tag along&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Oh my. Speak of the devil, huh?
What a coincidence.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Sorry, Boss. Gotta run!
Just remembered I didn't eat breakfast!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Wait just a minute.
You're making it a little too obvious.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hey, don't grab my collar!
I'm not a cat! You'll wrinkle it!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You're not a cat, you're a tiger.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You think you can just come in here when I'm in the mood, and then ignore me and leave?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I-I don't know what you're in the mood for, but it takes too much energy to deal with you this early!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You're still as naive as ever.
All right, I have an idea.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
The perfect way to liven up my drinking&mdash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
...There's a good way for the three of us to all work up a sweat together. How about it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Work up a sweat?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Together?
 


---
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Are you stupid!? If you want to do stuff like that, you need to... um... yeah...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Do stuff! You know!
Like it's gotta be at night, right?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Right, right. Look into my eyes and say that.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I am! You just can't tell because of my shades!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Tch. I mean for one thing, you shouldn't just strut around with such revealing&ndash;

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Yoink.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Waah!?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Quiet.
Okay, let's go.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Senpai?
And Shuten and Kintoki?

 
**Mash:**
What's wrong?
Kintoki looks really upset...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Shuten-Douji is...
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Shuten-Douji is what?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, perfect timing.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. If it's perfect timing for you, it's perfect for me, too.

 
**Mash:**
I mean, um, what are you doing in the Command Room? We're adjusting the equipment...

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You've got that thing. The see-mu-lay-tor, was it?
We're borrowing it for a bit.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm? You want to use the combat simulator? We can't Rayshift because we're still adjusting the equipment, but that should be fine.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Seeing you together had me worried for a bit, but you're not fighting, are you?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
We're not fighting, but&mdash; Wait!
Is that what you meant by working up a sweat?

 
**Mash:**
Working up a sweat?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hahahaha. What did you think I meant?
You were talking about training, so I agreed to help.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And I really am feeling in the mood.
I need to smash some things to calm down.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Will you come with me?
You, Master, and Mash, too.

 
**Mash:**
If Senpai wants me...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess I have no choice.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Morning workout time!
 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That's right. That's what I want to hear.
You really are my type.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Come, child. Let's work hard.
As hard as you possibly can.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
&mdash;Be ready to kill, please.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
It's been so long since we've met. I want you and me to be more... more, more, more, more...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Covered in sweat... and covered in blood...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Until you can't tell flesh and bone apart...
Come at me at full strength...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I want a deathmatch in that ephemeral world.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Sheesh. You really have a frightening mind.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
You're a Servant, at least in theory.
I thought you'd turned into something more ladylike...

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
But I guess I didn't need to worry!
Okay, time to snap off your horns and make you cry!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hahaha. Splendid, splendid.
Come join us, Master.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Regardless of how he looks, he's as tough as a bear. Let's fight him, hand in hand!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Didn't think I'd see you fight next to a human!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Wait, are you really drunk?
Maybe seeing doubles or triples of me?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Fine. Come and get me!
I'll give you a golden wake-up call!

 
**Mash:**
(Wait, we're helping her, huh?
No, if you're fighting, so am I!)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's keep this from getting out of hand.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's try not to die.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
(Right, Master!)

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You've got guts. Nothing less from the hunk I had my eyes on.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I think this'll be fun.
Doctor, lend me your ear.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
(Psst... You can do this, right? I know you can.
I've heard you're VERY talented.)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Your breathiness, your words, the way you move, it's all really sexy!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I guess I can't help it if I'm giving in to your temptations!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, leave it to me! You want mass-produced Kintokis, you got 'em!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Huh!? What are you talking about?
Hey, that ain't fair, Shuten!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Thank you so much☆
I'll pay you back later with a drink, okay?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Now&mdash; Let the party begin! Be consumed by drunkenness, madness, and excitement! Everything starts after that!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Sakata Kintoki:**
Damn! You're tiny but you hit hard!
I guess you haven't forgotten a thing, huh?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Of course not! I'm an oni to my core.
Do you think I'd fight a war I couldn't win?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You're still as strong as I remember, though...
If I let my guard down you'll split me right into two...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
That makes me happy.
You're hitting me with your real strength.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But... This isn't enough for me.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Let's stop fighting like little kids. I want you to come at me in a way that's more...grown-up.

 
**Mash:**
(Huh!?)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Kintoki's pretty strong already.
 
**Mash:**
(Y-Yeah... He seems fiercer than usual today.)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I see a second fight coming.
 
**Mash:**
(Yes. I can't see this just ending.
There'll probably be at least one more fight.)

 


---
 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...You really haven't changed, have ya?
No matter how much time passes, you're still the same.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I'm a classic, not some passing fad.
And as for you...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Your appearance has changed, but your heart hasn't. You're still the little kid you used to be.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You're holding back. Is it because you're that afraid to hit a woman?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I don't mind. Be fiercer. More violent.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
If you want more of a fight, let's bring out the bears!

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
BEARS!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Right, right. Bears. Hmm...
Yeah, I've got bears.

 
**Mash:**
(He's got bears!?)

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Let's get back to it.
I'll melt both you and the bears.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
But don't worry. I'll lap up all your blood before it touches the ground.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Hah, I'm not so out of it that I'll let you eat me! I'll take your head, and use my own blood as lipstick on it!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Ahahahaha! I like that!
It sounds so elegant!

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
To have you put funeral makeup on me would be so wonderful and I bet that idiot Raikou would grow horns from hearing it!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...Simulation complete. Both have only suffered minor damage to their Spirit Cores.

 
**Mash:**
Also, um... Those were soul eaters.
Not bears.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It said they were bears.
 
**Mash:**
The Doctor was being silly.
Doctor, I don't think that's a good idea.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sorry, I was getting too into it... But I think it was the only way to calm down Shuten-Douji.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She may look refined, but she's the most brutal oni of them all.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She might've attacked Fujimaru if she got bored.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm just glad everyone's alive.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, you're right. Both of them were extremely agitated...

 
**Mash:**
But I'm glad we made it back safe.
Good work, Senpai.

 


---
 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufu, that was fun.
Thank you both, Mash, Master.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
You played along with my little game.
Such good, good children you are. Lovely.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
And you too, of course, sweaty little boy.
That was quite the invective for being impromptu.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
I bet you could've taught those nobles in Kyoto a thing or two about plays.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
I'm never reading poems or haikus again.
Bikes are the big thing now.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...Sigh. Damn it, I got all worked up. You look unconcerned as ever... You were just toying with me, huh?

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
How much of what you say is just an act?
Crap, I'm so tired...

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufufufufufu. How much is an act?

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Of course, I'm always serious.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
...R-Right.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fufufu. You're still a kid. Even though you're SUCH a big and handsome man.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Fighting for your life while drunk, outwitting your opponent while pressing your body against theirs...
Now that's amusing.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
&mdash;Don't you think so, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
R-Right.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-I didn't think you'd ask me.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai is panicking!
Hang in there!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Wow. In the face of a drunk Shuten-Douji, Heroic Spirits and their Master are all nothing but playthings.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not sure if that's just how oni are, or just how she is, though.

 
**Mash:**
...Yeah. I-I'll do my best, too...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
Actually, let's just get back to work. Yeah.

 
**Shuten-Douji:**
Hehehe. Hang in there, kid.

 
**Sakata Kintoki:**
Grrr!

 
**Mash:**
...Playthings...


## So I'll Remain Myself Whether I'm Drunk, Crazed, or Seething and Sneering
