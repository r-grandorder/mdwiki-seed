# Mysterious Heroine X

## Saber Slayer, Chapter Dawn

**Mash:**
The Saber of Sabers?

 
**X:**
Right. The best, strongest, and greatest of all Sabers...
That's...

 
**X:**
THE SABER OF SABERS!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
And there's a tournament to decide who gets the title...? Really?

 
**X:**
It's true. Why?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(No, "Are you really the King of the Holy Sword?" was what I wanted to ask...)

 
**X:**
Anyways, it's the ultimate festival where Sabers gather from all over the world. I can't stand it!

 
**X:**
Why didn't I get an invitation?
I am the greatest of all Sabers!

 
**X:**
They should be sending an invitation to me in due solemnity, carefully packed with sweets! Or bacon, ham, and sausage!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Y-Yeah, they should...
 
**Mash:**
Nobody can stop Heroine X when she gets like this...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're, um...an Assassin.
 
**X:**
There you go again, Master...
I am CLEARLY a Saber.

 


---
 
**X:**
Anyway, I will not allow any tournament that refuses to admit me happen.

 
**X:**
I need to get in there and show them what a real Saber looks like! So let's go bust some heads!

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Announcer:**
The tournament keeps heating up! Challengers for the third round... Enter the arena!

 
**Announcer:**
She's great at staying home while everyone's out! She can handle (rebellion) by herself!

 
**Announcer:**
It's Mordred, the Treacherous Knight!

 
**Mordred:**
So you're my next opponent, huh... Hmm?
Have I seen you somewhere before?

 
**X:**
... (Sweatdrop)

 
**Announcer:**
Identity unknown! Origin unknown!
"I am THE Saber of Sabers!"

 
**Announcer:**
By the way, you're not a Saber, are you?
It's Mysterious Heroine X, AKA 
 
**Announcer:**
MYSTERIOUS HEROINE X!!

 
**Mash:**
A redundant introduction...

 
**Mordred:**
Wait, is that you, Father? It IS you!
What are you doing with that weird hat?

 
**X:**
I don't know whose child you are, but I'm fighting for the world and for Sabers!

 
**X:**
It's time for you to die with a hole in your stomach!!

 
**Mordred:**
Why!?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mordred:**
This sword style... So you ARE Fath&ndash;

 
**X:**
Secret technique: NO COMMENT!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mordred:**
This lack of mercy... You really must be...
F-Father...

 
**X:**
YOU'RE-OUT-OF-THE-WILL-CALIBUR!

 
**Mordred:**
Whaaaaaat!?
Father, you jerk!

 
**X:**
An easy victory!

 
**X:**
England's crisis has been averted,
and another Saber who isn't me has disappeared.

 
**Mash:**
Um, perhaps you've met your opponent before somewhere...

 
**X:**
Nope! Definitely not! Never seen 'em!
DEFINITELY not a member of my family!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
W-What is going on?

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...


## Saber Slayer, Chapter Battle

**X:**
Ages have passed since the last match, and I've Caliburn'd down countless Sabers.

 
**X:**
At last, the time has come!

 
**Mash:**
The time has come, huh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash?
 
**Mash:**
I-I'm fine, Senpai!

 
I'm just a little tired...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Have you stopped caring?
 
**Mash:**
N-No, definitely not, Senpai!

 
I'm just a little tired...

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm not sure why, but I think Mash is starting to feel a little under the weather.

 
**Fou:**
Foouu...

 
**Announcer:**
Competitors for the next match, enter!
On the east side, a competitor from the Far East...

 
**Announcer:**
...defeating countless Sabers with overwhelming power, it's Mysterious Heroine X... AKA 
 
**Announcer:**
MYSTERIOUS HEROINE X!

 
**Mash:**
I'm telling you, that's redundant.

 
**Announcer:**
And on the west side, from Rome...comes a lady who's taken time away from running the country!

 
**Announcer:**
We the people have been waiting for you!
The Emperor of Rose, blooming in Eternal Rome!

 
**Announcer:**
HER MAJESTY NERO CLAUDIUS!

 
**Nero:**
I thank you all for coming!
I am the Fifth Emperor of the great Roman Empire...

 
**Nero:**
Nero Claudius!

 
**Mash:**
N-Nero's really popular, huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, this is her home...

 
**X:**
Tch... If this was held in Britain, I know for a fact I'd be getting more cheers!

 
**Nero:**
Umu, umu! An emperor must live up to the expectations of the people! Now how about a pre-match song!?

 
**X:**
Your days of wickedness are at an end, tyrant Nero...
Or should I say...

 
**X:**
RED SABER!

 
**Nero:**
What!? Y-You're...

 
**X:**
Heh... Don't tell me you've forgotten this face.
You're finished at last, Red Saber.

 
**X:**
Sabers are supposed to be BLUE, you hear me?
Black and white are not to be allowed either.

 
**X:**
Well, personally I didn't mind that color lineup, but red is OUT! NO MORE RED!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, she didn't mind it, huh?

 
**X:**
I never gave permission for Sabers to be split into blue and red, anyway!

 
**X:**
Then you come along, posing as this heinous, super-popular Emperor everyone loves...

 
**X:**
I'm THROUGH letting you get away with your bluffing!

 
**Nero:**
Y-You...

 
**X:**
It's too late to beg for your life...

 
**Nero:**
By the way, who are you?

 
**X:**
DIIIEEEEE!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nero:**
Tch, I don't know who you are, but you're good!
E-Even I am surprised at how good you are, but I'll act tough anyway!

 
**X:**
Heh... I truly am the strongest Saber.
If you're willing to apologize and throw me a feast...

 
**X:**
I just might forgive you.

 
**Nero:**
But I cannot lose! Everyone!
Give me your power to protect Rome from this invader!

 
**X:**
Historically, you're the invader!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Nero:**
I-I can't believe you won...
Such obsession, and such bizarre, inexplicable power...

 
**Nero:**
Gasp! I remember you!
How could I have forgotten?

 
**X:**
You finally remembered? But it's too late n&ndash;

 
**Nero:**
You're Jeanne! You're Jeanne d'Arc,
the girl with the amazing, voluptuous breasts!

 
**X:**
THAT'S-DEFAMATION-CALIBUR!

 
**X:**
I did it, Master!
I defeated another Saber!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? No, um... Yeah.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
K-Keep it up.
 


---
 
**X:**
Right! Leave it to me!
I will beat all the other Sabers!

 
**Mash:**
S-Senpai...
Shouldn't you stop her soon?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
How long are we going to be doing this?

 
**Fou:**
Foou...


## Saber Slayer, Chapter Awaken

**Announcer:**
It's time for the much anticipated final round! The last battle to decide who the Saber of Sabers will be!

 
**Announcer:**
It'll be held here, in the northern lands of Britain,
in this mysterious castle with a long, storied history!

 
**Mash:**
It's storied but mysterious, huh...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So we moved locations.
 
**X:**
It makes sense to hold the last battle in Britain, a sacred place for Sabers.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's good that it has a history.
 
**Mash:**
Now Senpai's stopped caring too...

 


---
 
**Announcer:**
Now... ENTER THE ARENA!
At last it's time!

 
**Announcer:**
A Saber whose affiliation, age, blood-type, and birthday, are all a mystery! Mysterious Heroine X, AKA...

 
**Announcer:**
MYSTERIOUS HEROINE XXXXXXXXX!

 
**Mash:**
Again with the redundancy... Oh, forget it.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Mash is completely done with this, huh?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fooou.

 
**Announcer:**
And sitting on her throne is the legendary,
ultimate blue Saber...

 
**Announcer:**
ABSOLUTE MONARCH ALTRIAAAAAAA!

 
**Altria:**
Um, excuse me... No one actually told me why I'm here.
What is this, exactly?

 
**X:**
At last the day has come...
She and I are two sides of a coin... Light and shadow...

 
**X:**
But I cannot become the true Saber,
unless I can overcome her!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No, you're both the same Saber, so... Huh?
 
**Mash:**
Senpai... Let's just not think about it too hard...
My head is really starting to hurt.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go, Blue Sab I mean, Mysterious Heroine X!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai... W-Well, if this is the last fight,
I think I can get through this...

 


---
 
**X:**
I am the greatest, strongest, and ultimate Saber...
Mysterious Heroine X!

 
**X:**
I'm worried about parallel worlds and causality and stuff causing a space-time collapse, but here I go!

 
**Altria:**
Ugh!? Why do I feel like I'm staring at my own dark side?

 
**Altria:**
I can't let this Saber out into the world...
I don't know why, but for my own sake as well as others!

 
**X:**
Now let us battle for the title of true Saber!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Altria:**
W-What a dark aura...
What is it that drives you?

 
**X:**
You wouldn't understand...
The terror of having more faces like you showing up!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
No, I think she totally understands...

 
**Altria:**
I have this feeling that if I don't put an end to you, my reputation will be in danger!

 
**Altria:**
Stars, lend your power to my holy sword!
The power to beat that bad, weird me!

 
**X:**
My Holy Sword, destroy all Sabers!
This is a battle I cannot lose!

 
**Mash:**
T-This is completely out of control!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Altria:**
I-Impossible... I have the home field advantage...
I even have max bonus for being famous...(Ka-Thud)

 
**X:**
...I-I won! I won, Master!
At last, at last I'm...

 
**X:**
THE SABER OF SABERS!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Congrats, Sab&ndash; I mean Heroine X!
 
**X:**
Thank you, Master! Now I don't have to sob into my pillow at night in fear of unknown Sabers anymore!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You say something too, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
Huh? M-Me?

 
**Mash:**
Congratulations, Alt&ndash;
I mean Mysterious Heroine X!

 


---
 
**X:**
At last, all Sabers have been destroyed! As the ultimate Saber, I can advance on wonderfully and invincibly...

 
**X:**
...through a Holy Grail War just for Sabers...
The true Holy Grail War begins!

 
**Lots of Sabers:**
Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations!

 
**X:**
Thank you, everyone!
Thank you, everyone!

 
**X:**
I have surpassed all Sabers to become the ultimate Saber. I am now...

 
**X:**
THE SABER OF SABERS!

 
**???:**
...er, ...ber... Wait, I mean Mysterious Heroine X!

 
**X:**
By the way, I don't think you noticed,
but I'm actually King Ar&ndash; Huh!?

 
**Mash:**
We're having udon noodles for dinner.
It's time to get up.

 
**X:**
T-This... This can't be...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Were you asleep?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You don't want udon?
 


---
 
**X:**
The old "it was all a dream" ending?
Who does that anymore!?

 
**Fou:**
FOOOOU!
