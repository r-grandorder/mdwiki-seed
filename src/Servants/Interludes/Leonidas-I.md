# Leonidas I

## Leonidas Boot Camp

**Leonidas:**
Master!
I know it's sudden, but let's train.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Why?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
For what...
 


---
 
**Leonidas:**
You're a mage. So perhaps you think physical strengthening is unnecessary.

 
**Leonidas:**
However, such notions may prove to be fatal.

 
**Leonidas:**
As the battles get fiercer and deadlier, it's essential to fortify your body.

 
**Leonidas:**
You must improve your strength and endurance!
Relax, my calculations are flawless!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I feel even more nervous now...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm not so sure about that...
 


---
 
**Leonidas:**
Yes, just leave everything to me!
Come on, let's be off.

 
**Mash:**
We have arrived.

 
**Mash:**
This is a mock battlefield.
Um...Senpai, are you sure about this?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 


---
 
**Leonidas:**
As long as I, Leonidas, am by your side, there's nothing to fear!

 
**Leonidas:**
Let's start training!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Leonidas:**
You're working up a good sweat, I see.
Let's continue!

 
**Mash:**
OK.
I will summon your next opponent.

 
**Leonidas:**
Bring it on!

 
**Mash:**
Hmm, something's not right.Let's see&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Wh-What's going on&ndash;?

 
**Leonidas:**
Ah.
Rejoice, Master!

 
**Leonidas:**
It seems like our latest arrival is literally brimming with muscles!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm supposed to be happy about that?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's nothing to "rejoice" about!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Th-There's been a malfunction!

 
**Mash:**
We seem to have accidentally summoned something that we shouldn't have!

 
**Mash:**
Master, retreat immediately!

 
**Leonidas:**
What a silly suggestion!
This is the perfect chance!

 
**Leonidas:**
Come on, Master...let's muscle through this!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Leonidas:**
Ah, what a fine battle!

 
**Mash:**
All adjustments complete.
The final enemy has been set.

 
**Mash:**
What do you want to do?

 
**Mash:**
I think it's fair to conclude that training is over for today...

 
**Leonidas:**
Not yet! We must follow this through to the end.
On to the next enemy!

 
**Mash:**
Understood.
The final opponent is a random enemy.

 
**Leonidas:**
...Um, Miss Mash.
Just what is that, exactly?

 
**Leonidas:**
Is it that, uh, you know.
I think it starts with a "G."

 
**Mash:**
Yes, it's a Ghost-type enemy.

 
**Leonidas:**
...Ghost...collective consciousness...science!

 
**Mash:**
Leonidas?
You seem to be sweating quite a lot...

 
**Leonidas:**
What? No, not at all!
I'm doing fine here. Just fine.

 
**Leonidas:**
You might not think so, but I once took on 100,000 men!
A mere spirit devoid of muscles is nothing to fear&ndash;

 
**Leonidas:**
I apologize, Master! I confess I don't know how to deal with ghosts!

 
**Leonidas:**
You see, my muscles are useless against them&ndash;!
They seem smarter than me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's overcome it.
 
**Leonidas:**
Overcome it
...you say?

 
**Leonidas:**
U-Uh, I suppose it's not hard to say we won't run into ghost again in the future.

 
**Leonidas:**
Thus, I must stand my ground!
Fear not, Leonidas!

 
**Leonidas:**
This enemy's nothing compared to a Persian army of 100,000 men!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't worry. Your attacks will work.
 
**Leonidas:**
What!
...I see, you may be right.

 
**Leonidas:**
Indeed, even these ghosts were once human!
Thus, my muscles are not useless after all!

 


---
 
**Leonidas:**
Very well, Master!
Let us face this ghost!

 
**Leonidas:**
Raaaaargh!
We are ghost hunters!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Leonidas:**
Huff, huff, huff...

 
**Leonidas:**
What a powerful enemy...Contact with a ghost chills you to the bone. I just learned something...

 
**Leonidas:**
Thank you, Master!
I was able to overcome the ghost with your help.

 
**Leonidas:**
I swear to safeguard you from all enemies, to stave off despair, and to always bring you victory!
