# Robin Hood

## Hunter of the Forest

**Mash:**
Oh? Robin's buying things from that shop.
Did you tell him to do that?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, I asked him to guard the area.
 
**Mash:**
As expected, Senpai knows exactly what to do with Servants. If there's nothing to do, have them patrol.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I don't remember asking him anything...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Then he's just walking around on his own?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, until they're needed they're free to do what they want, but...

**Robin Hood:**
Those beat up old blades? If you're just gonna give them to the blacksmith I'll take all you've got.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh, and a dozen lengths of rope.
Throw in some rags, too.

 
**Man:**
Yeah, sure thing. I'm glad you're taking this junk off my hands, but what will you use them for?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Who knows? But junk's got its uses.
You can put it together into something good.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Hey, this is a nice blanket.
Didn't think I'd see something like this. I'll take it.

 
**Man:**
That's an expensive blanket.
You sleep in your cape, what will you do with it?

 
**Robin Hood:**
My new boss is a wimp who's not used to camping.

 
**Mash:**
...Looks like he's buying a lot.
Should we talk to him, Master?

 
**Mash:**
Hello Robin, are you buying something?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh, Master and Lady Mash.
Fancy seeing you here.

 
**Mash:**
I'm kind of surprised to see you here Robin...
It's rare for a Servant to go shopping.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Maybe so. Compared to the other guys, I'm a little plain, right? I feel more at home in places like this.

 
**Robin Hood:**
But again, this is perfect timing.
I'm going hunting, want to tag along?

 
**Mash:**
Hunting? Is that code for you're going gambling?

 
**Robin Hood:**
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Not gambling, plain old hunting.

 
**Robin Hood:**
...Quietly. Quietly.
I saw some weird animal tracks around here.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I set some traps over the past few days... Got it!
Bingo! They fell for it.

 
**Robin Hood:**
This area up ahead is a blind alley.
It'll be easy to trap them.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You really did mean hunting...
 
**Robin Hood:**
Of course I did.
What did you think I was doing?

 
**Robin Hood:**
They didn't make me a Servant just because I'm good looking. I'm a master hunter.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What did you trap?
 
**Robin Hood:**
Haha, you'll have to find out.
Something perfect for a growing Master.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Robin, it's pulling!
The line is pulling!

 
**Robin Hood:**
All right, let's do this! This is some rare prey.
Don't let it escape, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
That was amazing!
Master, Robin is a master hunter!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Totally agree! Do it again!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's the best! Gimme more!
 


---
 
**Robin Hood:**
Hahaha, you're a greedy one, huh Master?
Let's move on to the next trap then.

 
**Mash:**
Roger!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Quietly, quietly...Oh, this one too.
Although this is one I hoped they wouldn't trigger.

 
**Mash:**
You hoped they wouldn't trigger?

 
**Robin Hood:**
Yeah, unlike the other place, there are signs of people staying here.

 
**Robin Hood:**
They're pros too, so they've hidden themselves well,
but... See? 3, 2, 1, 0.

 
**Soldier:**
GYAAAAHHH!
A trap! A hidden pit!

 
**Soldier:**
Scouts, what were you doing? There's spear tips smeared with cow dung on the bottom!

 
**Mash:**
I hear terrible screaming!
Robin, what was that?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Damn, enemy soldiers!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Damn! Definitely not a bonus character!
 


---
 
**Robin Hood:**
These guys were getting ready to attack the town.
See? This is important, too.

 
**Robin Hood:**
If we can get rid of them here, they can't hurt the town and the enemy won't know our location.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Just like they said, scouts are the most basic and critical part of war.

 
**Robin Hood:**
A bonus is important, but you need basic recon work too. Don't forget that, Master.

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yeah. Robin is right!
This is important too! No, it's more important!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, let's go, Mash!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Damn it! Let's do this, Mash!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Roger&mdash;I'll change my feeling of misplaced hope into rage, Master!

 
**Robin Hood:**
Oh, how brave!
Let's do this nice and easy. Nice and easy.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew!
We ended up going around the whole forest.

 
**Mash:**
But it paid off, bigtime.
Not just from the battles, but what Robin did.

 
**Mash:**
He's been protecting the town without them ever knowing, right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. Robin Hood is a true hero.
 
**Robin Hood:**
Aww, don't say that.
I'm not a hero even after death.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Aww, you should've just told us.
 
**Robin Hood:**
I'll admit I can be a bit of an oddball.
But you've got me all wrong, Fujimaru.

 


---
 
**Robin Hood:**
I don't even remember the people in town.
I just protect it because it's a nice place.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I'm not any different from the soldiers who attack the town. Just different tastes.

 
**Mash:**
...Um, what does that mean?

 
**Robin Hood:**
You know, I didn't want to go around crushing kids' dreams. But I may as well say it.

 
**Robin Hood:**
You guys talk about saving humanity, but that stuff's too big for me to really understand.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I'm a Servant?
It got to be some kind of mistake.

 
**Robin Hood:**
I was just a murderer with a rebel streak.
I didn't save anything.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But you saved the villagers.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There are people you saved.
 


---
 
**Robin Hood:**
That's just how things ended up.
I fought alone, and the village was safe for a year or two.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Sure, I fought the lord's army,
but that doesn't mean I wanted to save anyone.

 
**Robin Hood:**
You get it? I'm just a thug and a coward.
So be careful, Master.

 
**Robin Hood:**
It's dangerous to let your guard down because of my good looks. I'm a coward who'll run if he has to.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Anyway, we're done hunting, so I'll be going.
Might take a nap in the woods.

 
**Robin Hood:**
Call me if there's a fight.
It's my job, so I'll do whatever crazy things I have to.

 
**Mash:**
...He's gone.
But Robin contradicted himself.

 
**Mash:**
He said he protected the town because it was a nice place to be, but he sleeps in the forest.

 
**Mash:**
I think he...I think he's keeping his distance from what's truly important to him.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Some guys are like that, Mash.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...It might be too important for him.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
What does that mean...
Hey, why are you smiling like that?

 
**Mash:**
If you know the answer, please tell me!
Senpai, Senpaaaai!
