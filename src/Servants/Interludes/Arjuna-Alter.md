─── I confess that this is closer to repentance, and a far cry from a blessing.

One day, at a particular moment, I stopped fighting. I’m not sure when exactly that happened ― but I do remember the day I made that decision.

Mahabharata.

The battle where everything *spiraled out of control.* A great war in which god, man and beast were liquified into sludge. I then consumed that sludge, slurping it down as if it were soup. Forgive me, that was just a figure of speech. Truthfully, what I actually did was far worse.

“That was a mistake.”

Those words are easy to say, easy to understand once one has reached that conclusion. But I can't do it. I absolutely cannot.

But as I said earlier, there is one thing I regret.

I stopped fighting the moment I absorbed the pantheon. Because all the battles that followed were nothing more than solemn, stern, cold *prayers.*

At the very least, I should have fulfilled my duties as a warrior until the very end ───

I wonder what I must have been thinking. What I must have been contemplating about.

My sense of self has become terribly hazy. It's undeniable, *the reason* for this sensation.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> This is the Spirit Origin of my immature self...



Strictly speaking, this isn't true. No, if anything, I'd say that the immature Spirit Origin is far more perfect.

I was once a god. Instead of becoming a warrior, I became a god ― and I attained godhood. As a deity, I scaled down the world, cut it into pieces, arbitrated it, and purged it at the very end.

Ah, sin, sin, sin. I have far too many sins. But I can't be redeemed. Imprisonment or execution would be meaningless to me now.

─── I could spend the rest of my days atoning for my sins. That might yield forgiveness.

─── I could accept having my head lopped off. As long as that remains the ultimate punishment in life, that would not be a problem.

However, that punishment has already been executed. [I have already received it.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437151541934424078/1017675623889653841/Screenshot_20220908-175515_FateGO.jpg)

Yes ― the entity known as Arjuna *died once again.* He was defeated by Chaldea and Karna, and his sins were atoned for.

Sins must be atoned for. And the way Servants atone for their sins, is through their deaths. No matter how good or bad of a person they may have been, heroes and antiheroes alike have sin on their hands ― and that sin is washed away the moment they are summoned.

What's the point of loudly denouncing the sins of those who are already dead? An individual's sins should only be judged by their actions after being summoned. In that sense, we Servants can be equally evil and redeemable.

─── To continue to bear that guilt is nothing short of arrogance. That's what someone told me. I also believe that to be correct.

I can forgive everyone but myself. Even Karna ───

Even Karna. I can join forces with him if the need arises. Of course, long-standing ties can't be erased in a blink of an eye, but at the very least I can set them aside for the time being.

Which is why this body of mine possesses no sins. Even if it did ― that sin would be something to take pride in. For it would be a stain that was gained from protecting the correct history.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ...hah.



Yes, I understand it all too well. I keep trying to convince myself of it. Yet...no, I'm fine for now. I must focus on our battle.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Master, are you here? Master!



[Ritsuka runs up to him. Arjuna Alter smiles.]


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> We're still having technical difficulties communicating with Chaldea. It seems we have no choice. Let's get going.


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> Right, let's keep exploring for now.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Very well.

─── [The dazzling gleam of the city shines brighter than the moonlight.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437151541934424078/1017675624191635466/Screenshot_20220908-183457_FateGO.jpg) At the center of the Singularity, lies the Demonic Beast that has colonized the area.



[\[Flashback to before the Rayshift.\]](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437151541934424078/1017675624804012052/Screenshot_20220908-184104_FateGO.jpg)


> **Da Vinci:**
>
> This Singularity may be set in the modern era, but it's about to reach the realm of a Phantasmal Beast. On top of that, the location couldn't be any worse, so we can't ignore this one. We need to correct it immediately.


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> Roger!


> **Da Vinci:**
>
> The Rayshift personnel selected this time will be Arjuna Alter.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Understood. I shall do everything in my power to keep Master safe.


> **Da Vinci:**
>
> Please do!



[End flashback.]



This Demonic Beast that has established itself in a city of a certain country is certainly strong, frighteningly so...however, I am the pinnacle among Servants when it comes to combat prowess. Though I had to restrain myself to avoid causing any collateral damage ───

Nevertheless, I cleared out the entire area and cornered the Demonic Beast with a precise attack. But then ───

The Demonic Beast took to the skies and fled like a hare.


> **Da Vinci:**
>
> Chase after it!



With Sheba's analytical and tracking capabilities in tow, Master and I race together through the streets at night.

And then, the Demonic Beast fully revealed itself.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> A heavy pressure has materialized as soon as we reached this block, almost as if it is entangling us.



[Ritsuka nods.]



Perhaps this Demonic Beast's characteristics...its ecology, is like that of a spider. They spin thread to build their webs, wait for their prey, and capture their prey in their own territory. Unfortunately, the Demonic Beast that we confronted outside its web chose to flee and fight in its own territory...in that sense, Master and I have fallen into a trap.

The tepid wind carried with it a faint stench of death.

Most likely a significant number of people in this city have disappeared overnight. Does this Demonic Beast live by instinct or possess evil thoughts? Whatever the case, no doubt it is an irregular entity that can no longer be a part of human society.

Still, it's very unfortunate that communication with Da Vinci got cut off as soon as we entered the web. Master and I must find the Demonic Beast hiding somewhere on this block.


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> I found an information board.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Excellent. Somewhat primitive, but good for narrowing down the location. The building we are in is here. And this is where the pressure materialized. As far as my Clairvoyance can tell, this is about where the pressure ceases to exist.



Once you figure out the sites where the pressure materializes and ceases to exist, you can then identify the area to investigate.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> I knew it ― the building next door seems to be the likely option.



Master nods in agreement.

Naturally, the queen will be the one to position herself in the center of her web. Now, how to hunt it down? I find myself thinking about this ───

But at the same time I also feel relieved.

Ah, that's right. If the survival mechanism (system) itself is evil, I can wield my blade without any hesitation whatsoever.



＊＊＊



[A pungent, cloying poison.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437151541934424078/1017675627882627102/Screenshot_20220908-215115_FateGO.jpg) That's how I would describe this hue of mana.

Master and I are both immune to that sort of thing. As a result, we were able to continue our investigation with but a grimace on our faces.

This mana also reveals something else at the same time.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ...There are no more humans in this building. Every last one of them must have been taken in by that Demonic Beast.



─── The area surrounding this building is proof that the prey (people) have already been harvested.

I see, the reason that Demonic Beast left its web was because there was no more prey to catch inside the nest.

An entity that devoured that many humans in just one night migrated from their web. If left unattended even for a week, the city could completely disappear.


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> We have to stop it no matter what...!


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Yes. You are absolutely right. We must defeat that Demonic Beast, even if it means demolishing the surrounding area.



Evil, evil, evil. My sense of duty set alight, I become aware of an uncomfortable truth in the far back of my mind.

***If only humans were as plainly evil as ───***


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ...ngh!


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> W-what's wrong?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Pardon me. I punished myself for thinking such immature and arrogant thoughts, is all.



I was once a god. And because of that experience ───

My approach tends to be very shortsighted. Almost as if I am trying to justify my actions. Ah, how immature of me...how foolish of me.



[\[Flashback to Arjuna Alter talking with Ashwatthama.\]](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437151541934424078/1017675628620816404/Screenshot_20220908-223519_FateGO.jpg)


> **Ashwatthama:**
>
> ─── Hah, I see now. That really is a loser way of thinking!


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Agreed.


> **Ashwatthama:**
>
> But! That lameness is exactly what you need to *light up your soul!*


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> What I...need...?


> **Ashwatthama:**
>
> ─── You'll figure it out one day. Wise men aren't wise all the time. Fools aren't foolish all the time. *Everyone is capable of understanding beautiful truths*, things like that.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ......



─── This man used to be my comrade-in-arms. Ashwatthama's thoughts are somewhat hard for me to grasp.

I tilted my head at his words, and he laughed even more heartily.



[End flashback.]


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Master, how are you holding up in this fog?


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> I shouldn't stay in it for too long.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Very well. Fortunately, if that Demonic Beast is here ― it should either be on the roof or underground. It would be either one of those. And since it was not on the roof, the correct answer would be underground. I have no desire to stay here for too long. Let's finish it off quickly and decisively.



[\[Ritsuka nods. They go underground.\]](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437151541934424078/1017675628922798171/Screenshot_20220908-225629_FateGO.jpg)


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> There it is!



─── Shiver. A slight chill runs down my spine.

I readied my weapon, as if to shake off the chill.



---



**--BATTLE--**

[The Demonic Beast goes down with a strike.]


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> Alright!


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Our offensive tactic was effective, It should be dead now 
 ───



When I described the Demonic Beast earlier, I had called it a "spider." Not so much because of its physical appearance, but because of how it set up its web and traps like a spider would ───

However, I had failed to recall another key characteristic of spiders.


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> There's something...off about it.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> It's ───



[The Demonic Beast explodes, releasing miniature versions of itself.]


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> I was too careless...!



I had forgotten the fact that spiders could lay hundreds of eggs.



＊＊＊


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ─── Hah!



[Arjuna Alter kills three of the beasts in one strike. One shows up behind him.]


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> Arjuna, behind you!


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Got it!



Without turning around, I let my arrow loose. I could already tell that the arrow had hit its target and felled the monster.

We had no choice but to escape from the underground hall back to the corridor. The space was so vast that we easily could've been attacked from all sides. I cannot protect Master in this kind of situation, only myself.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> My apologies, I was far too careless...!


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> 1) Don't be, it would've happened anyway.
>
> 2) It's because we cornered it so quickly.



That may be. Nevertheless, I am still responsible for our current predicament.

Protect Master. Defeat the enemy.

If a Servant is unable to perform even their basic duties, they may as well be incompetent enough to cease to exist immediately.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Master, please give me permission to use my Noble Phantasm. We cannot afford to let those spiders get away. Each one of them has the potential to develop into the Demonic Beast we fought earlier. Once they reach the level of Phantasmal Beasts, they won't even need to lay their eggs anymore. Hence, this entire building must be demolished.


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> ...Alright, seems we have no choice.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> If it's any consolation to you, there are no humans nearby. Let's settle the matter before the damage escalates any further.



＊＊＊



[Outside the building.]


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Master, please wait here in this building. It'll be dangerous if you stay within the range of my Noble Phantasm.



[Ritsuka nods.]


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> I’ll be back then ───



[Arjuna Alter flies to the skies.]


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ...Hah.



─── I will be unleashing my Noble Phantasm now. The revolving sword of destruction, said to have no other equal in this world.

Every time I unleash my Noble Phantasm, I ponder. What was my former self as a god thinking, to obtain this Noble Phantasm?

The power of pure destruction that determines the end of all. I reassembled the world over and over again, with that Noble Phantasm ───

Did I really believe that would achieve peace?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ...Activate, sword of recursion.



The stars lose their illumination, all humans shall be judged by fate.

Inheriting the power of the gods, I shall carry out their duties.

As the world revolves, evil shall perish ───


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ......!



My Clairvoyance has spotted someone who shouldn’t be there.

The man is an everyday kind of evil. One who feels sorrow for the weak, but doesn't dare defy the strong. One who will never speak up against injustice even if he thinks it is wrong. The tendency of these individuals is to go along with the general public opinion once someone else speaks out against it. In other words, if someone starts throwing rocks at someone, he will wait for ten people to gather before joining in. That is the type of evil he is.

It was simply by coincidence that the man decided to approach the nest. A slight, sweet scent lingered in the air, which may have been what had caught his attention ───

But again, just a coincidence. Ultimately, that’s all it comes down to. ***Bad timing.*** His luck had finally run out.

If the man had been a few seconds late ― he would have seen the road in front of him suddenly cave in catastrophically. He might have collapsed in fear, perhaps even taken a video of the event, expecting it to go viral.

But the man had stepped into the way at the worst possible time.


> **Man:**
>
> ─── ?



The man had yet to realize that he had stepped into hell. A hell on this Earth, inhabited by giant spiders that could detect life and gleefully devour it.


> **Man:**
>
> ...Ah.



The man finally understood his predicament. Not because of his acquired knowledge, but through his instincts as a living organism.

***No human should be here.***

He should have honed his instincts a little more, however. After all, no stray dog or cat, not even a single rat, has tried setting foot on this block.


> **Man:**
>
> Ah, ah, ah.



The man doesn’t even have the mental capacity to scream. His mind broke the moment he encountered these creatures.

He stares with a dumbfounded look at the monster in front of him. It hisses, like a snake trying to intimidate its prey. And then the man finally comes to a realization.

He is going to die. He is going to be torn apart into pieces by the monsters’ fangs, without anyone being the wiser.

Unable to scream, all the man can do is stare at his impending doom.

Spending his precious, valuable time, as if he were gazing at a jewel.

Three. Two. One.

Just as the spider is about to sink its fangs into the man.


> **Man:**
>
> Huh?



A slash, then it dissipates.

Standing in front of him is a being even more terrifying than the spider.

Beautiful and ruthless, destructive yet sublime in form. His name is Arjuna, the great hero whose name is carved in the Mahabharata. An Alter, a different aspect of the great hero Arjuna.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ......!



Arjuna Alter is holding back the never-ending stream of Demonic Beasts.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Run!


> **Man:**
>
> Ah...eek...


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ......!



Arjuna Alter's face darkened, thinking whether the man wasn't running away because he was a coward.


> **Man:**
>
> I...can’t move...I can’t move...!



It’s not that the man didn't want to run away. ***He couldn’t run at all, in fact.***

Upon closer inspection, Arjuna Alter could see that the man’s hands and ankles were bound by thread. The man most likely couldn’t even see the thread, seeing as he wasn’t a mage.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> (Don't tell me...those creatures understand the concept of hostages?!)



Recognizing that Arjuna Alter had protected the man, the beasts promptly decided to hold him hostage.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Gghh…!


> **Man:**
>
> Ahh, get away from me! Get away! Save me! Save me please...!



The man's voice cracks. *Abandon him*, his rational side whispers.

Arjuna Alter had seen through the man's true nature with his Clairvoyance.



＊＊＊



The man is undeniably evil. From Arjuna Alter's perspective, at least.

He won't hesitate to trample over other people for his own benefit. He won't hesitate to look down on those he perceives to be inferior to himself. He won't get his hands dirty, besides hurting the feelings of said people. The only thing he gets out of this is a bit of vanity and self-satisfaction. But it was as if the man lived for that meaningless reward.

The man is well resented, but he will never be killed. ***After all, his actions are not heinous enough for someone to kill him over.*** So he will continue to survive and live a slothful life.

It's not like the man is a villain unparalleled in this world. People like him exist everywhere, enjoying themselves as if it is a given right. His lifestyle will not change until the day he dies. Regardless of what happens to the man ― the future of the world will not change whether he lives or dies.

However, if the man lives, the people around him may feel a bit sad. If he dies, he dies. Nothing more to it.

─── But does that mean I should leave him to die?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> (...This is bad.)



An evil that doesn't kill others, and only hurts others. An evil that will never be judged as a sin. Can I overlook such a matter?

"It doesn't matter. No one will be distressed if he dies in the process."

"Unleash your Noble Phantasm already and clear the surrounding area."

"It needs to be done to correct this Singularity. The more time I waste here ― the greater the risk I'm putting Master in."

That's right, Arjuna Alter thinks. Focus on the big picture. Don't mix up your priorities. I am Ritsuka's Servant ― and my priority is to protect the Human Order.

Redirecting my thoughts, I tried to clear my mind. Thinking it over, I tried to cast my other thoughts aside.

But I feel resistance. I mustn't forsake the evil staring me right in the eyes.


> **Man:**
>
> Eeek...!



The Demonic Beasts began pulling the man by the thread, perhaps out of frustration. Most likely the man instinctively knows that he is being dragged to his deathbed. As well as the fact that the being who took a glance at him is allowing this to happen.


> **Man:**
>
> S-save me! Please, save me...!



On countless occasions, the man abandoned everyone who begged him for help. They were purely related to social and economic matters ― but he didn't hesitate to abandon them. It's only when one is on the receiving end of being abandoned that they can experience it for the first time. Being seen as "worthless" by people, society and institutions ― can be as painful as one's innards being gouged out.

I tried to destroy evil. I tried to create a better world. Why was that?

Because evil seeks to harm good. Because evil seeks to destroy good.

I want to be an ally of virtue. I want to be on the side that is good.

That is what I wished and fought for. To not allow even a single evil to exist in this world.

***Is it right then, to forsake evil?***

Arjuna. No, Arjuna Alter. You consumed the power of the pantheon to become a god, and now you become a man once again.

Is your choice the right one?

─── The razor-sharp inquiry is suddenly thrust upon him.

Arjuna Alter takes a deep breath. Then he remembers.

Before I met Master, before I became a god. Long, long before all that.

I chose to fight and protect the weak. I chose to go down this path during my childhood, back when I was still alive. I decided to do so, without telling anyone. Regardless of my many mistakes, numerous destinies, and past karma that have led me astray ― that is the one thing I should never have forgotten.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ...That's right. It ───



Every time I gaze upon Master's fierce eyes, I can bring myself back to that beginning.

Ah, what is this?

Beyond good and evil, beyond righteousness and wickedness, beyond all that ― was a very simple and important emotion.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ***It leaves me with a bad aftertaste, leaving someone behind.***



─── That's all there was to it! I shouldn't have thought about it in such a complicated way. Clear and simple, just like Master. It doesn't matter if the person is good or evil. I decided to save the person, so my goodness is unwavering. Whether the person being saved commits evil or not is their responsibility, not mine.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> You over there.


> **Man:**
>
> ...Huh? Me?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Yes. As you can see ―well, I say that, but you probably don't know what I'm talking about. In any case, it appears your life is in my hands. So please assist me to the best of your ability.


> **Man:**
>
> Okay...?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ─── Ah, that was just a joke.



The surrounding area was crawling with spiders, almost like they forgot their purpose of leaving the block.

Yet, Arjuna Alter does not hesitate. He no longer has any doubts. Everything has neatly settled into place.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> I will focus exclusively on exterminating the Demonic Beasts. Can I leave that individual to you, ***my Master?***


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> Of course!



My doubts have now been cleared! Let's settle this once and for all!



**--BATTLE--**

His arrows, his sword, his brilliance, vanquished the Demonic Beasts left and right. He fired over one hundred slashes and shots, and though the battle was fierce, he remained firm and unwavering. Although it was a battle that was impossible for him to lose in the first place. Arjuna Alter completely annihilated the Demonic Beasts.


> **Man:**
>
> ......


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Forget what happened here, and go back to your everyday life. Go!


> **Man:**
>
> G-got...it...!



Forgetting to thank Arjuna Alter, the man leaves, almost tripping over his own feet in the process.

What will happen to that man? I do not know. Will his memories be erased by mages deployed to the field? Or will he still remember the events of that day? Will he repent and start to do good deeds, or will he continue to do evil without remorse? Or will he choose to ***strike a balance between the two*** like most humans are wont to do?

Frankly speaking, I was fine either way.

I had long since freed myself from the role of deciding between good and evil.


> **Da Vinci:**
>
> ─── There we go. Comms are back up and running! But judging by your vital signs, it seems you've already wrapped things up?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Yes, it’s over. The Singularity should be corrected now.


> **Da Vinci:**
>
> Let’s see...uh-huh. Yup, looks like it. Arjuna Alter, with some minor injuries, and Ritsuka-chan, without a scratch. No abnormalities in mental status, too.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> I would consider that a complete victory.


> **Da Vinci:**
>
> Hahaha, you’re not wrong there! Alright, it’s time to bring you back now. Good work, you two!


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> Roger!


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Good work, Master.


> **Ritsuka:**
>
> ...Did something good happen to you?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> No, not really. It’s not that anything good happened to me. But ― sometimes, it's the smallest, most trivial of events that helps everything click into place. I feel as if I have finally found the light of my soul. Now then, let us go back, Master.



[Ritsuka nods.]



Sin, punishment, redemption, salvation; they all exist.

Good, bad, righteousness, evil; they all exist.

But I get the feeling that I, as my present self, should fight to transcend all these concepts.

I believe in what I stand for. I believe in myself who chose to believe in Master.

I was once a god. I fought disastrous battles and performed disastrous deeds.

I will never forget what I did. But ───

Ultimately, it is a relic of the past.

As necessary as it is for me, it is unnecessary for Master.

The answers I have found are incomplete, missing, and inadequate as a life story.

If I must be honest, I need a more fulfilling answer. Something obvious and clear as day.

...but I’m sure that’s nothing but a bluff for me.

Continue to worry, struggle, and agonize. Even if there isn't an answer out there, I’m sure the path to reach it will be neither false nor meaningless.

[Back on the Storm Border.]


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Oh?


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> Hm, you’re Arjuna...or his Alter, rather.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> I suppose so...
>
> ...You're the boxer form of...


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> Incorrect. I am Santa Claus.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> I see...you know, I’ve always thought this.


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> Yes?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> You live a rather carefree life. I envy you for that.


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> ......
>
> Is that so...? Is that so...?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> I mean, I don't think you would parade around as Santa Claus if you weren't carefree.


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> I see what you mean...I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
>
> ......
>
> Alter of Arjuna.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> Yeah?


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> You wanna be Santa Claus?


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ...We should probably take a break from that kind of rehashing, in my opinion...


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> I see...that's a shame.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> ─── Yeah. But I'd be more than happy to help you hand out presents to the kids.


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> Of course, I’ll be sure to contact you when that time of the year comes around.



I brush past Karna as he walks away.

─── What a surreal conversation.

I try to hold back a spurt of laughter. I must look like a freak, laughing out in the hallway for no apparent reason whatsoever.

Get yourself together, get yourself together...

As I repeated that mantra in my head, I was dealt the final blow.


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> Oh yeah, Alter of Arjuna.


> **Arjuna Alter:**
>
> W-what?


> **Santa Karna:**
>
> You think I should include Ashwatthama with the kids?



I burst into laughter in the hallway, but I don't think it's a bad thing at all.

It was a very human laugh ― you could even call it the light of my soul.

For my soul laughs and shines bright.
