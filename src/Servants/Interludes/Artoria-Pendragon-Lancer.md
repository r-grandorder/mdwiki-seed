# Artoria Pendragon - Lancer

## Sacred Lance King of Knights

**Altria:**
I see. So the Holy City you saw was the avatar of my sacred lance.

 
**Altria:**
It is true there was a possibility that it could cause that. As you can see, I am rather lacking in humanity.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Lacking in humanity, huh... Now that you mention it, it's true that you feel a lot closer to the King Arthur we ran into in Fuyuki.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So are you saying that if you're displeased with Fujimaru, then you'll also become like the Lion King?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That you'll collect pure and noble humans, and use your sacred lance to imprison them?

 
**Altria:**
That's...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hi there!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Roman and Altria?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey there, Fujimaru. Good morning.
Need something from the Command Room?

 
**Altria:**
...I'll be leaving.

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm. She left without saying a word to you after she saw you, Fujimaru.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, after what happened in Camelot, I understand she feels awkward...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So I guess it's not going well then, Fujimaru?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She won't really talk to me about it...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She took off her helmet, but...
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. She often comes to me to ask for advice, but she might not want to show her summoner any weakness.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, time heals all. She may have the same Spirit Origin as the Lion King, but the two of them are separate Heroic Spirits.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Given the chance, I think she'll open up to you in an instant.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I hope so...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The chance? The chance, huh?
 


---
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Anyway, I'm going to lay down for a bit...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The chance... chance...
 


---
 
**Merlin:**
Good night! Welcome to Merlin's dream world!

 
**Merlin:**
What's this... REM sleep? That's not good! Did you go back to sleep after the alarm went off? Or are you taking a nap?

 
**Merlin:**
At any rate, I would suggest you get some deeper sleep.
I wouldn't be able to bug you until you do!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No doubt... This is a nightmare!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There he is, the root of all evil!
 


---
 
**Merlin:**
I see. You're asleep, but your judgment is still sound. This is why I hate REM sleep, where the brain's half awake.

 
**Merlin:**
Well, I'm just kind of an observer here, but I'd still like you to welcome me.

 
**Merlin:**
Why, you ask? Well, you're worried about Altria, aren't you?

 
**Merlin:**
Well, that's where I come in, you see.
Just leave it to me!

 
**Merlin:**
Altria's always been rather stubborn. But when she has her sacred lance, she can become a handful. Heh.

 
**Merlin:**
Geez, I wonder who would give anyone something so dangerous... I feel bad for that fool.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foooou!
(It's you, you nightmarish idiot!)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Fou!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I can understand what Fou is saying!?
 


---
 
**Merlin:**
Of course you can understand.
We're in a dream here.

 
**Merlin:**
To be honest, I'd never expect Cath Pa...
I mean Fou to be this close to you.

 
**Merlin:**
With Fou here, I can't feed you lies woven into truth. I wanted to tease you a bit more and have some fun, but...

 
**Merlin:**
Oh well, let's get down to business, then. You want to know what Altria is like when she's holding the sacred lance, right?

 
**Merlin:**
I'll lend you a hand, then. Fortunately, it seems like a channel is about to open.

 
**Merlin:**
To be honest, I can enter anyone's sleep.

 
**Merlin:**
During REM sleep, like yourself right now, the owner of the dream can “notice” I'm there, so I don't want to enter that much.

 
**Fou:**
Fou. Fou. Fou, fou, fo-fou!

 
**Fou:**
(That's right. This idiot here gets all powerless when he's being noticed in a dream. You can crush him like the bug he is right now.)

 
**Merlin:**
Hey, don't just go telling someone the secrets of an incubus! Besides, that's only when someone's in REM sleep!

 
**Merlin:**
Anyway, I'm going to have you enter non-REM sleep. Take a whiff of my special magical chloroform.

 
**Merlin:**
Very good. Now your mind will leave your body and soul, and move to the world of a certain Heroic Spirit's mind.

 
**Merlin:**
A flaxen-haired, green-eyed beauty. A shining lance.
An isolated king. This is the Heroic Spirit you will meet.

 
**Merlin:**
You can talk to them all you want there.
Anyway, I'll be leaving now, so don't worry about me.

 
**Merlin:**
When you wake up, you will be a certified Altria expert!

 
**Fou:**
Foooou!? (This scumbag here is just gonna do whatever he wants and run again!?)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Ouch...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Where am I?
 


---
 
**???:**
So you've finally awoken, my contractor.
Such a sinful human for making me wait.

 
**???:**
But I do understand. You are wondering about the true feelings of your contracted Servants...

 
**???:**
You wish to touch the shining inner mysteries of my spirit, shrouded in Mystics...

 
**???:**
It is only natural to wish so... It is inevitable.
No, a forbidden act dictated by fate!

 
**???:**
I shall allow it, you perverse voyeuristic spirit! I shall reveal my ever-so-charming true self here and now!

 
**???:**
I am none other than the true wielder of the shining lance! The blond, green-eyed king! Yes!

 
**Fionn:**
Fionn mac Cumhaill is here, now!
Now how about we shine!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're the one shining!
 
**Fionn:**
Of course. I am Erin's protector; naturally I sparkle. Well, I can dodge but I don't get invincibility.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So bright. I don't want to see any of it!
 
**Fionn:**
Hahaha, enough with the jokes.

 
**Fionn:**
I am not a certain beguiling Lancer! You should have no reason to avert your eyes from my beauty!

 


---
 
**Fionn:**
Anyway, let's set the jokes aside. I apologize, I got excited and wanted to have some fun.

 
**Fionn:**
I am here because I sensed the presence of evil. My pure-hearted Master is about to fall in the trap of an evil incubus!

 
**Fionn:**
I chased after that presence the moment I felt it.
Come, take my hand.

 
**Fionn:**
This kind of evil... No, perhaps not evil... Actually rather beautiful... I mean, what is this place?

 
**Fionn:**
It feels quite similar to my homeland... But I have no memories of a city being built with this kind of construction technology...

 
**Fionn:**
Tír na nÓg? Hahaha. No, it can't be. It's a bit too flashy and showy for the Land of the Young...

 
**Fionn:**
Look out! Who are you!? Show yourself!
You can't stop me from hugging [♂ him /♀️ her}!

 
**Altria:**
That should be my line. That human is my contractor. Keep your hands off.

 
**Fionn:**
Well well, if it isn't the wielder of the sacred lance, the King of Knights! I see, so you are the one dwelling in this evil city.

 
**Fionn:**
Hmm... This isn't good. This is really not good.
Can I excuse myself to bite my thumb for a second?

 
**Fionn:**
I can figure out the layout of this place and explain it to Fujimaru once my wisdom swells.

 
**Altria:**
...There's no need for that. When the time comes, I will speak with my own words.

 
**Altria:**
Now, hold your lance and not your thumb, Fionn mac Cumhaill. The price you pay for trampling into my world is quite high.

 
**Fionn:**
Hahaha. So that's how it's going to be, after all, huh?
I knew that was going to happen without biting!

 
**Fionn:**
I'd be mad too if someone trampled the memories of my homeland. This fight is unavoidable.

 
**Fionn:**
But before that, I think I'll confirm just one more thing.
Fujimaru, do you want to leave with me?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, I just got here...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...I'll stay here.
 


---
 
**Fionn:**
I can't believe you'd turn me down!
What a faithful Master!

 
**Fionn:**
But that's something to be happy and proud of.
I guess any annoyances should take their leave.

 
**Fionn:**
But it seems I have to pay the price first.
Isn't that right, knight of the sacred lance?

 
**Altria:**
Do not make me say it again. You talk far too much.

 
**Fionn:**
Or maybe you're just being too uptight? Don't you have anything to say to the Master that you chose?

 
**Altria:**
Of course my Master is going to choose my lance! There's no need to say that out loud!

 
**Altria:**
...Now reroute your magical energy to me, Master!
I will show you who is the better Lancer!

 
**Fionn:**
Very well! Then I shall face you with my full strength!

 
**Fionn:**
Needless to say, I'm summoning some Celt soldiers, too. That's what the full strength of a king is, okay?


**--BATTLE--:**

**Fionn:**
Ughhhh!

 
**Altria:**
Stand down, guardian of Erin! With respect to your exploits, I shall permit your retreat just this once!

 
**Fionn:**
Oh, how very kind of you! You seem to possess a semblance of sanity after all!

 
**Fionn:**
It's true that I'm just getting in the way! Farewell then! Goodbye, Fujimaru!

 
**Altria:**
...Well then, Master.
Why do you come to a place like this?

 
**Altria:**
This is the world of my memories.
Have you too come to expose my identity?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not my intent.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's all Merlin's doing.
 


---
 
**Altria:**
...Merlin?
Oh...I see. So that's how it is...

 
**Altria:**
But you bear some responsibility as well.
You fell prey too easily to Merlin's cajolery.

 
**Altria:**
If we had not formed a contract, you would already be dead. Exercise more caution in the future.

 
**Altria:**
I differ from other Servants. It is not necessary for you to understand me.

 
**Altria:**
You only need to give me orders to fight. Everything else is inconsequential. Especially “mutual understanding.”

 
**Altria:**
...Mutual understanding. Surely no such thing could exist between a human and me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why is that?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Even though we're talking right now?
 


---
 
**Altria:**
There is no reason.
I am not the King Arthur you know.

 
**Altria:**
By bearing the sacred lance for too long, I became a Heroic Spirit with a Heaven attribute, rather than one of Humans or Earth.

 
**Altria:**
...From your perspective, my vantage point is commensurate with a god's.

 
**Altria:**
So...I myself can no longer understand what is human warmth or laughter.

 
**Altria:**
What I consider “good” and what you consider “good” are surely different.

 
**Altria:**
I...am arrogant as I am merciless.
You no doubt noticed during the last battle.

 
**Altria:**
I punish what I cannot forgive.
I obtain what is valuable through force.

 
**Altria:**
I have not a shadow of a doubt that my way is just.
I suppose you could say I am a tyrant.

 
**Altria:**
Thus...

 
**Altria:**
If I were to enter your circle, I would trample the flowers of your human joy.

 
**Altria:**
My former self would have been loath to do such a thing.

 
**Altria:**
Perhaps I no longer understand such feelings, but I do not want to ruin the joy of others.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aren't you overthinking things?
 
**Altria:**
No. This is the truth, pure and unvarnished.

 
**Altria:**
What lies beyond is the Lion King you all have fought.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So I guess we fought a Lion Queen, not a Lion King...
 
**Altria:**
What? Ah, I suppose a female king is in fact a “queen”...

 
**Altria:**
I just don't like the sound of it. Am I uneasy because that hits a little too close to home...?

 


---
 
**???:**
...The vantage point of a god.
I see. Such is the anguish of someone with power.

 
**???:**
God neither saves nor forgives people.

 
**???:**
God is the law, the nation, the world. Such an order collapses in the presence of human warmth.

 
**Altria:**
Another trespasser...!?
Who are you? Reveal yourself!

 
**Romulus:**
One who became a divine Heroic Spirit at the end of your path for protection. Do not fear, do not fear...

 
**Romulus:**
My name is Romulus. Like you, I was worshipped as a god while I continued to walk the earth.

 
**Romulus:**
The shining emperor. The noble lance. The great tree soaring into the heavens. That is me, this is Rome!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Romulus, the Holy Progenitor!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's glimmering!?
 


---
 
**Romulus:**
Indeed, good words.
Fit for worshipping a god. Thus...

 
**Romulus:**
<span style="font-size:25px">&mdash;Die!</span>

 
**Romulus:**
&mdash;You blocked Rome's spear.
You resist the will of Rome.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Th-That was close...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks, Altria!
 


---
 
**Altria:**
What are you doing!
Is this how they do things in Rome?

 
**Romulus:**
You're not aware? A rightful person cannot endure the light of the sacred lance.

 
**Romulus:**
Perhaps you require an evil Master. One day, that person will go blind, heart gone cold, and become a mindless puppet who worships you.

 
**Romulus:**
You have no need for voices with a heart.
Nor do you have need for a heart.

 
**Romulus:**
Deus Ex Machina. Goddess of the Sacred Lance.
Return to your proper form.

 
**Romulus:**
That is why Rome journeyed forth.
To eliminate Fujimaru, your Master.

 
**Altria:**
Mind your own business, Founder Romulus! I show no mercy to those who try to lay a hand on my Master!

 
**Romulus:**
What nonsense! The Lance from the Ends of the World stands no chance against the Spear of the Founder!

 
**Romulus:**
Come, my children, my infinite branches and leaves! Show Rome your heroic selves!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Altria:**
Ugh... How can Rhongomyniad be inferior? Impossible... Yet the truth is that I cannot break through!

 
**Romulus:**
Don't you understand, King of the Sacred Lance?
You are not drawing out the sacred lance's full potential.

 
**Romulus:**
Or should I say you were not intoxicated by it.
You fought to protect your Master.

 
**Romulus:**
However, it was not a fight to protect the world. Naturally, your lance would lose its radiance.

 
**Altria:**
What...! My lance remains! It is as radiant as ever!

 
**Romulus:**
...You leave me no choice.
I did not want to resort to action that's Un-Roman.

 
**Romulus:**
However, sometimes violence is necessary.
And that is now, Fujimaru.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...He's coming!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A frontal assault to finish us off...?
 


---
 
**Romulus:**
I ask of you, Fujimaru.
Say you love Altria Pendragon!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whaaaaaat!?
 


---
 
**Altria:**
Wh-What are you saying, you cur!
So barbaric, is that how Romans fight!?

 
**Altria:**
Ignore him, Fujimaru, just keep channeling magical energy to me!

 
**Romulus:**
All appeals from the peanut gallery are rejected!
Fujimaru, say, “I love her!”

 
**Altria:**
Just how long do you intend to make a fool out of me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Of course I love herrrrr!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I! LOVE! HER!
 


---
 
**Altria:**
Whaaaaaat!
Um... Right... Thank you!

 
**Altria:**
No! Wait, I mean, wait! I do not require respect from my contractor!

 
**Romulus:**
Well, what if [♂ he /♀️ she} said the opposite?
What if [♂ he /♀️ she} shouted, “I hate you!”?

 
**Altria:**
I would be extremely sad!
Even I can get hurt sometimes!

 
**Romulus:**
Precisely. So your own words betray you, King of Knights!

 
**Romulus:**
You not only rejoice in your Master's love, you also hold your Master in esteem.

 
**Altria:**
...Um, we just share the standard relationship of trust between Master and Servant...

 
**Romulus:**
That is fine. That is how it should be.

 
**Romulus:**
Knight of the Sacred Lance. You are the child of a dragon, yet you are human, and strive to be human.

 
**Romulus:**
Your soul still burns with passion. You possess a god's vantage point, but fall short of a god's heart.

 
**Romulus:**
You failed to become a mechanical god.
And that, precisely, is&mdash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Rome, right?
 


---
 
**Romulus:**
...Indeed. Rome is adventure&mdash;

 
**Romulus:**
The symbol for all that is human, graduating from the Age of Gods and gaining the heart to love fellow men as a human.

 
**Altria:**
...I still do not possess... the heart...of a god...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're the same Altria as always.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're still the King Arthur of legend.
 


---
 
**Altria:**
You think so? It's hard...for me to accept, but...

 
**Altria:**
...But, if you, my Master, say so, perhaps it is true.

 
**Altria:**
Hah hah. Being told something like that in such a loud voice would surprise anyone, of course.

 
**Altria:**
Allow me to apologize. I said that you could not understand me.

 
**Altria:**
I will not retract that comment. It is an unshakeable fact that we are different.

 
**Altria:**
But... I may have been stubborn. There are times we may understand each other despite differing positions.

 
**Altria:**
With that, will you fear me, or rely on me?
I shall see firsthand.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. I'm counting on you, Altria.
 
**Altria:**
Yes. I look forward to our future time together, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I admit I'm a little scared.
 
**Altria:**
Y-Yes, that is true. I do not know...and it is not my fault, but...

 
**Altria:**
I heard the Lion King stormed through the Holy City, so I will try not to turn out like that...

 


---
 
**???:**
Bwahahahaha! King of Knights, you've finally warmed up a bit!

 
**???:**
I've been waiting. I've been waiting so long for this moment!

 
**???:**
This is the perfect chance!
A Chance-sseum Tentyris!

 
**???:**
Prepare yourself! You're not exactly my type, but I've always wanted to make you bow before me!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This voice...!
 
**Altria:**
...I see. Not being able to take a hint was something this excruciating...

 
**Altria:**
I shall be careful myself, and not barge in when no one wants to see me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Doesn't this dream have too many guests!?
 
**Altria:**
Yes, I agree. I shall make sure Merlin gets his just punishment someday.

 


---
 
**??? & ???:**
How dare you rub PDA in our faces and ignore us!
There are two of us here! Who do you think we are!?

 
**??? & ???:**
Bear witness to our earth-shattering alliance!
We&mdash;

 
**Gilgamesh & Ozymandias:**
We are the first two kings of an ancient, golden age!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Gilgamesh and Ozymandias...!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah, be as heartless as you can and crush them.
 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Altria:**
Well then. Is there anything else on your mind?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Not particularly.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Gotta thank Romulus.
 


---
 
**Altria:**
...I wanted to speak more... about the sacred lance, and myself...

 
**Altria:**
But it seems we are out of time.
Soon you shall awaken.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well then, next time.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll visit you when I wake up.
 


---
 
**Altria:**
Yes, let us go back, Master.
Or should I say, “Let us wake up.”

 
**Altria:**
Until we meet again, my Fujimaru.
In the meantime, I shall practice how to smile.
