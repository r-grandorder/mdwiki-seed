# Thomas Edison

## Can I Do It?

**Mash:**
Senpai, have some tea.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Thanks.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
It's a rare day off.
Please relax.

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 
**Mash:**
It seems Fou is happy to take it easy as well.
I'll pat his stomach.

 
**Fou:**
Foouuuuu.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What a peaceful day.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. If only these days went on forever...

 
**Mash:**
...Hmm.
I guess this is what you'd call “Murphy's law.”

 
**Edison:**
Another failure!
Hmph, something's missing!

 
**Edison:**
Electric power, or raw materials. Or maybe something else. ROAR, I wonder.

 
**Mash:**
W-What's wrong, Edison!?

 
**Edison:**
Good morning, Mash, Master!
Oh, just trying to slightly improve my Noble Phantasm.

 
**Edison:**
While tinkering here and there,
it suddenly exploded with a “boom!”

 
**Edison:**
Hahahahaha! Failures are not good, but I expect nothing less from my Noble Phantasm. Even when it activates accidentally it packs a punch!

 
**Mash:**
Your constant thirst for knowledge is impressive, Mr. President.

 
**Mash:**
But, there are other Servants here as well.
Please avoid creating a scene, especially in the hallway.

 
**Edison:**
But my room is so cramped.
Experiments require space, you see.

 
**Mash:**
Even Tesla respects the rules here, you know?

 
**Edison:**
ROAR, don't compare me with that dimwit!
Sorry, miss. Next time I'll start with the “mute” function.

 
**Edison:**
But it doesn't hurt to try, right? With upcoming battles in mind, strengthening a Noble Phantasm is essential.

 
**Edison:**
But seeing how I'm failing to make progress,
I may need to change my way of thinking...

 
**Mash:**
Change one's way of thinking...

 
**Mash:**
If I recall correctly, turning inventions or unimaginable discoveries into something more polished...

 
**Mash:**
That was the greatest triumph for Thomas Edison...

 
**Mash:**
Why don't you try improving your Noble Phantasm with the same mindset?

 
**Edison:**
Hmm, I suppose you're right.

 
**Edison:**
However, I find myself at a loss when thinking only about my own Noble Phantasm.

 
**Edison:**
Perhaps if I use the Noble Phantasms of other Servants as reference...

 
**Mash:**
O-Other Servants... You say?

 
**Edison:**
Very well then!

 
**Edison:**
Let's start making contact with other Servants in Chaldea right away!

 
**Mash:**
But are you sure that's okay? A Noble Phantasm is the embodiment of a Servant's pride...

 
**Mash:**
To be so openly investigative about their abilities is somewhat...

 
**Edison:**
Who cares if it's okay or not!
For the time being, we need to try!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right, for the time being!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Right, we need to try!


---
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, it all comes down to the same thing!

 
**Edison:**
So, that being said, here's what I came up with!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...Hey, Master!
So why'd you call me here?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I have a bad feeling about this,
and I'm also not a huge fan of that witch over there.

 
**Edison:**
Don't worry, Cú Chulainn.
This will be for your own good as well.

 
**Medea:**
...Umm, maybe I don't look like it, but I'm kind of busy.

 
**Medea:**
As a Caster I give lectures to other mages and make adjustments to the backyard...

 
**Medea:**
I also have to make sure that my former self doesn't say anything outrageous.

 
**Edison:**
Of course, my fair lady.
What I have to say shall also be of use to you as well.

 
**Medea:**
...I see. I guess I'll at least hear what you have to say.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
A “lady.” (Scoff)

 
**Medea:**
I don't know what you're scoffing at, but for now I'll kill you! Rule Breaker!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You still have a short temper, don't you!? Also you unleash your Noble Phantasm way too fast&ndash;!

 
**Mash:**
P-Please calm down, Medea!

 
**Edison:**
That's it!
I've got it!

 
**G：Everyone:**
Huh?

 
**Edison:**
I've been thinking about it for some time.

 
**Edison:**
Cú Chulainn's Gáe Bolg can overturn fate,
piercing its target no matter what course it takes.

 
**Edison:**
On the other hand, Lady Medea's Rule Breaker not only destroys all magical support...

 
**Edison:**
...it's also an Anti-Magecraft Noble Phantasm even capable of severing a Servant's contract!

 
**Edison:**
So that's when I came up with my idea!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...What exactly can a lion come up with?

 
**Edison:**
This powerful body is not that of a lion, but the manifestation of a beast of wild intellect!

 
**Medea:**
So you do agree that you're a beast.

 
**Edison:**
Of course, I wake up an hour early every morning to brush my fur and... Wait, I'm getting sidetracked.

 
**Edison:**
Just listen to me! I'm going to weld together Cú Chulainn's Gáe Bolg and Medea's Rule Breaker!

 
**Edison:**
No matter who the Servant may be, this revolutionary Noble Phantasm will overturn one's fate and sever any contract!

 
**Edison:**
I shall name it “Edison-type Bolg Breaker!”

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Hey, Master!
Can I go back now?

 
**Medea:**
...Please tell me more.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Witch!?
I mean, uh, Medea?

 
**Medea:**
Actually, the thought has occurred to me before.

 
**Medea:**
Approaching enemies for each Rule Breaker isn't really a Caster's job, right?

 
**Medea:**
It's tiresome, dangerous, you get splashed with blood, and you almost trip stepping on the hem of your robe.

 
**Medea:**
So, if you could quickly activate a Noble Phantasm with that lance of yours, that'd be perfect.

 
**Medea:**
I mean, I didn't obtain my Noble Phantasm from my adventures. It's a materialization of my legend of treachery.

 
**Medea:**
So, I'm not too attached to it.
I almost wouldn't mind forcing it on someone else.

 
**Edison:**
As always, Caster, your logical thinking is so elegant.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You muscleheads, no, mageheads!
Just because it's convenient doesn't mean it's good!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I love my Scarlet Lance!
It's totally a part of my identity!

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes, I see.

 
**Mash:**
Cú Chulainn acquired the legendary Gáe Bolg only after harsh training and discipline.

 
**Mash:**
It would be wrong to carelessly tinker with it&ndash;

 
**Medea:**
Who cares if we lose a spear or two?
Should I call Scáthach to give us spares?

 
**Medea:**
Or maybe I should say.

 
**Medea:**
“Your pupil is such a stingy warrior that he won't even let go of a single spear.”

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Damn you. You hit a sore spot...
This is exactly why I can't stand witches... Fine, here.

 
**Edison:**
Thanks for your assistance!
Noble Phantasm modification... Here I go!

 
**Edison:**
All right, it's done!
The “Edison-type Bolg Breaker!”

 
**Edison:**
Fuhahaha!
Behold its elegant design!

 
**Edison:**
Oh, a patent! I must get a patent!
No matter what, patents come first!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Oh, my Gáe Bolg... My perfectly efficient crimson spear... It looks so fancy!

 
**Edison:**
Now now, Cú Chulainn.
We must experiment first.

 
**Edison:**
Fortunately, there's a Servant who would gladly volunteer for this experiment.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, isn't that convenient!? How nice that such a weird Servant just popped up like that!

 
**Emiya:**
Hmph. To think you'd modify your Noble Phantasm.
And here I was thinking you were a savage.

 
**Emiya:**
I know Edison's a modern man, but for someone born in the Age of the Gods, that's quite a flexible way of thinking.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
SO HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU!?

 
**Medea:**
Of course. Not only is this playboy of a mage calling himself Archer, he's also a repeat offender of Noble Phantasm theft and illegal modification!

 
**Emiya:**
That's not very nice, Caster. But you know there's a saying...

 
**Emiya:**
My Noble Phantasm is my Noble Phantasm. Your Noble Phantasm is still mine after I copy it.

 
**Mash:**
E-Even this Noble Phantasm that I'm holding on to!?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
There isn't a saying like that! You know other Servants will kill you if they hear you say that, right!?

 
**Emiya:**
Of course, I choose my opponents. To the ones that are like “I really don't like mine copied,” I will do it in secrecy.

 
**Emiya:**
But the ones that are like “Why don't you try it punk,” I will project their Noble Phantasms right in their faces.

 
**Emiya:**
Difficulty level is a factor as well.
I can't easily project a Noble Phantasm like Gáe Bolg.

 
**Emiya:**
Similarly, Mash's Noble Phantasm is also something I can't easily imitate.

 
**Mash:**
T-Thank you very much.
I'm glad, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash, you are my one and only!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes! Master, I'll devote myself to my training!

 
**Medea:**
Youth, huh...
How touching...

 
**Emiya:**
Well, let's try projecting one.
Are you ready, Edison!?

 
**Edison:**
Yes!
Cú Chulainn!

 
**Edison:**
Give it a shot!
I'm here to back you up!

 
**Edison:**
Assuming there would be actual combat,
I prepared a random enemy for you!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Ugh, enough already!
This one strike, accept it as your farewell gift!

 
**Mash:**
Commencing battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Medea:**
Time to finish this.
Archer has started chanting.

 
**Edison:**
Okay, perfect timing!
Cú Chulainn, now!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I got this! Once the fight starts, I won't hold back!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
“Bolg Breaker,” here we go!

 
**Edison:**
It's “Edison-type Bolg Breaker!”
Don't forget!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Yeah, yeah. “Edison-type Bolg Breaker!”

 
**Emiya:**
It's been a while, but here I go!
Rho Aias!

 
**Mash:**
Whaaat!?

 
**Mash:**
Emiya-senpai, you possess a shield-type Noble Phantasm!?

 
**Mash:**
I-I'll make sure I take notes!

 
**Edison:**
Let's see which one will come out on top!

 
**Edison:**
Of course, I'm confident that my “Edison-type Bolg Breaker” will win!

 
**Edison:**
A blade that could cut through all forms of Magecraft would surely pierce that shield-type Noble Phantasm!

 
**Medea:**
Huh? That's impossible you know?

 
**Medea:**
I mean, my Noble Phantasm works against Servants,
but not against other Noble Phantasms.

 
**Medea:**
It would be especially tough when the target's a shield created precisely to ward off attacks.

 
**Edison:**
What!? Was I mistaken on such a fundamental concept!?

 
**Edison:**
Which means, in this case&ndash;

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
It broke!?

 
**Mash:**
The welded Rule Breaker bounced off!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Ah.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Ah&mdash;!?

 
**Mash:**
The Rule Breaker rebounded on...
on Cú Chulainn's head!?

 
**Mash:**
I-I've seen this somewhere before!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Altrium!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
AHOGE!


---
 
**Mash:**
That's it!

 
**Edison:**
Ugh, I didn't weld it on hard enough!

 
**Edison:**
I thought that Rule Breaker could easily pierce Emiya's shield!

 
**Edison:**
But I guess if you charge it head-on...the great Rho Aias still comes out on top!

 
**Edison:**
The experiment...has failed!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Who cares! Could you take this off already!?

 
**Medea:**
Yeah, sure.
Here you go.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Ugh... Now I have a headache. I can't even bust through a shield...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I've thought I would resent someone's low ranking Luck as much as this...

 
**Mash:**
Umm, I don't think Luck has anything to do with it this time. It's simple a reckless experiment.

 
**Edison:**
Perhaps it was a bit reckless trying to modify someone's Noble Phantasm...

 
**Edison:**
Even though Fujimaru summoned me,
at this rate I'll remain useless...

 
**Mash:**
Edison...

 
**Emiya:**
Mr. Edison, don't you think you're giving up a little too fast?

 
**Emiya:**
The idea itself isn't a bad one. Rule Breaker is a broken item that could sever any contract.

 
**Emiya:**
If you could land a direct hit, any Servant would be liberated from the bonds of its contract.

 
**Emiya:**
...So. For example, why not try matching it with Hrunting?

 
**Emiya:**
That Noble Phantasm pursues the enemy it sniffs out. A different type of Noble Phantasm from reversing cause and effect.

 
**Edison:**
Oh, Emiya, you understand me!

 
**Emiya:**
Of course. You see,
weapon modification and improvement are my forte.

 
**Mash:**
For some reason, Emiya-senpai sounds different than usual!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Extremely suspicious!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't you think he sounds more natural now?
 


---
 
**Medea:**
Of course, that boy... I mean, snob, used to be a well-mannered person to start with.

 
**Medea:**
But a lot happened and now he's a bit twisted.

 
**Emiya:**
Don't badmouth people to their face!

 
**Edison:**
Oh... It's just as Emiya says!
I can't give up after only one failure!

 
**Edison:**
Once we're back in Chaldea, let's revisit what we just talked about and discuss our next plan!

 
**Mash:**
...Master, I have a feeling we shouldn't bring the two of them together.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's head back, eat, and hit the sack!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai is trying to escape reality, too!
Please get your act together!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's pretend we didn't see any of this!
 
**Mash:**
You can't run away, Master!
We're responsible for this disaster!

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Anyway, Master, prepare yourself.
I'm pretty sure Edison will, most definitely...

 
**Mash:**
Come up with another crazy plan!

 
**Edison:**
All right, then how about this!? Adding transformations and combining mechanisms would surely make it exciting!

 
**Emiya:**
You are a genius! But wouldn't forcing the joints like that make the connecting parts more fragile?

 
**Edison:**
Silly, that's our chance to make it look even cooler!
Add in bolts and armor plates to give it more volume...

 
**Edison:**
...and it will be twice as large after combining!
I have a feeling this thing will sell as a toy!

 
**Emiya:**
Always looking at the positive side of things!
I'd expect no less from the King of Inventions!

 
**Emiya:**
Yes, this is wonderful!
Well then, how about doing this?

 
**Medea:**
...Oh, shut up.

 
**Medea:**
This is why I can't stand men who pursue their dreams and adventures. They're all good-for-nothings.

 
**Medea:**
A grown-up who's a bit mellow, and calm in his judgment. That's my ideal man.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Who cares?
Anyway, could someone hurry up and heal me?

 
**Mash:**
Sorry, I forgot!

 
**Mash:**
Oh... Senpai!

 
**Mash:**
Speaking of forgetting things, what happened to strengthening Edison's Noble Phantasm!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I forgot!
 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fou foou.

 
**Mash:**
I think that Fou said, “It's hopeless!”
He's given up too!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
On to the next one!
