# Fergus mac Róich

## Pretty Illusion

**Fergus:**
Sorry to bother you during your break.
I'm looking for the Servant Consultation Room. Is this it?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're closed today...
 
**Fergus:**
Hm, just as I thought.
But I'm begging you. It's urgent, you see.

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yes and no?
 
 
**Fergus:**
Hah hah hah. You deny and say it isn't so, but your face tells me you've given up on refusing, Master!

 
**Fergus:**
You're probably fed up with indulging the selfishness of Servants day after day. I sympathize with you.

 
**Fergus:**
So now, I'd like you to just give up again. I've got an urgent problem.

 
**Fergus:**
Could you hear me out?

 
---
 
**Fergus:**
Hah hah hah, don't be so shy!

 
**Fergus:**
War is important, but whispering words of love to a woman is equally important to me.

 
**Fergus:**
Of course, I'd never force myself on an unwilling woman. Understand that I just want to look at her and hit on her.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai!
I found sweet rice cakes in the Doctor's room!

 
**Mash:**
These are quite exceptional.
Let's eat them before anyone finds out.

 
**Mash:**
But of course, the main topic is investigating the Doctor.

 
**Mash:**
We must solve the mystery of how the Doctor stockpiles sweets in this time of scarcity...

 
**Mash:**
Oh? Is that you, Fergus?

 
**Fergus:**
Oh, hello Mash.
Well, I want to ask you, too.

 
**Fergus:**
You see...

 
**Mash:**
I understand the circumstances,
but maybe that's not such a good idea.

 
**Mash:**
I mean, we are fighting to prevent humanity's destruction...

 
**Mash:**
If you carelessly start hitting on other Servants, it may end in a bloodbath...

 
**Fergus:**
Hmm, what a mess...

 
**Fergus:**
If at least I could tell which Servants are okay to hit on...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Heh, leave stuff like that to me.
More like, why didn't you come see me about this?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, those sweet rice cakes look pretty tasty.
Let me try one, nom nom...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, this is as tasty as the one from my own collection,
or rather, it tastes exactly the same...

 
**Mash:**
Senpai's sweet rice cake!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mash's sweet rice cake!
 

---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You two get along so well.
That aside, Fergus.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I installed several Servant profiles into the virtual training system.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
They're a bit robotic, but they should at least respond to you.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So try this out first, and if it looks good, you can go hit on them for real. How does that sound?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It will be good for future reference.
I'll use the results for personal reference.

 
**Fergus:**
Hmm... An interesting proposal.
Let's give it a shot!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai. I'm not sure why, but I have a bad feeling about this.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay, transfer confirmed.
Why don't you try sweet-talking the first one?

 
**Fergus:**
All right, bring it on!
Now, what kind of perky lass will appear&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...Uhh.
What's a “perky lass,” exactly, Senpai?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Maybe a beauty that makes his crotch perk up?
Oh, here she comes!

 
**Fergus:**
Well, if it isn't Brynhild, the Valkyrie!
...Hey, wait, wait, wait!

 
**Fergus:**
Don't you already have a boyfriend?
I'm not a fan of stealing another guy's woman...

 
**Fergus:**
Hmm. Well, I don't like it, but exceptions must be made for lust.

 
**Fergus:**
Brynhild. I want you.
Why don't you spend the night with me?

 
**Mash:**
(...A very straightforward and completely unambiguous approach...)

 
**Brynhild:**
Oh...I don't know how to respond to such a frank confession of love&ndash;

 
**Fergus:**
Hmmm.

 
**Brynhild:**
I guess I'll just have to kill you...

 
**Fergus:**
Yup, I don't get why, but so be it!
You're even more ferocious in love than the Celts!

 
**Brynhild:**
I have no idea who you are, but thank you.
Now let us fight to the death...

 
**Fergus:**
Fujimaru, Mash, my bad!
I was so close, but I failed!

 
**Mash:**
We can see that.
Oh geez, Master, get ready for battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
That was quite the ordeal...

 
**Fergus:**
Hah hah hah, if you get depressed by one or two failures, you're gonna have a tough life.

 
**Fergus:**
After all, everything, even life, is just a night's dream. You've got to live decisively.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
How reliable... You are a teacher, no,
I must say, a guru of smooth talkers...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
All right, Guru Fergus!
I will prepare the next Servant!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
This time it'll be fine. Based on looks,
I chose a charming, peaceful woman!

 
**Kiyohime:**
...
...

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai, I think he will strike out.

 
**Fergus:**
I think so too, but I can't help it when met with such beauty! Hey there, foreign lady!

 
**Kiyohime:**
...
...

 
**Kiyohime:**
Ah, are you referring to me?
I beg your pardon. Do you need something?

 
**Fergus:**
Yes. I liked you the moment I saw you.
How about it? Spending the night with me.

 
**Kiyohime:**
...
...

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh, my.
What shall I do...

 
**Mash:**
Wait, he actually has a chance?

 
**Fergus:**
Hahaha, no need to be shy.

 
**Fergus:**
I don't mean to brag, but I, Fergus, am an acknowledged authority on how to make women happy&ndash;

 
**Kiyohime:**
What did you just say?

 
**Kiyohime:**
An acknowledged authority on making women happy?
So, in other words&ndash;you mean “infidelity.”

 
**Fergus:**
...Hmm. Hah hah hah!
My bad! It seems I've stepped on a land mine, Master!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Guru Fergus&mdash;!

 
**Mash:**
As I expected!
You keep stumbling at the first hurdle!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Destroy infidelity!
Destroy womanizers!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Go repent in hell!
Hi-yah!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Fergus:**
Hmm, it's not going too well.
I hope this time a compatible Servant will show up.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, we should make a bet.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
MUDA MUDA MUDA.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I think it's no use.

---
 
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I think so as well.

 
**Fergus:**
Hah hah hah! Master, you're quite harsh.
However, rest assured. This is a tent, thus, the wild.

 
**Fergus:**
Being here means it will most likely be a ferocious woman, a warrior!

 
**Fergus:**
I know well how to woo such a woman. Well now, Doctor!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
An unshakable heart of steel...
That is our hero Fergus!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Honestly, I'm starting to realize this is useless, so I want to go back to work... But I hope for the best this time!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The Servant up next is&ndash;her!

 
**Nightingale:**
...Huh?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I think we should run.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To the ends of the earth.

---
 
**Fergus:**
Oooh, is this not the nurse that took care of us in America?

 
**Nightingale:**
I only have business for the wounded. Please leave.

 
**Fergus:**
Don't be so cold.
Actually... I have a serious illness.

 
**Nightingale:**
...Let's hear it. What is wrong?

 
**Fergus:**
Uh, it's like a gaping hole has opened in my chest...

 
**Nightingale:**
Is it pneumothorax?
Or perhaps heart failure?

 
**Fergus:**
Nothing like that, it's more of a mental problem. I've got an emptiness from the lonely nights spent alone.

 
**Nightingale:**
...Meaning?

 
**Fergus:**
Yes, I refer to the disease of love...
My heart is unspeakably cold and empty!

 
**Fergus:**
But, my beautiful lady with bosom so supple and buttocks so round!

 
**Fergus:**
I do think you are capable of filling the gap in this chest. If you would, please!

 
**Nightingale:**
...
...

 
**Mash:**
Nightingale, um, it's fine if you just flat out refuse him...

 
**Nightingale:**
No. On the battlefield, it's just an unavoidable instinct for warriors to seek proof that they have lived.

 
**Nightingale:**
Assaulting helpless nurses is one thing.
But, if I am the one nominated, that's a different story.

 
**Mash:**
Huh&ndash;!?
S-So, that means!

 
**Mash:**
You're going to give him the okay!?

 
**Nightingale:**
Yes.
I will respectfully counter his attack.

 
**Nightingale:**
After all, I am currently a nurse who possesses combat skills.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, so that's what you meant!

 
**Fergus:**
Hah hah hah hah! In other words, you mean if I win the battle, I can have you!

 
**Fergus:**
Fine by me, I'll take you on!
Master, this will be a decisive battle... Let's go!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Fergus:**
Yes, victory is mine!

 
**Fergus:**
By the way my beautiful lady, is it my imagination,
or were all your attacks concentrated solely on me?

 
**Nightingale:**
No, you're not imagining things.
...Be that as it may, I will admit defeat.

 
**Nightingale:**
Do as you wish, Fujimaru.
My body is yours.

 
**Fergus:**
Don't you mean mine!?

 
**Nightingale:**
?

 
**Nightingale:**
The winner is not the Servant,
but the Master who commanded them, is it not?

 
**Fergus:**
That logic is so sound I don't know what to say!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
N-Now wait just a minute!?
 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes!
It's not like Master fought with such an idea in mind!

 
**Mash:**
...Isn't that right, Master?
ISN'T. THAT. RIGHT?

 
---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm sorry, some other time!

 
**Mash:**
Exactly!
Senpai is on a mission to save the world.

 
**Mash:**
Getting sidetracked is, well...all sorts of danger, I think!

 

---
 
**Nightingale:**
I can't believe this... You're the winner, yet you don't want your prize.

 
**Nightingale:**
Well then, until next we meet.
Goodbye, Fujimaru.

 
**Mash:**
Whew... That was close.

 
**Mash:**
Well, if you asked me what was so close,
I wouldn't know the answer myself...

 
**Fergus:**
Hmm, so my last chance also ended in failure after all.
I can't help but feel my self-confidence dwindling.

 
**Mash:**
Ah, um... Er, well. Whatever the reason, I think your straightforward courtship is wonderful.

 
**Mash:**
Please don't be discouraged, and keep trying.

 
**Fergus:**
...
...

 
**Fergus:**
Miss Mash. If you'd like, after this&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
Oh, that would be a no, thank you.

 
**Fergus:**
Rejected...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Guru Fergus...
