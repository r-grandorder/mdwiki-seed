# William Shakespeare

## Curtain Call

**Shakespeare:**
Hm...Master, can I have a minute?
This town lacks something. What do you think it is?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Smiles.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Happiness.
 


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
Exactly! The world is a stage, and the men and women coming and going on it are performers.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Regardless, there is no smile in this town.
No happiness. Why is that&ndash;?

 
**Shakespeare:**
It's because there is no drama!
If so, shall we put up an improv for people to see?

 
**Mash:**
An improv? ...And you said "we."...
By "we", you mean...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Why, of course I mean myself, Mash Kyrielight, and Master Fujimaru.

 
**Mash:**
I-Impossible!
I've never seen or performed a play!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, you haven't?

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes. I'm sorry for my inexperience...
But there was never any need for me to...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Hahaha, what are you talking about?
That need is more apparent than ever for you!

 
**Shakespeare:**
What you need right now is love, words and poetry!
A kindled passion is exactly what you need!

 
**Mash:**
Ohhhh, but...

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, and a shield and weapon, too.
It's kind of sudden, I know&ndash;

 
**Citizen:**
Monsters!
Monsters are coming&ndash;!

 
**Shakespeare:**
But monsters are coming all of a sudden, you see!

 
**Mash:**
W-Why is that&ndash;?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
W-We should deal with them.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's protect everyone!
 


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, what a courageous line!
But I wish you'd made your delivery a bit more complex.

 
**Shakespeare:**
"Hear your death bell ringing! Are you going to heaven, or to hell!" ...How about that?

 
**Mash:**
Uh, excuse me.
Please join the battle!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Shakespeare:**
Oh, how valorous you were.
You are majestic even when standing behind me, Master.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Well, the Holy Grail War is a fine thing. It's a war that contains elements common to historical plays, tragedy and comedy!

 
**Mash:**
I'm...glad to hear that.

 
**Shakespeare:**
See, hear the thunderous applause.

 
**Citizen:**
You were so cool, kid!

 
**Citizen:**
I love you, let's make a baby!

 
**Citizen:**
Who's giving out the orders behind that girl...
A king, emperor, or a general...?

 
**Mash:**
Wh-Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

 
**Mash:**
L-Let's get going, Master!

 
**Shakespeare:**
I wish I could work out the lines a little more there...

 
**Mash:**
Give me a break...!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Well, it's important to select words with care.
I hope you'll work harder next time.

 
**Mash:**
Wh-What?
Did you say&ndash;Next time?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Yes.
Listen, Mash, Master.

 
**Shakespeare:**
You two are the protagonists of this play.
A girl and her master rise up to save this town.

 
**Shakespeare:**
The girl is a steel knight with a fragile heart.
The master is a vulnerable human with a steel heart.

 
**Shakespeare:**
By going hand in hand, the two characters begin to transform from craven to courageous.

 
**Shakespeare:**
And standing in their way&ndash;

 
**Shakespeare:**
Are diabolical beasts beyond human understanding.
Unable to communicate, they are incompatible.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Their sad existence is fated to be hostile to humans.
By delivering the final blow, the two heroes are able to move on.

 
**Shakespeare:**
It is a treacherous path denying them even sleep, the one balm for their wounded bodies and souls.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Regardless, they have no regret, despair, or resignation.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Even if what they fight against is the great existence constituting the framework of the universe&ndash;

 
**Shakespeare:**
You two shall march onward!

 
**Mash:**
...Excuse me, but I have one question.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Sure, what is it?

 
**Mash:**
Sorry if I'm wrong, but are you summoning those enemies&ndash;?

 
**Shakespeare:**
...Well!
It's time to fight, Master!

 
**Mash:**
Answer my question!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
(panting...)

 
**Shakespeare:**
And now it's time for the climax!

 
**Mash:**
Uh, are you sure you didn't summon them?
With the power a Caster might use, maybe?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Sorry, but I'm not skilled in magecraft at all.
I'm a writer, after all.

 
**Mash:**
Right.
You do have a point there&ndash;

 
**Shakespeare:**
Anyway, there's a villain who's feeling frustrated.
Let's say, his initial is 'S.'

 
**Mash:**
S?
Um, Mr. Shakespeare? So it is you&ndash;

 
**Shakespeare:**
The villain named S grows impatient with the town's neverending peace, curses the people, and to top it all off, he comes up with a plot!

 
**Shakespeare:**
It was to use the townspeople!
To incite the townspeople, and turn them into daemons so he can make them attack our heroes.

 
**Mash:**
What!?
Shakespeare, is that&ndash;!?

 
**Mash:**
No way...!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
They have no people to protect, no friends to share laughter with.All they do now is shiver with loneliness&ndash;

 
**Shakespeare:**
"You can give in." The demon whispers.
"You can rest now." The nightmare murmurs.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Well, well, well, what are you going to do, Mash Kyrielight? Indeed, what are you going to do, Fujimaru&ndash;My Master!?

 
**Mash:**
Ugh...
Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We are such stuff as dreams are made on.
 
**Shakespeare:**
Ha!
I didn't expect that answer!

 
**Shakespeare:**
It essentially means transience, that everything you struggle for in life is merely what happens in your dream.

 
**Shakespeare:**
But, however&ndash;you are different.
You've perceived a different meaning in it.

 
**Shakespeare:**
A dream is hope.
Hope is what is laid with courage and determination.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Then, your battle speaks for itself.
For you are the dream!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't care about philosophy.
 
**Shakespeare:**
Heheheh, I knew you'd say that!
What you just said is absolutely true, Master!

 
**Shakespeare:**
A demon's whisper, reasonable conclusion, and compelling valid argument.All those kinds of things&ndash;

 
**Shakespeare:**
You're welcome to get over them simply by saying, "I don't care!"

 
**Shakespeare:**
Because it is evil in the name of a valid argument.
It is a cowardly trick trying to camouflage the evil with a facade called theory.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Just go ahead and do it!

 


---
 
**Shakespeare:**
You are great, Master.
You are fantastic and invincible!

 
**Mash:**
...Yes.
He's absolutely right, Master.

 
**Mash:**
I have no doubts. If there's no way to turn them back, we just need to defeat them.

 
**Mash:**
I'm coming with you, Master!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
We defeated them...!

 
**Shakespeare:**
Oh, we must hail your victory! ...Now that they won the battle, the end of their dream comes.

 
**Mash:**
Huh&ndash;?

 
**Mash:**
O-Oh?
The town...is gone!?

 
**Shakespeare:**
Excellent job, Master.
And you, Mash Kyrielight...the shield and sword.

 
**Shakespeare:**
The dream is now over.
You gathered the beautiful threads of your story.

 
**Shakespeare:**
Now, let's walk toward the rest of the story. I am certain the transient dream and illusion shall satiate your mind.

 
**Shakespeare:**
...And of course, for me, too.

 
**Mash:**
From...where to where was it a dream...?

 
**Shakespeare:**
&ndash;Heheheh. Of course, that's a secret.
Playwrights never reveal their methods so easily.
