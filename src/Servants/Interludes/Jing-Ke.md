# Jing Ke

## The Wind is Strong and the River Cold

**Jing Ke:**
Ah, Master and Mash. Good timing.
There is a thing I want to ask you.

 
**Mash:**
Sure, what's going on?

 
**Jing Ke:**
I want you to train with me. I want a simulated battle, but its setting is a little complicated.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Roman taught me how, and I memorized it...
But, I have a bad feeling.

 
**Jing Ke:**
My intuition never fails in this kind of situation.
I'm sure I will kill, no, I will break that device.

 
**Mash:**
I-I see. That's one fantastic intuition.
And, it's good you talked to us about it.

 
**Mash:**
Let me take care of fine-tuning the settings.
You can always count on me.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Oh, I appreciate it.

 
**Mash:**
So, how do you want it?

 
**Jing Ke:**
Defeat the king, this is what I want to train.

 
**Mash:**
Understood. I suppose a situation similar to the one you were once in is all right?

 
**Jing Ke:**
Of course!
That's the way it should be.

 
**Mash:**
Then, the simulated battle will start now.

 
**Jing Ke:**
As you already know, I failed to assassinate the first emperor.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Nevertheless, I'm really thankful of Master for summoning me and letting me serve.

 
**Jing Ke:**
But, I can't just relax like this.
I must succeed, even if only virtually.

 
**Jing Ke:**
To slay with this dagger, I'm still a little far.

 
**Jing Ke:**
So, I will go one step closer.

 
**Jing Ke:**
...Of course.
Soldiers rushed to his rescue.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Only unarmed civil servants were around the first emperor, but I can't expect such a good situation every time.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Then, let's start slaying them.
As fast as possible. From now on speed is everything.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jing Ke:**
And move another step forward. If there is a mage,
he will summon something to protect the king.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Let's see.
A tough, defensive golem would be perfect.

 
**Jing Ke:**
I must slay it instantly, too.
Polish up the dagger's edge even more&ndash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jing Ke:**
And, it's almost over.
Now, the only remaining prey is the king.

 
**Jing Ke:**
...I made a mistake here. I misjudged the emperor to be an immobile, corrupted man.

 
**Jing Ke:**
He was tyrannical, but at the same time, he was great.
I should've considered he could move and confront me.

 
**Jing Ke:**
He knocked down my flying dagger, and ran away quickly while I was slightly shocked.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Yes, this is the end.
I will take the king's head&ndash;let's go!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Jing Ke:**
...Yes, this is the end.
This is checkmate for the king.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Of course, in this case I'd perish too, but that can't be helped. Though virtual, I think it's good enough.

 
**Jing Ke:**
After all, this is nothing more than a fabrication.
The fact remains that I failed to assassinate the first emperor.

 
**Jing Ke:**
But if I sacrifice my body, certainly I will be of some use to you.

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't want you to die.

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't waste your life.
 


---
 
**Jing Ke:**
...Ah, you're right.
I will gratefully accept your kindness.

 
**Jing Ke:**
But unfortunately, this is the only way I know how to fight. And this is the reason I was summoned.

 
**Jing Ke:**
You must use me.
And when I vanish completely, lament for me.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Your tears are my everything.

 
**Jing Ke:**
That way, I would be able to think that my sacrifice had served a purpose.

 
**Jing Ke:**
...Don't worry.
That doesn't mean it will happen.

 
**Jing Ke:**
Until then, I'll enjoy this world with drink in hand.
