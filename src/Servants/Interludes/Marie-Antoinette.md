# Marie Antoinette

## Queen of Lily and Emperor of Rose

**Marie Antoinette:**
All together!
Vive La France♪

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Vive La France♪

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou-foou♪

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!
Marie!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is this?
 
**Mash:**
...Um, well.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Vive La France!
 
**Mash:**
...You too, Senpai...?

 


---
 
**Mash:**
When the Doctor said he wanted to summon Marie to Chaldea for something&ndash;important,

 
**Mash:**
I thought it might have something to dowith repairing the singularities, but...

 
**Mash:**
I never thought that "something important"
was telling her he's a big fan.

 
**Mash:**
But...

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Ready, go♪
Vive La France♪

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou-foou♪

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!
Marie, you're the greatest!

 
**Mash:**
They are having so much fun, so I'm going to leave them alone for a while.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Vive La France♪

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou-foou♪

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!
Marie!

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Okay, now we're getting excited♪
But it would be better with more people.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hey, Doctor.
Is there a place we can go with more energy and people?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Of course!
The Second Singularity, the repairing Rome!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
There shouldn't be any enemy Servants, so I can guide you there safely!

 
**Mash:**
Huh?
S-Senpai, the Doctor's saying that&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Can't hurt, can it?
 
**Mash:**
R-Really?
...I guess you're right. It can't hurt.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
MARIE!
 
**Mash:**
Senpai??

 


---
 
**Fou:**
Fooou!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Okay!
I'll get the Rayshift system ready right away!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
My, what a wonderful place&ndash;

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
So this is the ancient Roman Empire, the land that all the nobles of Europe dreamed of.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
The buildings are splendid, and there're so many people!
And look at all these smiles!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
This is a great place!
Thank you for bringing me here, Doctor♪

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Not at all. Anything for you, Queen Marie.
But there was one mistake I made...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
You need an operator to perform the Rayshift, which means I have to stay behind...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...This is the biggest mistake of my life.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou-fou♪

 
**Mash:**
The wars have ended and everyone's full of energy.
I'm glad&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I wonder if Nero's doing okay.
 
**Mash:**
I'm sure she is.
Not knowing history, just knowing her.

 
**Mash:**
That's how it seems to me.
But I know she's got a lot of trouble ahead...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Should we...not say hello?
 
**Mash:**
No. Rome's being restored, so Nero may have no memories of us.

 


---
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh?

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh? Oh?
I see a splendid palace over there.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's different than the ones in my era.
The town and palace are both different.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I'd like to see what's inside.
Heheh, let's go take a look!

 
**Fou:**
Fooou♪

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Come along, Fou.
Let's take a tour inside that palace♪

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 
**Mash:**
...Um, um, Senpai? Marie is heading further and further away. Let's go after her!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hmm, so this is how it looks.
It looks elegant, but it's also sturdy and strong.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I feel strength within the beauty. Perhaps it comes from the trust and pride toward this country's culture.

 
**Mash:**
W-We finally caught up...
I can't believe she just walked right inside the palace.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
As expected of the French Queen.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Amazing, huh?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes...
She passed by the palace guards with just a smile...

 
**Mash:**
She has a noble aura, you could say.
Like she belongs in any palace.

 
**Mash:**
Her words, her expression, even her smallest movements, they're all so noble that even I might...

 
**Mash:**
If I were a palace guard, I might let her in too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
She truly is the last queen of France&ndash;
Amazing...just amazing...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I wish I could have seen her walking through the real Versailles Palace, and smiling by the fountains...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If one of the singularities turns out to be 18th century France, maybe I'll get the chance...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But sadly, the Rayshift system won't let us travel to any location except the singularities.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If only all the other eras hadn't been incinerated...sob...

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Huh?
What's this over here?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Is it a throne? An ancient Roman throne!
How wonderful!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Come here, Fou.
We'll look at it together!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foou♪

 
**Mash:**
Oh.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
She ran off again!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's follow her, Mash!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Right, Senpai! We'll follow her!
Oh, she's surprisingly fast!

 
**Nero:**
...?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
(Grin Grin)

 
**Nero:**
And you are...?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
(Grin Grin)

 
**Nero:**
Umu. Are you a foreign royal? I sense an intense royal aura about you, though it does not rival my own.

 
**Nero:**
For you to come before my throne, you must be.
Umu, I shall allow it.

 
**Nero:**
But where are you from?
Seneca said nothing about an audience...

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Nice to meet you, Emperor.
I am Marie.

 
**Nero:**
Umu.
I am Emperor Nero Claudius.

 
**Mash:**
(Oops! We ran into Nero!)

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Marie the White Lily Queen, and Nero the Rose Emperor! What a picture! Save an image, Mash!)

 
**Mash:**
(R-Right now is not the time!)

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Um, I have a favor to ask of you.
May I speak?

 
**Nero:**
What royal family are you from, again...?
Hmm? What do you wish to ask of me?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That throne&ndash;

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I'd like to sit on the throne of the ancient Roman emperors!

 
**Fou:**
Fou♪

 
**Nero:**
Wha&ndash;

 
**Nero:**
Y-You say you want my throne?
Does that mean&ndash;you want to become Emperor?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
?

 
**Nero:**
I don't know what family you're from, but you are indeed a bold rebel!

 
**Nero:**
Very well!
I see I must show you what I'm capable of!

 
**Nero:**
I shall allow it! Pick up your sword!
If you truly want the throne, seize it by force!

 
**Nero:**
We emperors have ruled Rome since the time of Romulus! You who oppose us, behold the might of the Emperor!

 
**Mash:**
W-Wait, Nero&ndash;
Um, we're not here to fight!

 
**Mash:**
(And Nero is a human from this time period!
There's no way she can fight a Servant!)

 
**Nero:**
Hmm? Have I met you&ndash;
somewhere before?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh&ndash;Oh, right. The era is repairing itself, and she's started to forget about us, maybe.

 
**Nero:**
No, I remember your name at least.
Mash and Fujimaru, was it?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? She remembers and forgets?
Maybe she'll remember tomorrow?

 
**Nero:**
You're with Marie, then?
Very well! I'll fight you too!

 
**Nero:**
Oddly, the headache I've had all day is gone!
No one stands a chance against me at full power!

 
**Mash:**
Wait&ndash;
Huh? What...What's this...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's wrong?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I'm sensing powerful magical energy from Nero!
She wasn't a mage in life, though!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
H-Huh? I'm picking it up here too!
What is this? It's Servant-class!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What's going on!?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Uh...? Huh?
What is it?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah! Queen Marie has no idea what's happening!
We're about to start a duel with Emperor Nero!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oh, I see&ndash;
Good luck and do your best, Fujimaru.

 
**Mash:**
You're just making us do it?

 
**Nero:**
Let's begin!
May the thunderous applause echo here!

 
**Mash:**
There's no stopping her now! Commencing battle&ndash;!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...S-She's strong.
How can the human Nero be so strong?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Where is all this energy coming from?
Did something happen to Emperor Nero?

 
**Nero:**
I'm feeling great today!
I feel like I could expand our borders tomorrow!

 
**Nero:**
Marie, was it?
I can't give you the throne, but that was splendid.

 
**Nero:**
I love your beauty. You have the purity that's lacking in Rome. It would be a shame to pluck such a pretty flower.

 
**Nero:**
You can sit on the throne a little later when no one is here. Tonight, we'll have a banquet!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I'm honored, Emperor!
Right, Fou?

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou♪

 
**Mash:**
Fou really likes her...
A-Anyway, I'm glad neither of them died.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...They're friends now, too.
 
**Mash:**
That's right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're gonna eat tonight!
 
**Mash:**
We did use a ton of magical energy.
I want you to fill yourself up, Senpai.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm so jealous... You guys get to join a banquet,
and all I get to do is watch...

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Hehe, we'll bring back presents, so don't be sad Doctor.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Queen Marie!
Oh, Vive La France!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Vive La France♪

 
**Fou:**
Fou fou-foou♪

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Vive La Fra&ndash;nce!
Marie!

 
**Nero:**
Hmm? What's this?
I don't know, but I'll join in! Vive La Rome!

 
**Fou:**
Fou fou-foou♪

 
**Mash:**
...


## The Fragile Lily

**Mash:**
Where...?

 
**Mash:**
Where is this place?
I think I was resting at Chaldea...

 
**Mash:**
I was trying to...
sleep in my room, I think...

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&ndash;That's right.
You were all asleep.

 
**Mash:**
What...?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So sleepy...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Huh? Marie?
 


---
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You're both awake, then.
Good morning♪

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
However, you both are actually still asleep.
So am I, more precisely.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Your bodies are dreaming, but your minds are with me.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
So you can't hear the Doctor here.
You can't contact Chaldea.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
You understand what I'm saying now, don't you?

 
**Mash:**
We're dreaming...?

 
**Mash:**
The records say that a Servant and Master can share memories in their dreams.

 
**Mash:**
But this...
For us to recognize each other&ndash;

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's because Chaldea's summoning system is slightly different than normal summons.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's what happened.
Or perhaps,

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
"You" are the only one dreaming, and the others are just characters in your dreams.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Which means&ndash;
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
???
 


---
 
**Mash:**
The dream of the butterfly, right?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I wonder.
Who's the dreamer, and who's the dream?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But there's one thing I do know.
Especially for me.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
This is...
The place I must walk.

 
**Mash:**
The place you must walk...

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
This is my Temple.
Not the real one, of course.

 
**Mash:**
The Tour du Temple&ndash;
The place where Marie Antoinette awaited execution.

 
**Mash:**
Then this is your mental landscape?
This space, no, this place.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's what it looks like to me.
How does it look to you?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
If my memories are reaching you, then it must look the same to you. Otherwise, perhaps you're seeing 
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
the closest place to it in your own memories.
Heheh, don't get scared, okay?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It's all right.
I'll be sure to lead you to the exit.

 
**Mash:**
That means we need to find a way to escape, doesn't it?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes. &ndash;I'm sorry.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
These are my memories. What was once in my heart.
A world where I waited for death, with no escape.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But you two are different.
And so I can get you out.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's escape.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's go together.
 


---
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Yes.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Come, let's go.
To the outside. To your real world.

 
**Mash:**
...It's a labyrinth, isn't it?

 
**Mash:**
But I don't really feel lost.
Is this your doing?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes.
Because you two are here.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I don't know if I could escape on my own.
These are my memories of sorrow and misery.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But you are here for me.
I'm connected to you as a Heroic Spirit.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
And so I won't lose my way.
I'll make it to the exit&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...Wait.
Multiple presences detected ahead.

 
**Mash:**
Magical energy responses?
Wait, these aren't from living creatures.

 
**Mash:**
...Though I don't know if you can feel magical energy in a dream.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
This is what I once felt.
It's fear, death, and of course, sadness.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...It's all right.
We can win.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Get ready, Mash.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's break through.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master.
&ndash;Moving to engage enemies!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...We defeated them!

 
**Mash:**
Good thing the summoning system was working.
It must be because it's linked to your existence.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Whew! We made it.
There's no way that we'll lose.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I was sad when I was here, but I never gave in to despair.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Even if I died, even if my husband the King died, even if my beloved children died...

 
**Mash:**
Marie&ndash;

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Even if the people forget the royal family's white lilies, France will be eternal.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's what I believed.
I believed that this was necessary for France.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's why "giving up" is the one thing I didn't do.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
It may change form, but France is eternal.
The white lilies of glory shall never fade.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Vive La France!
Glory to our nation, France!

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
...What a joke.

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
That's nothing but self-deception. The foolish lies of a foolish queen, killed by her foolish people.

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
The man you loved was killed. Your children were killed.
And yet, Vive La France? Really?

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
You're a liar.
Tell them what you really think, why don't you?

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
You want France, and its foolish people who trampled on your royal white lilies, to die.

 
**Mash:**
This is...
A Servant? No&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Another Marie?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A Shadow Servant?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
The presence is almost identical.
If this is really a dream, then...

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, Mash is right.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Both of us are real.
Both of us are me.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I am the "Marie" who never gave up.
She is the "Marie" that did.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
I am the "Marie" who decided to regret nothing.
She is the "Marie" who sorrows, rages, and curses.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Both of us...are me.
Neither is a fake.

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
No, no.
You're a fake, Marie.

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
I'm the real Marie Antoinette. A foolish queen who broke her heart trying to save her people, and was betrayed!

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
My curse upon France!
May it suffer a millennia of starvation and war!

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
May it be crushed&ndash;
Under the wheels of endless revolution!

 
**Mash:**
...Maybe it's because this place is special, but I can feel her rage.

 
**Mash:**
It's a burning torrent of emotion, as sharp as a knife.

 
**Mash:**
She carried this inside of her...
And she still always smiled at us&ndash;

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Pathetic, aren't "I?"
How could I forget smiles and love?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
No matter how much I am hurt, or hated, I can never stop smiling.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Shouldn't that be the duty of a Queen?
No matter what my end was&ndash;

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Say, why don't we stay dazzling?
Let's smile at everyone, every nation, and the world.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That is the "Marie" who decided to leave her mother and become the White Lily of France.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
That's why...
I will not accept you.

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
How dare you, Marie Antoinette! In that case,
I will make you succumb to me, and I shall rise!

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
They want to incinerate the world?
Fine! Let them!

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
The people, the country, the world that stole my life and the lives of the people I loved!

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
Let it all be destroyed, with no records or memories left!
The guillotine is too good for it!

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
&ndash;I can't bear to listen to this anymore.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Your cries are my cries, but I don't want to hear them.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
...Come Fujimaru.
Tell me what to do, my "Master."

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're leaving this place!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Defeat her and press on!
 


---
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Oui. &ndash;Let's do this, Mash.

 
**Mash:**
Right, Marie!
Master, let's go&ndash;Commencing anti-Servant combat!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Marie Antoinette?:**
...Hmm, I see.

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
So you're fine with this.
After the way you were betrayed.

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
And you're still smiling?
I see...

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
...That's really who I am, isn't it?

 
**Marie Antoinette?:**
Vive La France.
The exit is just up ahead...

 
**Mash:**
...The enemy Servant has vanished.
The battle has ended.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Thank you, both of you.
Sorry to get you caught up in this.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
But I feel just a little better. You got the chance to see me do something besides smile.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Now I have nothing left to keep from you.
And I can go back to smiling and loving.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Vive La France, my Queen.
 


---
 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Yes, Vive La France!
Come on, let's go.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
If you happen to remember this dream&ndash;
After you wake up.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Please don't tell the Doctor or Fou, all right?
Promise me?

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
If at all possible, I only want those two to see me smiling.

 
**Mash:**
...Of course, Marie.

 
**Marie Antoinette:**
Heheh♪ I'm counting on you!
