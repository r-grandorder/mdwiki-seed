# Jeanne d'Arc - Alter

## That Which Must Be Corrected

**Jeanne Alter:**
I was born in a dark abyss, devoid of any light.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I know why I was made.
Ugh, what awful taste in women.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I don't remember who said it...but a voice echoed in my mind... “Vengeance is sweet.”

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...But I lost. And from that moment,
nothing held any meaning for me anymore.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Not my existence.
Not my life.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Not my mind.
Not even the concept that is me.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And that's why I need to start over from the very beginning.

 
**???:**
Extra Classes are different than the standard seven, each with their own roles.

 
**???:**
...The Avenger is the most unusual of them all.

 
**???:**
The Ruler class has the unusual responsibility of regulating a Holy Grail War. However, you might say the very existence of the Avenger Class is unusual.

 
**???:**
What's more, her existence in particular is something of a peculiar one, born as she was of the omnipotent wish granter, the Holy Grail...

 
**???:**
By basing her existence on a hero named Jeanne d'Arc, Jeanne Alter was accepted by the world.

 
**???:**
What was her second birth like?
Well, that's a story for another day. In any case...

 
**???:**
She probably cannot stand the fact that her existence is based and depends on Jeanne d'Arc.

 
**???:**
To Jeanne Alter, even if her existence is like an ephemeral dream, a mere bubble... No, perhaps it is BECAUSE she knows how fragile her existence is...

 
**???:**
She attempts to use her own strength alone to keep afloat, so to speak.

 
**???:**
I am at a loss for words. She might be an Alter, but she's every bit as serious and stubborn as her other self.

 
**???:**
Master, please do your best and don't lead her astray.

 
**Billy:**
I got you now!
Guess today's not your lucky day, huh?

 
**Mash:**
I guess not...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You sure it's luck we're talking about here?
Billy, you didn't pull any dirty tricks, did you?

 
**Billy:**
Of course not.

 
**Billy:**
I just want you to know, I am fully capable of distinguishing between those that I should play dirty with and those I should not.

 
**Billy:**
Mash is the sort I shouldn't.
It was an honest duel.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Split.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Stay.
 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Are you serious!?
Why would anyone break up a hand like that?

 
**Billy:**
I see, you are going for a big win here, huh?

 
**Billy:**
...Well played. You won.

 
**Billy:**
That was a good move, but not good enough...
Ah, I won. Black Jack.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No way!


---
 
**Mash:**
That's too bad, Senpai...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I see you're pretty good at this, that's some skill you got there. You got a future, kid.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Anyway, what are we playing next? You might be quick with your hands, but I won't lose a bet! The night's is still young and&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whoa, we got a rare guest here...


---
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I was wondering where all the noise was coming from. Just a bunch of morons addicted to gambling, I see.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Everyone needs a bit of entertainment from time to time. Wouldn't you say so, Fujimaru?

 
**Mash:**
I agree. We've been fixing minor Singularities nonstop lately.

 
**Mash:**
What is it, Jeanne?
If there's anything I can do, I will be glad to help you...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...I'm not Jeanne.
Don't lump me in with that stupid saint.

 
**Mash:**
Really!? Oh... Um...
In that case, Dark Jeanne?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Wrong again.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I am a part of Jeanne d'Arc that broke off from her.
I'm my own, original being.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You may call me Jeanne Alter.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jeanne Alter, wanna join us?
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
No, I don't want to.
People CHEAT at cards, right!?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I know exactly what sort of thing goes on in card games! Yes, I do!

 
**Billy:**
Hey, that's kinda prejudicial of you.
Not that you're wrong though, generally speaking...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
So you WERE playing dirty.

 
**Billy:**
No I wasn't!
I said “generally speaking.”

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Whatever.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Fujimaru, time to go fix some Singularities. Don't think for one second that you get to just laze about.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did something happen?
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Precisely.
I need to go fix a minor Singularity.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
And you're coming to help me.
Got it?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
If you say no, then I'm just going to bother you until you say yes.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
I haven't received any reports about a Singularity being detected...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Yes and no.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...There are places that can't even be classified as minor Singularities, but I know that eventually, some will.

 
**Billy:**
I see. That's quite the claim.
Is that your intuition as an Avenger speaking?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...You could say that.

 
**Mash:**
But Senpai hasn't had a break like this in a while...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Duty calls, let's go.
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It's your obligation as a Master.
C'mon, time to go.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
All right, let's do this!
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm glad you're motivated...but I hope this isn't you being sarcastic.

 


---
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, I can't just sit here and ignore a Singularity.
I'm coming with you, Fujimaru.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Billy, you coming?

 
**Billy:**
Um... Nah. Pass.
Don't think I'd be useful this time anyway.

 
**Billy:**
Y'know, I do know someone who can help, though.
Be right back.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...How selfish.
I see outlaws are all the same.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Pot, meet kettle.
You're really not one to talk about being selfish.

 
**Mash:**
Now that a well-deserved break is gone, I do worry about Senpai's health... But, I will go get ready to navigate for you guys!

 
**Da Vinci:**
I am not seeing anything here.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
No shit.
It hasn't become one yet.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I really want to know how you know all this, but...

 
**Da Vinci:**
I guess that can wait till later.
I'm going to trust you for the time being.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Servants accompanying the Master on this Rayshift will be... Cú Chulainn, Jeanne Alter, and...

 
**Geronimo:**
Me.
The kid asked me to join them.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, it's a rare sight to see you on missions.

 
**Geronimo:**
Perhaps.
The kid has keen intuition, though.

 
**Mash:**
I understand.
He's a tough opponent in card games.

 
**Geronimo:**
So, where are we Rayshifting to?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
France.
Former First Singularity.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The Foundation of Humanity is currently being restored there.

 
**Mash:**
...!

 
**Geronimo:**
France... A former Singularity...where the Hundred Years' War of Evil Dragons took place.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Exactly. I guess you could say we're here to clean up the mess that Singularity left behind.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
In other words... Time to exorcise some bad spirits.
We have to.

 
**Mash:**
Jeanne Alter, what do you mean by bad spirits?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Just come with me.
You'll see.

 
**Mash:**
Wait, Jeanne Alter!

 
**Mash:**
...She ran off.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I guess we'll just have to follow her.
I'll catch up to her first.

 
**Geronimo:**
I will accompany Fujimaru. Like she said,
I can sense some lingering remnants around here.

 
**Geronimo:**
However, they pose no threat to humanity even if left alone, and would eventually perish on their own...

 
**Geronimo:**
...Hmmm, Singularity, huh?

 
**Mash:**
Ugh... These are...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, well. This is just terrible.

 
**Geronimo:**
A group of vengeful spirits.
But this is...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You can sense it as Servants, can't you. There's nothing you can do about the rage they're feeling.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
If left alone, they will eventually pose a threat.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Come, Fujimaru.
Time for exorcism.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Steel your heart.
It's time to fight.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Cú Chulainn:**
Ugh, this whole experience is leaving a bad taste in my mouth. No wonder Billy bailed.

 
**Geronimo:**
...This spirit...
Jeanne Alter.

 
**Geronimo:**
Is this your redemption? To deal a finishing blow?
Or are you looking for something else?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Nothing like that.
I just want closure, and to wipe my slate clean.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
After all, the previous me left this mess behind.

 
**Geronimo:**
So it's your conscience.
You should really learn how to let go.

 
**Geronimo:**
At the very least, this fixation of yours is unnecessary for this journey of restoring Humanity.

 
**Geronimo:**
Any one of us could've been summoned by the other side.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Proper Heroic Spirits like you can say that.
I can't.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
To me, the biggest regret I left behind was...me.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Um... Master.
What do we do now?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Sure, these vengeful spirits might be harmful to the people here if left alone, but would they pose a threat to humanity as a whole? No.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
The worst they can do is eat a few animals or the odd person here and there. But the way things are looking, no human wants to get anywhere near here.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
From what I can tell, there's not a living person left in that nearby town anywa&ndash;

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go help her.


---
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...That's what I thought.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
But, a job without compensation won't do morale any favors...

 
**Geronimo:**
Oh that reminds me, Billy told me he'd forget about all the money you owe him if you do this.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Geronimo, are you serious!?
Okay, now I'm motivated!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Hmph. As long as you're on board, I couldn't give less of a shit about your motive.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Let's head into town, Fujimaru.
I mean, Master.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Got it?


**--ARROW--:**

**Mash:**
...Just like Cú Chulainn said...there's no one here.

 
**Geronimo:**
Wrong, something is definitely here.
I'm sure you've picked up the readings as well.

 
**Mash:**
...Yes, the only living creature there is the Master.
All the other entities I'm picking up are spirits.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
No surprise there. This town was destroyed a long time ago. Even if the world has repaired itself, even if its citizens are revived...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
The only thing Humanity repairs is history. The hatred and despair engraved on this timeline will never fade away.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It's simple. Hatred and despair die hard.
Anything could cause those remnants to resurface.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's why we must crush them first.
Do you follow?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Now, the next wave of enemies is coming.
Are you ready?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ready.
 
**Geronimo:**
...Master, just in case.

 
**Geronimo:**
She's not asking if you're ready to put your life on the line for this upcoming battle.

 
**Geronimo:**
She's asking if you're capable of exterminating those spirits. They might become evil in the future, but right now, they're still innocent.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course I am.
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Hmph, I wonder if you really are.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What if I told you those spirits are still innocent?
Would you still say you're ready to put them down?

 


---
 
**Geronimo:**
Anyway, more enemies are coming!
Get ready!

 
**Ghost:**
It hurts... It hurts... Hot... Suffocating...

 
**Ghost:**
Help... Help...
I don't... I don't want to die...

 
**Ghost:**
Die... Won't die... Death... I am dead...
Kill me... I will kill you...

 
**Ghost:**
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.

 
**Ghost:**
I WILL KILL ALL OF YOU.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...Master, please keep it together! If you show any weakness, those ghost will possess you and kill you!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
They don't even know who they should hate anymore.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
If other people were to visit this town during the course of Humanity restoring itself, they would be possessed and slaughtered.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...If you want to stop that from happening, you have to exorcise every ghost here.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
However, they have not sinned, and they don't deserve any punishment. But it would be too late for them once their hate finally manifested.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm sure salvation is still possible for these poor souls since they haven't killed anyone.

 
**Geronimo:**
...Fujimaru, I'm sure you've realized by now...the source of such a grudge, such hatred in innocent spirits...

 
**Geronimo:**
Jeanne Alter, who brought you here.
She is the source.

 
**Geronimo:**
More specifically, the Jeanne Alter of this Singularity.

 
**Mash:**
...So these are ghosts of those who died in the Hundred Years' War of Evil Dragons?

 
**Geronimo:**
Naturally. The Jeanne Alter responsible for that crime has already been defeated.

 
**Geronimo:**
There's no reason to force the newly summoned Jeanne Alter to atone for the sins of her old self.

 
**Geronimo:**
But then...
Why did she manifest as an Avenger?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Now I understand what you're trying to say, Geronimo.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Does the fallen maiden have the intention of fulfilling her duty as a Servant to help restore Humanity?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
If not, she's unfit to be Fujimaru's Servant.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
She would just be a crazed woman who uses her status as a Servant to satisfy her own twisted desires.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
The real question is...
Which one are you?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...More than anyone, that's what I want to know;
it's why I'm here right now.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But for the most part, it's what I expected.

 
**Mash:**
...What do you mean?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I thought that I'd at least enjoy taking my revenge.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
But if I'm being honest... I'm not enjoying this at all.
It's actually boring me out of my skull.

 
**Geronimo:**
...I see, that's good.
Indeed, nothing fun comes from vengeance.

 
**Geronimo:**
However, exorcising these poor souls will not bring you salvation either.

 
**Geronimo:**
So, why? Why do you persist?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
What do I need salvation for?
I'm just a fleeting dream.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Even if I pour everything I have into that effort, I will leave nothing behind. And that's fine. That's just the hand I was dealt.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm not here to atone for my sins, nor am I here to seek salvation. I'm here for one purpose and one purpose only: to bring you victory.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That...is the one thing I won't forget.
I can never forget.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...Heh.

 
**Geronimo:**
...Hah.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...That's right.
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Humph.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Did you get what I said!? Are you just pretending to be an idiot or are you actually that dumb!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you.
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Psh, whatever.
Not like I need your stupid thanks!

 


---
 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Now, we just need to clean up the castle.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
We already got this far.
We'll stick with you until the end.

 
**Geronimo:**
Indeed. However, I want you to show us the conclusion you've reached.

 
**Geronimo:**
Not just your conclusion, but what led you to it as well.

 
**Ghost:**
...Ughhh. Why...why...!
I...am...ah...ahhhhhhh...

 
**Ghost:**
Kill... I must kill... I must...protect...

 
**Ghost:**
God...
Why would you forsake us...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
It feels terrible in here. Come forth, restless dead who can only lament your own tragedy!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Come at me! I am standing right here!
Don't just bitch and whine! Fight me!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You who were powerless in life! Come on!
Fight me! Kill me! Punish me for my sins!

 
**Mash:**
...U-ummm... Jeanne Alter?
What are you trying to do?

 
**Ghost:**
You... Yooouuu! Curse you... Curse you curse you curse you curse you curse you curse you curse yooouuu!

 
**Ghost:**
DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Fool, look what you've done!
They're fusing together!

 
**Geronimo:**
...That monster is the sum of all the hatred they bear her. But this is... I see...

 
**Geronimo:**
So...HE was the one you were really hoping to find salvation for... No, that's better left unsaid.

 
**--BATTLE--:**

**Ghost:**
...You...
How...did...you...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I see you somehow managed to keep you consciousness... Charles VII.

 
**Mash:**
...!

 
**Ghost:**
Jeanne... To think...you would...kill...the innocent...civilians...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I did. That's right.
And now I'm going to kill them again.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I won't let anyone&ndash;not some big damn noble hero, or a loser antiherotake this from me.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I killed you, I killed your followers,
I killed the civilians, I killed them all.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm not here to make excuses. I'm not here for salvation. I'm not here for punishment. This isn't FUN for me.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
I'm just fulfilling my duty as a Servant!

 
**Ghost:**
Duty... I see...
So you are calling this your...duty...

 
**Ghost:**
We will hate you, and forever curse you.
Yet there's no hatred in your heart?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Master, do you know?

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Charles VII, the one you know from the history books...

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
He ordered a retrial for me&ndash;no, for Jeanne d'Arc&ndash;
eighteen years after her death.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
He testified to her innocence, her honesty,
and her bravery on the battlefield.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Due to his testimony, among many others,
the original sentence was overturned.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Maybe he wanted to make amends.
Or maybe he just did it to ease his own conscience.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Or maybe, he did it hoping to save Jeanne... But once you're dead, you're just lost in the endless abyss.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, not that knowing his motive would make a difference to your life.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Knowing you, you probably don't even care to find out.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
You're right.
I don't know, and I don't give a rat's ass.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
If anything, the other me would be happy that...
No, she wouldn't care, either.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
She's not the sort to worry about her reputation after her death. Actually, she didn't seem to care even while she was alive.

 
**Geronimo:**
How it happened doesn't matter. What matters is that this incident has been resolved the way it should.

 
**Geronimo:**
What's more, you didn't let anyone else do this for you, easy as it would have been to do so.

 
**Geronimo:**
The logic behind your resolve, your dignity...
Those are what makes you a Servant.

 
**Geronimo:**
Jeanne Alter, by your actions you have proven yourself to be a just and proper Servant.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Jeanne Alter really is a great Servant!

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Hmph.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
...Now this farce is over.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Time to get on with restoring Humanity.
Say your goodbyes to this hellhole.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
Don't worry, death has been wiped away from this land. One day, life will flourish here once again, even though my sin will forever stain this place.

 
**Jeanne Alter:**
That's just the way things should be.
