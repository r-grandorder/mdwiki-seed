# Eric Bloodaxe

## Terror of the Bloodaxe

**Eric:**
Uuhnn...

 
**Mash:**
...Eric?
What's the matter?

 
**Eric:**
Uuuuuunnn!
Uhn...Gah...Guh...Ghnn!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?
Fou, fou, fou!

 
**Eric:**
Ghnn&ndash;!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
S-Stand back, everyone!
Eric is a Berserker!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
He could go on a rampage!
Fujimaru and Mash, get away from him!

 
**Mash:**
Eric!

 
**Eric:**
...

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Eric:**
...Y-You scum... You scoundrels... Are you the ones... who use my husband...for your ends?

 
**Mash:**
What?

 
**Eric:**
My name is Gunnhild. Normally, I would make you pay with your lives for the insolence of summoning my husband with your Holy Grail&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
G-Gunnhild!
Eric Bloodaxe's wife?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If I'm not mistaken, she used witchcraft to put a deadly curse on his enemies. Even after her death, she continues to fight for him...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
B-But how is she contacting us?
And from where?

 
**Eric:**
But I understand your situation.
This time I shall permit you to use my husband.

 
**Eric:**
However, my husband is unable to fully unleash his power. That's because of his weapon, the Bloodaxe.

 
**Eric:**
This is the blood-stained axe formed out of the flesh and blood of demonic beasts.

 
**Eric:**
When allowed to drink the blood of several demonic beasts, its true power will be unleashed.

 
**Mash:**
Demonic...beasts?
But, where would we find...

 
**Eric:**
Fear not.
I will "summon" them now.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm picking up several lifeforms!
Prepare for battle!

 
**Mash:**
Th-This is outrageous...

 
**Eric:**
Yeeeaaaarrrgh...
Kill...demonic...beasts!

 
**Mash:**
H-Here they come!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Whew...

 
**Eric:**
Demonic...beasts...blood...bloood!

 
**Mash:**
The axe is...drinking their blood...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
The axe's magical energy level is rising.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I see. So it wasn't a bluff when she said its power wasn't fully unleashed.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I've detected two more lifeforms.
Please keep heading toward the forest.

 
**Mash:**
Understood.
Eric, let's go.

 
**Eric:**
Fu...
Fuuuuu...

 
**Fou:**
Fou!
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Fou is warning us about something.
There are traces of a large beast moving through here.

 
**Mash:**
There are large marks like something was dragged.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A snake?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
An alligator?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Either way, it's huge.
Let's go after it.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Eric:**
...Hnnnng...axe...blood...
I want blood, blood, blood!

 
**Mash:**
C-Control yourself!

 
**Mash:**
Here they come!
They're&mdash;Lamias!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...Whew.
Somehow we got through that.

 
**Eric:**
Heheheheheh...blood...blood!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hmm, this is what we call "viewer discretion advised"
...All right, this is the last one.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's on the other side of the forest, but it hasn't moved. Its lifeform reading is the most powerful of all. You need to be careful.

 
**Eric:**
Hahahah...It's there...I know it's there!
Demonic...beast!

 
**Mash:**
...There it is!
That's...no way...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
A Chimera...the legendary beast with the heads of a lion and a ram, and the tail of a snake!

 
**Mash:**
What's more, it's considered to be a high-ranking demonic beast! Even from here I can sense its overpowering desire to kill...

 
**Eric:**
Master...Let's go...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Forward, Eric!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Kill!
 


---
 
**Eric:**
Your... Blood... Is... Mine!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Eric:**
Hyahahahahah! Take that!
Take that! Take that!

 
**Eric:**
Your blood...your flesh...everything...is mine!

 
**Mash:**
The axe...has started to glow ominously.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ahh, now I see. What an overwhelming amount of magical energy. This is that axe's true form.

 
**Eric:**
Master...
I look forward...to serving you more...Heheheheheh!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Gee, well...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...We certainly seem to have awakened one monstrous Servant.

 
**Mash:**
As long as you can control it Master, there's no problem... Right?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
L-Leave it to me.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-I'll do what I can.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...That's not very reassuring Master.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!
