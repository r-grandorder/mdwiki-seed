# Artoria Pendragon - Lancer Alter

## Unwakeable Dream, Unending War

**Mash:**
Is this a&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
battlefield?
But from what era?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh? What?
Where are you guys?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Right here.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It looks like some battlefield?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You've got all your arms and legs, right?
Yeah, the both of you have proper vitals...

 
**Mash:**
I'm not sure what's going on, either.
Doctor, how's it going on your end?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Let's see. According to my observations...
You haven't made it to the Rayshift coordinates.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It looks like something interfered with the Rayshift process. Hmm...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, not interfered...
If I were to phrase it properly&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Like Fujimaru was pulled somewhere suddenly, willingly?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What? Really?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I really don't remember that.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Wait a second, Senpai.
There's someone over there, at twelve o'clock.

 
**Altria:**
...Master?

 
**Mash:**
Lancer... Altria, right?
Senpai, did you summon her?

 
**Altria:**
I don't have time to talk.
They're coming.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm picking up something moving towards you!
Judging by their momentum, they probably think you're enemies!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No choice. Get ready for battle!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes, Master! They're human troops without any magical energy reaction, so&ndash;

 
**Altria:**
Don't hold back.
Take them all down.

 
**Mash:**
B-But we're up against&ndash;

 
**Altria:**
...Here they come. Get ready.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
Battle complete.
Hostile forces...have, uh, been eliminated? What's...

 
**Altria:**
This is my battlefield.
Though it might've been altered in this dream.

 
**Altria:**
I wanted to make use of my lance, as much as possible,
so I asked Master something I shouldn't have.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You did?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't remember.
 


---
 
**Altria:**
I got permission from you subconsciously.
Sorry about that.

 
**Altria:**
My special characteristics as a Servant are what brought this about, I imagine.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Characteristics? Like a Reality Marble of some sort?
But she doesn't have that kind of Noble Phantasm...

 
**Altria:**
This inquiry bores me.
Now&ndash;

 
**Altria:**
Let's fight.
All the easy ones are done with.

 
**Mash:**
...A magical energy reading! I remember this feeling...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I have something closely resembling its values on record!
No doubt about it, this has to be her other self!

 
**Altria?:**
&mdash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
&ndash;There's another of her with a Holy Lance Rhongomyniad?! W-What's with double Rhongomyniads!?

 
**Altria:**
How interesting.
The only one good enough for me is myself.

 
**Altria:**
Let's go, Master.
At any rate, if we don't defeat her, you can't return.

 
**Mash:**
!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Guess we have no choice.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash, get ready for battle!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...Yes, Master.
Starting combat with the enemy Servant.

 
**Altria:**
It smells of battle. Yes. I can't be satisfied by just taking out weak opponents.

 
**Altria:**
A warrior that fights with all they have.
That is my desired opponent&ndash;


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
...W-We managed to take her out.
The battle is over...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Whew... So it's over...
I worked up a sweat just watching.

 
**Altria:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Altria?

 
**Altria:**
...Hmm.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Maybe you wanted to fight by yourself?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Maybe we shouldn't have interfered?
 


---
 
**Altria:**
No&ndash;
I am your Servant, nothing more.

 
**Altria:**
My strength includes yours.
I don't really consider this fight one-vs-many and unfair.

 
**Altria:**
...Though questions remain, so I can't say that I'm satisfied. But that was good enough for now.

 
**Altria:**
In any event, let's get back to your fight.

 
**Altria:**
Give me a good battlefield to fight on,
Master.
