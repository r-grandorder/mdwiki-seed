# Hassan of the Cursed Arm

## Old Man of the Mountain

**Mash:**
A...kidnapper?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well, there have been many incidents of child abduction in this town recently.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So a request for an investigation came to us from Emperor Nero.

 
**Mash:**
I see.
In that case, I am willing to offer my cooperation.

 
**Mash:**
By the way, have you found any clues?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's a quite cunning group so the Emperor's men haven't been able to track them.

 
**Mash:**
If we don't know the location of their base, then there's not much we can do...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So, that's why you were selected among many, Fujimaru.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We have a professional in that field.
It's up to you, "Old Man of the Mountain."

 
**Hassan:**
&ndash;Hassan-i Sabbah, reporting.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ohh, you're here already!?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yup. Greetings.
 


---
 
**Hassan:**
&ndash;Master, I've already tracked them down.
No matter how cunning they are in covering their tracks,

 
**Hassan:**
they can't trick the eyes of the Assassin class Heroic Spirits.

 
**Mash:**
Excellent. I'm worried about the children, Senpai!
Let's hurry!!

 
**Kidnapper:**
What!?
How'd you bastards find us here!?

 
**Hassan:**
&ndash;Ha! You're a joke.
Confidence in that level of hiding...

 
**Hassan:**
You're third-rate bandits at best.
Get a life, or change your ways right here.

 
**Hassan:**
Lucky for you, this Master is kind.
Surrender and you won't be hurt.

 
**Kidnapper:**
Huh. Don't be cocky, bonehead!
Get them, guys!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
I neutralized the enemy group, Master.
I will tie them up on this tree.

 
**Hassan:**
I don't see any children...Their headquarters is somewhere else?

 
**Hassan:**
I will guide you there, Master.
The cornered enemy may be dangerous.

 
**Hassan:**
&ndash;Hurry!

 
**Children:**
Wahhhh...I want to go home...

 
**Kidnapper:**
Hey, walk straight, stupid brats!!
You better stop crying!

 
**Kidnapper:**
What's the problem? We're gonna feed all you hungry rascals that have nothing to live on.

 
**Kidnapper:**
Let's do the best to get along, huh?
I'll raise you all to be proper assassins!

 
**Hassan:**
&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
That's enough!!
Free the children!!

 
**Kidnapper:**
Damn!! Don't get cocky!!
Slaughter them all!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Mash:**
The bandits have been routed.
You are the only one left. Please surrender.

 
**Kidnapper:**
D-Damn!! In that case...!
Hey, can't you see this right here!?

 
**Child:**
Waaaaaah!!

 
**Mash:**
Hostage!?
How foul...!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Despicable!!
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How could you!!
 


---
 
**Kidnapper:**
Oh, shout as you please!!
See ya...!! Hey!! Let's go!!

 
**Kidnapper:**
What!?
The torch is out...!?

 
**Hassan:**
"Zabaniya"

 
**Kidnapper:**
Wha!?
G-Gah...

 
**Hassan:**
Foolish. All too foolish. I do not mean using a child as a shield, or kidnapping children.

 
**Hassan:**
Nothing is as foolish as the one who cannot even measure talent trying to raise an assassin.

 
**Hassan:**
That child is unfit to be a killer.
Such incompetence bringing children to this place&mdash;

 
**Hassan:**
You are no longer worthy of living.
Disappear into the eternal darkness.

 
**Mash:**
Hassan!!

 
**Child:**
Wahhhh!!
That was scary...!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There, there. That was scary.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Uncle Hassan rescued you.
 


---
 
**Child:**
...Mister?

 
**Hassan:**
&mdash;
Mission accomplished, Master. So I will depart now.

 
**Mash:**
Hassan...Was he a bit reluctant about the request this time...?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Well, in a way he's a Servant toosimilar with those bandits just now...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Our idea of helping people and his idea of helping people may perhaps be different.

 
**Child:**
...Um, Miss.Are you friends with that mister just now?

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes.He's like a...friend.

 
**Child:**
Then, give him my thanks.
Tell him thank you, white-faced mister.

 
**Child:**
I don't know how to describe it but that guy...seemed to be really, really angry for me...

 
**Mash:**
&mdash;Sure, got it.
I will definitely tell him.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, Fujimaru, Emperor Nero wanted to express her thanks for the other day. I'll put her through.

 
**Nero:**
Ohhh!! Fujimaru!!
You did great the other day. Praiseworthy!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well, Hassan...Hassan?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's all thanks to Hassan.
 


---
 
**Nero:**
Umu, this Hassan fellow has been really helpful!!

 
**Nero:**
Since then, he's been catching bandits and kidnappers for me every day.

 
**Nero:**
Thanks to him, the crime rate of my beloved Rome has bottomed out!! I'm thrilled!!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Huh!?
Every day since then...?

 
**Mash:**
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Hassan since then.
Perhaps he's been hunting criminals...!?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Beats me, you know...
Maybe Hassan is a good guy at heart...?
