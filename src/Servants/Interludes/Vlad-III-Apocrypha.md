# Vlad III - Apocrypha

## Legend of Dracula I

**Vlad III:**
History is a cloth woven from truth and dreams.
At times the truth is too brutal, so we paint over it with our dreams.

 
**Vlad III:**
...However, there are those who embrace delusions.
They crush the truth, and delight us with deception.

 
**Vlad III:**
&ndash;That is to say, to be frank, I will not forgive "Dracula."
Not ever.

 
**Vlad III:**
&ndash;Are you awake?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's happening now?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Has something happened?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I-I'm sorry, Master.
I know it's late.

 
**Mash:**
But Vlad has something he wants to talk to you about.

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Vlad III:**
&ndash;It's mixed.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mixed?
 


---
 
**Vlad III:**
My memories. You see, I was born the second son of my father, Vlad II, and was ruler of Wallachia.

 
**Vlad III:**
Although I was driven to misfortune, I have no regrets over my life.

 
**Vlad III:**
However&ndash;since my materialization as a Servant,
I have been haunted by a different memory.

 
**Mash:**
Could those be of&ndash;Dracu...

 
**Vlad III:**
&ndash;

 
**Mash:**
...I apologize.
Please continue your story.

 
**Vlad III:**
You're right. The memories of that dreaded vampire.
People I've never seen before glare at me, and try to drive a stake through my heart.

 
**Vlad III:**
...The hearts of men! They are full of absurd naivety and incorrigible stubbornness.

 
**Vlad III:**
They affix imaginary personalities, imaginary histories, and imaginary stories to reality.

 
**Vlad III:**
But they have no idea how much trouble those affected are going through. Therefore, heed my orders.

 
**Vlad III:**
Travel with me to a different era, and eliminate the imaginary history. &ndash;It should be easy.

 
**Vlad III:**
Even imaginings are based on real tales, and those tales have authors.

 
**Vlad III:**
We will bring an end to them. It should be easy for us.
&ndash;Don't tell me, you're going to say no?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Of course not.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...W-Well, that's right.
Defamation is a problem that can't be ignored.

 
**Mash:**
Regardless of the outcome, or how we arrived at it...
Revealing the truth is the right thing to do.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You think we can?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes. At least I think so.

 
**Mash:**
Once we start tracking Dra...'s footsteps, the place with the highest magical energy response...

 
**Mash:**
...will most likely be the origin of Dra...'s legends.

 
**Mash:**
It's just that... Can the commonly known legend of Dra... be erased that easily?

 
**Vlad III:**
Why are you still talking?
I gave you an order. Hurry and make haste.

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes, sir.
All right, let's get going.

 
**Mash:**
We're in London.
We're picking up a strong magical energy response here.

 
**Mash:**
...Most likely, the biggest difference between the original Vlad and the vampire Vlad is whether he visited London or not.

 
**Mash:**
Normally, Vlad has no connection with this place whatsoever.

 
**Vlad III:**
&ndash;So, this is London. I see.
What a dreadful place.

 
**Mash:**
Naturally, Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra never actually existed.

 
**Mash:**
However, it's possible there were actual women being attacked, and having their blood sucked&ndash; Women who resembled the characters.

 
**Vlad III:**
Fine.
Commence your investigation.

 
**Mash:**
Y-Yes, sir.

 
**Mash:**
But we have no clues at all.
Doctor, do you have anything on your end?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Well... I have picked up several small traces of magical energy.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But it's hard to say if those are powerful enough to establish the legend of Dracula.

 
**Vlad III:**
Hmm...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But I'll keep trying!

 
**Vlad III:**
&ndash;No, that's fine. I'm well aware of your devotion to this task. However, it vexes me that there's nothing I can do.

 
**Vlad III:**
It's true that later generations would brand me a tyrant for my reign.

 
**Vlad III:**
However&ndash;even so, I am sure it wasn't enough for people to start calling me Dracul.

 
**Mash:**
Vlad...

 
**Mash:**
What?

 
**Vlad III:**
That was&ndash;the cry of a woman!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I picked up a strong magical energy response.
Mash, you should go take a look.

 
**Vlad III:**
I will accompany you.
Right&ndash;I hope we run into this vampire.

 
**Woman:**
Please...stop...

 
**Vlad III:**
&ndash;"Kazikli Bey."

 
**Woman:**
What?

 
**Vlad III:**
...I see. This is quite intriguing.
Look, Mash and my Master!

 
**Vlad III:**
Completely unfitting for this era, for this place&ndash;
On appearance alone, this is indeed "Dracul."

 
**Mash:**
This is...

 
**Vlad III:**
A monster that transforms into a bat,
and preys on human flesh&ndash; Truly despicable.

 
**Vlad III:**
Prepare for your death, you heinous bat. In my current rage, I don't care if you're the Devil himself... I'll crush you.

 
**Mash:**
That sound just now...

 
**Vlad III:**
It looks like he's calling his allies. Fine. Saves me the trouble of hunting them down. How efficient.

 
**Vlad III:**
Oh how I wish every war was like this.
Wouldn't you agree, Master?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You are absolutely right.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Let's crush them all right here.
 


---
 
**Vlad III:**
I couldn't agree more, Master!

 
**Vlad III:**
Let the devastation commence!
Otherwise&ndash;show us just how much of a devil you are!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Vlad III:**
Hmph. Perish without a trace, you filthy beasts.

 
**Woman:**
...

 
**Vlad III:**
You, girl.

 
**Woman:**
Y-Yes?

 
**Vlad III:**
Worry not. This beast shall no longer trouble you.
Return to your home, and indulge in peaceful slumber.

 
**Woman:**
Y-Yes, sir.
Pardon me&ndash; What is your name, sir?

 
**Vlad III:**
Vlad III. Remember it.

 
**Vlad III:**
Hmm. I believe it's safe to assume the history has returned to its proper path.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Ah, yes.
I think&ndash;this will do the trick.

 
**Vlad III:**
Magnificent!
Then let us return.

 
**Vlad III:**
Sorry for forcing you to accompany me.

 
**Mash:**
N-No, not at all.
It's quite all right.

 
**Vlad III:**
Yes. Tonight you should rest as much as you like.
I will be in my spirit form.

 
**Mash:**
Excuse me, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
...Even if we correct history,
the chance for the legend of Dracula to be erased is...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pretty low?
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Almost none at all?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
...Yes.

 
**Mash:**
But, for Vlad&ndash;this IS his wish for the Holy Grail.

 
**Mash:**
Who knows what might actually happen?

 
**Mash:**
But at the very least, people's perception of Vlad III might change&ndash; That would be a miracle.

 
**Mash:**
All we can do now is hope and watch.


## Legend of Dracula II

**Vlad III:**
Hm... London again? We've already taken care of that devil... Is there something else?

 
**Mash:**
I'm not sure, but we picked up something in in the area.

 
**Vlad III:**
Perfect, then! Even the defeat of a small foe would be a worthy addition to my legend!

 
**Vlad III:**
My name remains infamous, but I shall not be known as demonic nor as vampiric.

 
**Vlad III:**
Very well. Let's go, Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do our best!


---
 
**Vlad III:**
...Ah. It seems we've found it. It seems our foe is a mere wraith this time, rather than a devil.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, but that doesn't mean it is not malicious.
The Demonic Fog still seems to be lingering in the city.

 
**Mash:**
It may normally be “just a wraith,” but right now it's a deadly evil spirit.

 
**Woman:**
Heeelp...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's go rescue her!


---
 
**Vlad III:**
Oh, I know. I shall do what I did before: Kazikli Bey!

 
**Woman:**
Wh-what!?

 
**Vlad III:**
Woman. Stand back.

 
**Vlad III:**
That creature has crept into your world, but it is a being that should not exist.

 
**Vlad III:**
Touch it and you will die.
If you value your life, leave!

 
**Woman:**
B-but, but...I can't...move...!

 
**Vlad III:**
Oh... Then I have no choice.
Master, stay back and protect her.

 
**Vlad III:**
I shall impale that wraith.
Normally, my stakes are reserved for punishment...

 
**Vlad III:**
To threaten to harm civilians even after death... Unforgivable! I shall destroy you!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Vlad III:**
Vanished like the mist. How petty.

 
**Vlad III:**
But with the Singularity gone, how could there be a problem with evil spirits...?

 
**Vlad III:**
I suppose I should expect as much from a demonic city like London...

 
**Woman:**
U-um. Thank...you...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Get home safe.


---
 
**Woman:**
Thank you very much...!

 
**Vlad III:**
...Wait.

 
**Woman:**
Y-yes?

 
**Vlad III:**
My name is Vlad III. Remember it, keep it within your heart, and live the rest of your life to your fullest.

 
**Vlad III:**
And listen.

 
**Vlad III:**
Some of the things I do may seem odd, but I am in no way related to vampires.

 
**Vlad III:**
Understood?

 
**Vlad III:**
UNDERSTOOD?

 
**Woman:**
Y-yes!

 
**Vlad III:**
...Hm. Now at least that woman will never think of me as a vampire.

 
**Vlad III:**
Well, let's continue.
Mash Kyrielight, have you found anything?

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes... In the northern part of the city, there is a response very similar to the devil we just saw.

 
**Mash:**
However, just like last time, it is a weak response.

 
**Mash:**
...This is just speculation, but there is a high possibility that it's a Demonic Beast that we're just assuming is a devil.

 
**Mash:**
It's likely here because of the residual Demonic Fog still in the area.

 
**Vlad III:**
Or perhaps it was summoned for some purpose related to magecraft.

 
**Mash:**
This is... Could this be a summoning circle of some sort?

 
**Man:**
A monster!
Monster!!!

 
**Man:**
Get to safety now!
Hey, you too...!

 
**Man:**
It's surely the devil!

 
**Vlad III:**
Ah. So this is the devil.
Laughable. It's no more than a beast gone mad.

 
**Man:**
H-hey, you...!?

 
**Vlad III:**
I shall quite literally rip you to shreds!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Vlad III:**
What trifling nuisances.
Such pathetic opponents may even weaken my spear.

 
**Man:**
Wh-who the hell are you?

 
**Vlad III:**
Ah. You ask my name.
Then I shall answer.

 
**Vlad III:**
My name is Vlad Tepes.
You there, repeat it...

 
**Man:**
U-um...Vlad Tepes?

 
**Vlad III:**
Correct. If it's hard to say, you may simply call me Vlad III. Either way, there's one very important thing you must remember.

 
**Vlad III:**
Listen well: Vlad III is NOT a vampire.

 
**Vlad III:**
Repeat!!!

 
**Man:**
Vlad III is not...a vampire?

 
**Vlad III:**
Very good!


**--ARROW--:**

**Vlad III:**
Now all that's left is the mage.
I will not ask him to come to me.

 
**Vlad III:**
No...I'll chase him round perdition's flames before I give him up. I shall show them what it is to be Lord Impaler.

 
**Mage:**
...Wh-who the hell are you guys?

 
**Vlad III:**
You do not know me?
I am Vlad Tepes&ndash;

 
**Mage:**
Vlad III...of Wallachia? You lie.
Lord Vlad perished long ago!

 
**Vlad III:**
Yes, that is correct.
I fought and died as the ruler of Wallachia.

 
**Vlad III:**
What is done is done. The story of my life has been swallowed in the annals of history. However, I will not tolerate anyone who glosses over the truth in later years.

 
**Mage:**
...What are you talking about?

 
**Vlad III:**
There's no need for you to know.
After all, I'm going to destroy you.

 
**Mage:**
Ack! N-no!
Summon...I summon thee! Come forth! Save me!

 
**Mage:**
Help me...!!!  
 
**Mash:**
A summoning circle...!
Is he trying to summon something again!?

 
**Mage:**
Ahhh! It's here... It's here!
Kill them! Kill them all...!

 
**Vlad III:**
...Now what has he summoned this time?

 
**Mash:**
This's a super giant organism reaction... Could it be...!?

 
**Mash:**
Did he manage to summon...a dragon to the 19th century...?

 
**Vlad III:**
There's no need to be surprised.

 
**Vlad III:**
The seven eras had stood once under fire. If they are undergoing repairs, it wouldn't be surprising something like this can happen.

 
**Mage:**
Y-yes... I did it! My clan's ambitions have finally been fulfilled!

 
**Mage:**
Using this dragonkin, I shall bring all of London's mages under my command!

 
**Mage:**
Now all the Lords of the Clock Tower will be erad&mdash;

 
**Mage:**
...Huh?

 
**Mash:**
The mage...!

 
**Mage:**
Gyaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!
It's... IT'S EATING MEEEEEE!!!

 
**Mage:**
Why!? I was the one who summoned it...! Why!?
Sto&ndash;Gyaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!

 
**Vlad III:**
Pathetic. Only through luck and coincidence did he succeed in his summoning. Without the ability to control his thrall, there is no point summoning it.

 
**Vlad III:**
Fine.
O almighty Phantasmal Beast... Dragonkin!

 
**Vlad III:**
My father revered thy name, and deemed thy form perfect for battle!

 
**Vlad III:**
And as his son, I have been despised by my enemies, by the people, by history itself... Not as a dragon, but as the devil!

 
**Vlad III:**
And now, I shall grapple with thee...a being Father deemed perfection itself. What irony!

 
**Vlad III:**
But I am grateful for this evil fortune! It may be twisted, but I will make a most worthy opponent for you!

 
**Vlad III:**
I, Vlad III, the son of Dracul...shall sink my fangs into your neck!

 
**Mash:**
Dragonkin...incoming!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's do this!
 
**Vlad III:**
Indeed! Taste my deadly spear!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Protect the people of the city!
 
**Vlad III:**
...Yes! How like my Master to be conscious of such a thing, even in a situation like this!

 
**Vlad III:**
If we were in the right era, you might have made a respectable king.

 
**Vlad III:**
Now, let's do this!

 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Vlad III:**
...Impressive, dragonkin. As a creature that possesses part of my name, you truly were a worthy opponent.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's the opposite, my lord.


---
 
**Vlad III:**
...Ahem.

 
**Vlad III:**
I suppose we've managed to improve my name's ill repute here.

 
**Vlad III:**
A mysterious hero who saved London from a dragonkin... Not bad. Not bad at all...

 
**Mash:**
(If it's mysterious, then no one will know it was him...)

 
**Mash:**
...Oh no! A crowd is gathering!

 
**Mash:**
Let's move out! Master, Vlad...hurry!

 
**Man:**
U-um...

 
**Vlad III:**
Hm? What is it?

 
**Man:**
If it's all right...may I take a photograph with you?

 
**Vlad III:**
A photograph? Hm. I'll allow it.
Master. Let's take it together.

 
**Mash:**
Eh!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that... C-can we do that...?
 
**Vlad III:**
I'll allow it.

 
**Vlad III:**
Even that Saint George&ndash;Georgios&ndash;has made a hobby of it. That surely means it is not something that would give offense to God.

 
**Vlad III:**
Master. My collar is not crooked, is it?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-is this okay?
 
**Vlad III:**
Ha... I have knowledge of the modern world. I know very well that such contraptions don't steal one's soul.

 
**Vlad III:**
Pity it will be monochrome, though...

 
**Mash:**
(I think Vlad is missing the point...)

 


---
 
**Man:**
Here we go!

 
**Mash:**
Th-this picture's not going to be left for future generations, is it...?

 
**Vlad III:**
Do not worry. Even if it were, nobody would know what kind of photo it was anyway.

 
**Vlad III:**
It is destined to turn to dust someday, much like that dragonkin we just defeated.

 
**Vlad III:**
Let us return to Chaldea, Master. I appreciate you accompanying me on my endless journey to fulfill my desires.

 
**Vlad III:**
It may be futile. It may all be in vain.
It may be a meaningless and ludicrous journey.

 
**Vlad III:**
But such a thing is not to be fought. It is not in my nature to be abashed.

 
**Vlad III:**
And. While I savor all of these endeavors...

 
**Vlad III:**
I simply cannot take pride in the fact that I am a vampire. Not ever.
