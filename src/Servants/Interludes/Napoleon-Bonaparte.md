# Napoleon Bonaparte
  
## Before and After the Dream
 
**Napoleon:**
Yeah! Got 'em!

 
**Napoleon:**
Guess that takes care of my side of things! All right!
Any of you guys needing cover fire, just say the word!

 
**Arash:**
Haha! Me, needing cover fire?
That's the best joke I've heard all day!

 
**Arash:**
I've got things handled just fine on my end!
'Course, I can't speak for Professor Lightning over&ndash;

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Don't be ridiculous!

 
**Napoleon:**
Oh yeah? Great! Then let's see what you've got!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Raaah! In my right hand, I wield sine wave alternating current! In my left, square wave alternating current! And from my forehead, I send out pulse wave alternating current!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Their powers combined surpass even Thor's hammer, Mjölnir itself! Behold!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Lightning and Thunder Descend!
All Things Bow Before Me!

 
**Mash:**
...All enemy data has vanished. That concludes this training session. Great work, everyone!

 
**Mash:**
Da Vinci's thrilled at having so much cannon, arrow,
lightning, and ice combat data to pore over.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You all did great!
 
**Mash:**
That goes for you too, Senpai!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks for keeping an eye on the data, Mash.
 
**Mash:**
Of course. I'm happy I can be of assistance.

 


---
 
**Nikola Tesla:**
We won! Victory! Is! Ouuurs!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Haha, hahaha, HAHAHAHAHAHA! You know, I may have once said I had no need for magical energy from the Age of Gods...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But it seems I now owe you an apology for that statement, my fair lady. I mean, Your Majesty.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Your elegant guidance helps my lightning to crackle with more power than ever. With this, there is no enemy in the world who can stand before my might!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Well, that may be something of an exaggeration, but I assure you I do not exaggerate in the slightest when I say that your techniques are a sight to behold.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
We may come from very different times and civilizations, but I still hold you in the highest respect, Your Majesty.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Hmm. Is that so?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I-I mean, I have no need for your flattery, Nikola Tesla. Indeed, you should not be so quick to praise anyone so highly.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
You are an acclaimed scholar and Pioneer of the Stars, are you not? Then it is in your nature to carve a path towards the future and to uncover the secrets of Mystics such as myself.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Go ahead and brag as much as you like.
Do not worry about sparing my feelings.

 
**Arash:**
Hahaha, hear that, Professor Lightning?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
...You wound me, Your Majesty. I assure you, when I say I hold you in the highest respect, I mean every word.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Do you now?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Hmm, very well. Then tell me, what do you make of Divine Spirits as a whole?

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Ah yes, well, that is a different story! Indeed, I still have a great many doubts about the very system encompassing Divine Spirits!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Divine Spirits are said to have come from the gods themselves, but they no longer have any control over nature!

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Indeed, unlike in the Age of Gods, even the tiniest exertion of their Authority nowadays is said to cause them to become a Divided Spirit and disappear...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
But if you ask me, I don't see why they should still have any Authority at all, since the gods handed over control of this world to humanity long ago!

 
**Napoleon:**
Hahaha, that's quite the impassioned argument, Nikola Tesla! I can tell you've thought a lot about this subject!

 
**Napoleon:**
But how about we leave it at that for now and pick this up again some other time? I'm sure the goddess must be exhausted after fighting all day, even if it was only training.

 
**Napoleon:**
It might be way more advanced than Maître's, but all that magecraft Enhancement's still gotta wear on her.

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
Hmm...

 
**Nikola Tesla:**
You make a good point.
I apologize for getting carried away.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Way to defuse the situation, Emperor!
 
**Napoleon:**
What can I say? We gunners excel at backing others up.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're a sharp one, aren't you, Napoleon?
 
**Napoleon:**
Hahaha.

 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
I gotta admit though, I get why Tesla'd be all fired up. That goddess's magecraft really is a sight to behold!

 
**Napoleon:**
In fact, let me tell you to your face, Scáthach-Skadi.
You're really something else!

 
**Napoleon:**
Hm?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...
...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...V-very well, that is all for today's training, yes?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Then I think I will go on ahead.
Until next time.

 
**Arash:**
Haha, I guess you're the one who got shot down this time.

 
**Napoleon:**
Guess so! Unfortunately, it seems the goddess of Scandinavia is just as formidable as old General Winter, albeit in a different way.

 
**Napoleon:**
......

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You okay, Napoleon?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Everything okay?
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
Hm?

 
**Napoleon:**
Not quite. I might have to ask for some of your time later, Maître.


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Jack:**
Oh, hi, Uncle.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Good day, Uncle Napoleon. Are you all done playing with Master in the simulator?

 
**Jack:**
Aww, that sounds like fun.
We wish we could've played, too.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
I'll say. No fair. I'm jealous.

 
**Napoleon:**
All right, enough with the poking.
I was just training with some of my fellow Archers.

 
**Napoleon:**
Oh, the goddess from Scandinavia was there too. I don't know if she's a Divine Spirit or a real god or what, but she sure knows how to fight.

 
**Jack:**
Neat.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Scáthach-Skadi is the goddess of snow and the king of a vanished Lostbelt.

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Both her magical energy and her magecraft really are extraordinary, aren't they...

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Oh, good day, Your Majesty.
We were just talking about you.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Hm?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Well now, if it isn't the Heroic Spirits of Humanity who look like children. I know you're excited to play, but you really mustn't run and shout in the halls&ndash;

 
**Napoleon:**
Well, if it isn't the goddess of Scandinavia.
Can't say it's been a particularly long time!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I-indeed.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...
...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...Well, good day.

 
**Napoleon:**
Hm?

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Well, she's clearly avoiding you.
Did you do or say something inappropriate?

 
**Jack:**
Inappropriate...

 
**Napoleon:**
Who, me!?

 
**Napoleon:**
Nah, I'm sure I haven't done anything that might've upset her. Although, she did seem to be avoiding me, didn't she?

 
**Nursery Rhyme:**
Definitely.

 
**Jack:**
Definitely.

 
**Jeanne Alter Santa Lily:**
Definitely!

 
**Napoleon:**
You all think so too, huh?


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Napoleon:**
Hey, there you are.

 
**Napoleon:**
You're just the goddess I've been looking for.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Oh. Hello...

 
**Napoleon:**
So hey, uh, I've been doing my best to be sensitive and careful and stuff, but...

 
**Napoleon:**
...maybe I still did or said something that upset you? Something inappropriate?

 
**Napoleon:**
Anyway, I figured whatever it was, you might not want to talk about it in front of the kids, so I figured this would be a better time for you to speak your mind.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...
...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...It is nothing.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
You did nothing wrong whatsoever, Emperor Bonaparte.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Nor is there any need for you to worry about me,
or to spare my feelings.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
All you need do is live your life as you see fit.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...
...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...That being said...

 
**Napoleon:**
Yeah?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
......

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
No, never mind.
There is nothing more to discuss.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Good day, Emperor Bonaparte.

 
**Napoleon:**
Hmmmmmm...

 
**Napoleon:**
So the goddess ain't talking, huh.

 
**Napoleon:**
Heh. Looks like this is going to be a difficult campaign!

 
**Napoleon:**
But before I commence the operation...
I'd better make sure I'm ready for anything!


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come in.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The door's open!
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
Hey there, Maître.

 
**Napoleon:**
I wanted to talk to you about... Actually, it looks like you've already got a pretty good idea.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I take it this is about Scáthach-Skadi?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Well yeah. I mean, she hasn't quite been herself, has she?
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
You know it.

 
**Napoleon:**
At first I thought I'd done something here to upset her, but it looks like that's not the case.

 
**Napoleon:**
So I figure that just leaves one other possibility.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
I know there's a report and video and stuff. Holmes pulled me aside and told me about it right after I got summoned.

 
**Napoleon:**
I take it it's all true then?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah. We first met you and Scáthach-Skadi in the Scandinavian Lostbelt...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah. This isn't the first time we've all met.
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
That's what I heard!

 
**Napoleon:**
'Course, I don't know any of the details, since I never took a look at the report or video myself.

 
**Napoleon:**
You think that makes me a coldhearted bastard, Maître?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I don't know if I'd put it that way...
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not at all.
 
**Napoleon:**
Thanks. I appreciate that.

 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
...All right, I should probably just tell you what I've been thinking already.

 
**Napoleon:**
First off, let's make sure we're all on the same page.

 
**Napoleon:**
Heroic Spirits don't retain any memories or records of their past summons. They basically show up fresh each time.

 
**Napoleon:**
They might have extremely similar personalities to their other incarnations, but they're still different people.

 
**Napoleon:**
Of course, like any rule, there are some exceptions. A few Heroic Spirits have been known to keep their memories between summons, whether they want to or not.

 
**Napoleon:**
But, I'm not one of them. Me? I'm the sort of Heroic Spirit who puts his heart and soul into each individual materialization.

 
**Napoleon:**
I show up as a ray of pure possibility, and throw myself at the problem at hand with everything I've got.

 
**Napoleon:**
As a result, I always end up literally burning myself out before I even get to the point of inscribing my accomplishments on the Throne.

 
**Napoleon:**
I keep going until I don't have anything left.
That's just the kind of guy I am.

 
**Napoleon:**
Which is why I'm not usually in the habit of picking things up where I left off.

 
**Napoleon:**
Uh, I guess what I'm trying to say is, well...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
As far as you're concerned, what happened in Scandinavia stays in Scandinavia?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Basically, you're not interested in hearing what happened in Scandinavia?
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
Right. But...that only applies as long as I'm the only one affected.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
And that's not the case this time!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And since Scáthach-Skadi was also involved in Scandinavia...!
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
Exactly, Maître. Exactly!

 
**Napoleon:**
I consider myself here and myself in Scandinavia to be completely different people, so I wasn't originally planning to ask what the other me did there...

 
**Napoleon:**
But if that means never knowing why Scáthach-Skadi always looks so sad whenever she sees me, then to hell with it!

 
**Napoleon:**
I see now that I should've never just assumed my other self did everything he could there and left it at that!

 
**Napoleon:**
So, on that note!

 
**Napoleon:**
...I'm here to ask you for a favor, Maître.

 
**Napoleon:**
Tell me what happened in the Scandinavian Lostbelt.
Tell me what it is you saw there.

 
**Napoleon:**
Tell me what it is I did there.
Please. I need to know.

 
**Napoleon:**
I know you're a busy [♂ guy /♀️ gal}, and I'm sorry to impose, but I'm still asking you to set aside this evening for me.

 
**Napoleon:**
In exchange, I promise I'll make it worth your while.
I swear on my honor as Napoleon Bonaparte. No, wait!

 
**Napoleon:**
I swear on the rainbow emblazoned across the sky!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Do you mind if I bring Mash in for this?
 


---

**Napoleon:**
Go for it! Having two people recount what they saw oughta give me an even more complete picture!


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Napoleon:**
...
...

 
**Napoleon:**
......

 
**Napoleon:**
...Ophelia, huh.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Napoleon:**
Weird. I was sure I don't carry over any memories from one summon to the next...

 
**Napoleon:**
...but there's something about that name that just tugs at my heart.

 
**Napoleon:**
Ophelia...
What a beautiful name.

 
**Napoleon:**
...I bet it suited her perfectly.

 
**Napoleon:**
I hope I'm not insulting both her and Joséphine when I say that both their names inspire similar feelings in me...

 
**Mash:**
I... I don't think it's insulting at all.

 
**Napoleon:**
Thank you, mademoiselle.

 
**Napoleon:**
...
...

 
**Napoleon:**
...Ophelia.

 
**Napoleon:**
I see. So I risked my life to save hers...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Napoleon?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Are you okay?
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
Oh sure, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

 
**Napoleon:**
All that aside... Haha, I had no idea you two were already soldiers in my Grande Armée!

 
**Napoleon:**
And you're saying I even awarded you medals!?
Damn, you two must've really impressed me...

 
**Napoleon:**
...
...

 
**Napoleon:**
...Yeah. Now I see it.

 
**Mash:**
I'm sorry, what is it you see?
...Napoleon?

 
**Napoleon:**
Yeah! I can see it clear as day!

 
**Napoleon:**
Now I know exactly what it is I need to shoot down.

 
**Napoleon:**
Turns out there was something I had to do here all along!

 
**Napoleon:**
Private Fujimaru, I need your help!
Consider this an order from your commanding officer!

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Napoleon:**
Watch your step, you two.

 
**Napoleon:**
I like marching through the woods at night as much as the next guy, but there's no denying it majorly slows you down.

 
**Napoleon:**
Then again, it's probably no big deal for you, huh? I'm guessing a goddess like yourself can just take to the skies if the walking gets too rough?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...
...

 
**Napoleon:**
Well, my honorable Grande Armée might not be able to fly, but we can still get around on land just fine.

 
**Napoleon:**
In fact, it's all about the ground game for us. The more land we cover on foot, the more light we bring to every corner of the continent!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...Master.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I am aware that the simulator is capable of,
well, simulating any number of situations...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...but what situation would possibly call for only two Servants? It almost seems as though&ndash;

 
**Napoleon:**
There's nothing strange about it. We're just simulating a scenario where we've suffered some losses and have to make do with reduced numbers.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...
...

 
**Napoleon:**
Goddess?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I was speaking to Master just now, not you.

 
**Napoleon:**
Oh, right. Sorry 'bout that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I just felt like training with the two of you today.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
The situation is, I felt like training with both of you together. That's all.
 


---
 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Is that true?

 
**Napoleon:**
Something wrong?
You sound awfully suspicious.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I...

 
**Napoleon:**
And you're right to be.
Sorry for tricking you.

 
**Napoleon:**
I would've been fine talking to you at Chaldea Base, but you would've just kept running away, wouldn't you?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
You... Do you mean to tell me you dragged Master into this just so you could talk to me?

 
**Napoleon:**
Damn straight I did. No way a conversation like this is happening without Maître around.

 
**Napoleon:**
Frankly, Scáthach-Skadi, former king of the Scandinavian Lostbelt, I think we're overdue for a real heart-to-heart!

 
**Napoleon:**
I don't know all that much about you,
but it looks like you can't say the same about me.

 
**Napoleon:**
So tell me, what was I like when you met me before? I'm guessing I probably wasn't the shy and retiring type, was I?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...No, you were not.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Indeed, you were much the same then as you are now, artilleryman.

 
**Napoleon:**
Artilleryman!

 
**Napoleon:**
Ohoho, so that's your nickname for me, huh!
Gotta say, it fits like a glove!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Surely you jest.

 
**Napoleon:**
Nope, I'm deadly serious. See&ndash;

 
**Napoleon:**
Huh?

 
**Mash:**
I-I'm sorry, Senpai! I made sure to turn off enemy encounters before you went in...

 
**Mash:**
...but then one of Da Vinci's automated scripts turned them back on!

 
**Mash:**
And if that wasn't bad enough, this unusual situation ended up setting the difficulty level to Ultra Hard!

 
**Mash:**
You're about to encounter some very powerful enemies!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ooh la la!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Looks like we've got our work cut out for us!
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
D'accord!

 
**Napoleon:**
All right, I know this is short notice, but would you mind helping a little old French artilleryman out!?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...Hmph. Very well, but you shall owe me one for this.

 
**Napoleon:**
Mais oui, mademoiselle.
All right then, shall we!?

 
**Napoleon:**
Grande Armée, move out!

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Napoleon:**
Cannons, fire!

 
**???:**
...!

 
**Mash:**
All enemy data has vanished, and no reinforcements are forthcoming! That should be all of them!

 
**Napoleon:**
That was supposed to be Ultra Hard?
Ha! Piece of cake!

 
**Napoleon:**
Hahaha, damn, my body feels so light! So this is what it's like to be protected by the Norse Allfather's runes!

 
**Napoleon:**
...This is impressive stuff. Really.

 
**Napoleon:**
Odin must've loved you a whole lot to entrust you with this much power, Scáthach-Skadi.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...

 
**Napoleon:**
No wonder you were known as the bride of the gods. I bet Odin wasn't the only one seeking your hand by any means.

 
**Napoleon:**
I'm guessing Thor and Bragi would've been in the running too. Hell, forget the gods. I wouldn't be surprised if even the giants had thrown their hats in the ring.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
It doesn't matter now. They are gone now. They are all gone. So cease this meaningless diatribe at once.

 
**Napoleon:**
Meaningless? You think?

 
**Napoleon:**
Well, it might not mean much to you coming from a mere human, but I've never been shy with compliments when I think they're richly deserved.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Stop it.

 
**Napoleon:**
I'm not kidding, you know.
I really do think you're beautiful and formidable.

 
**Napoleon:**
I still remember from my emperor days that a good ruler ought to be graceful, powerful, and feared, and that's you to a tee.

 
**Napoleon:**
I've never felt more reassured than I have knowing you're fighting by my side.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Stop it.

 
**Napoleon:**
And besides&ndash;

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Stop. It!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
That is enough!
Shut your accursed mouth already.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
What can you possibly hope to gain by flattering me, artilleryman? Must I remind you that you are already married?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Not to mention...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...Ophelia...

 
**Napoleon:**
Yeah, that's right. I make it a point to love one and only one person every time I materialize.

 
**Napoleon:**
I still haven't made up my mind who it's gonna be this time around, but...

 
**Napoleon:**
Ophelia, you said?

 
**Napoleon:**
Yeah, I hear that's the name of the woman I chose in the Scandinavian Lostbelt.

 
**Napoleon:**
She was a good woman, wasn't she?
I've never seen her myself, of course...

 
**Napoleon:**
...but if I chose her, there's no way she could be anything else.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Ah...

 
**Napoleon:**
So how about it?
Can you tell me what Ophelia was like?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I do not know...

 
**Napoleon:**
I bet she was totally worth risking my life for, wasn't she?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I do not know. I do not...

 
**Napoleon:**
I died in that Lostbelt, right? Something tells me I was pretty satisfied with the way I went out.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I do not know!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
How many times must I tell you!?
I do not know one single solitary thing about you!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
So stop asking me! Stop...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Just stop talking to me!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
There is nothing I wish to discuss with you...
Nothing!

 
**Napoleon:**
Ooh la la! You're a couple of big fellows, aren't you!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jötunn giants!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Did Scáthach-Skadi just summon them!?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Y-yes, Senpai!
I'm monitoring the situation as well!

 
**Mash:**
No question. Those things crawling up out of the ground are definitely Jötnar! I suspect Scáthach-Skadi must have forced the Norse giants to manifest!

 
**Mash:**
The Clock Tower has no record of a successful giant summoning, so I believe she must be using some sort of technique from the Age of Gods!

 
**Napoleon:**
Damn, you're just breaking rules left,
right, and center, aren't you!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I do not wish to kill you,
so I will not take your life.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
However...I have had enough of your ridiculous, incessant prattling!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Napoleon! Battle formation!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Grande Armée, move out!
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
D'accord, Maître!

 
**Napoleon:**
Don't worry! I made this bed myself,
so you can be damn sure I'm gonna lie in it!

 
**F：Napoleon:**
All right then...

 
**F：Napoleon:**
Let's do this emperor-style!

 
**--BATTLE--:**
 
**Napoleon:**
All right, rainbow, you're up!
Show them the possibilities that lay ahead!

 
**Napoleon:**
Stretch as far as the eye can see!

 
**Napoleon:**
Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile!!!

 
**Napoleon:**
...Had enough now, Scáthach-Skadi?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...

 
**Napoleon:**
Those giants were manifestations of your anger, right?
I don't blame you. You have every right to be angry.

 
**Napoleon:**
I know I pushed you to open up even though you didn't want to, and I am sorry about that.

 
**Napoleon:**
So go ahead and call as many giants as you want.
Hit me all you like.

 
**Napoleon:**
If that'll make you feel better,
I'll happily shut up and take it.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You can punch me too if you want.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Me too. But if you have something on your mind, I'd like to hear about it.
 


---
 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
......

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...I do not know.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I do not know what it is I should do.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
You are right, Napoleon, but only about half of it.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I am angry, that much is true... I detest myself for being unable to do anything in my confusion.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I do not, however, hold you to account for that.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Even so, that is only half of what occupies my mind.

 
**Napoleon:**
...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
The dead can never return to life.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
A few of us may be lucky enough to be granted a temporary reprieve from death by way of Chaldea's summoning system...but that is not true resurrection. The fact is, I am still very much dead.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
As are you, Napoleon.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I understand that intellectually...
And yet, I still have memories.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
As a Ghost Liner, I remember everything that happened to the Skadi that died in the Scandinavian Lostbelt!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Everything!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
And so, I am at a loss as to how to handle these feelings. For the thought that fills the other half of my mind is...a desire for things to have gone differently.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Whenever I look at you, I...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I find myself wishing that Ophelia were here instead of me!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I am reminded of her every single time I see your face or hear your voice!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
No... There is not a day that goes by when I do not think of her!


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Ophelia:**
You wished to talk to me about the artilleryman...

 
**Ophelia:**
Napoleon, that is?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Yes, that's right.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I know you do not much care for him now,
but he seems like a good and dependable man to me.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
As you are human, and he a Heroic Spirit,
I am sure you move at different speeds...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
But even he will grow tired and move on if you continue to play hard to get, you know?

 
**Ophelia:**
I'd prefer it that way, really.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Hmph. You're no fun.

 
**Ophelia:**
Your Majesty!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Forgive me. It was not my intention to tease. But you are my beloved child, Ophelia, and so I want you to be happy.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Eventually, it will be time for you to choose a husband. Not today, but in time.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
That day will come once my Scandinavia has defeated the other Lostbelts, and regained its future.

 
**Ophelia:**
...Right.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Ahh, if only we were not on opposing sides.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
If I had summoned that artilleryman as my own subordinate, perhaps then you would be more receptive to his advances...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Ophelia?

 
**Ophelia:**
I-I'm fine.

 
**Ophelia:**
It's just...I'd never considered what it might be like...

 
**Ophelia:**
...if he had been summoned to our side...

 
**Ophelia:**
I-I'm not sure how I should respond to him if that were the case...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
There! Now that is what I was hoping to see!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Hehehehe, I see.
Then I shall have to see if I can make that happen.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Then, once that artilleryman gets here&ndash;

 
<span style="color:red">**Sigurd:**</span>
Hmph. I come in and THIS is what I hear you talking about? What a joke.

 
<span style="color:red">**Sigurd:**</span>
The next time he shows his face here,
I'll chop him in half on the spot. End of story.

 
**Ophelia:**
Sigurd! How dare you show yourself before Her Majesty without announcing your presence!?

 
<span style="color:red">**Sigurd:**</span>
Hehe.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Listen, you two. What if, just for the sake of argument, that artilleryman were to join the ranks of my castle&ndash;

 
**Ophelia:**
C-come on, Scáthach-Skadi, there's no point in talking about that. We both know it could never happen.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What do you have to lose by entertaining a simple hypothetical?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Why, one could argue that my very Lostbelt itself is nothing if not a hypothetical given form.

 
**Ophelia:**
But...!

 
<span style="color:red">**Sigurd:**</span>
Hypothetically, I'd chop him in half on the spot.

 
**Ophelia:**
Sigurd!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Hehe.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Remember, we are speaking in hypotheticals. There is no need to think too hard about it. Ahh, what a delightful thought experiment...


**--SECTION BREAK--:**

**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I... I know you are not the same artilleryman I knew in my Scandinavia, but...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...I still find myself wishing for an opportunity to speak to you, Napoleon.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I cannot help but think about what it would be like if Ophelia were here.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
If she were to see all the many Heroic Spirits enjoying each other's company in Chaldea's cafeteria...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
If she were to lay eyes on a place like this deep within the forest she knows so well...what would she say?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
What sort of expression would she wear?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Would she ever smile again...
like she once did?

 
**Mash:**
...

**Fujimaru 1:**
...
 


---
 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...And not just Ophelia. I find myself thinking of my other beloved children as well.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
The humans who lived out their short lives in my Scandinavia, ten thousand per generation...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
The Valkyries who served under me, believing me to be the Allfather's successor...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
The giants who lost everything they had to the masks they were forced to wear...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
How would they react if they were to see a world unburdened by endless ice and snow?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Those are the sorts of things I find myself thinking about whenever I see your face.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
And above all, I loathe myself for thinking about them when I know all too well that such a thing can never be.

 
**Napoleon:**
Okay. Then let's talk.

 
**Napoleon:**
Go on. Don't hold back.

 
**Napoleon:**
It's okay to share what's on your mind. Know why?

 
**Napoleon:**
Because I'm here.

 
**Napoleon:**
And Maître is here. And Mademoiselle Kyrielight too. Sure, as crazy as things get for us, we may not often have time for this sort of thing, but we do right now.

 
**Napoleon:**
There's nothing wrong with talking about how you're feeling, or mourning what you've lost.

 
**Napoleon:**
I might've been the emperor of France, but I know I still have my share of regrets. Goddess or not, I can't imagine it's any different for you.

 
**Napoleon:**
What I'm trying to say, Scáthach-Skadi, is that nobody's gonna blame you for acting more human.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He's right.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Yeah. There's nothing wrong with reminiscing sometimes.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
I agree with that. In fact, I...

 
**Mash:**
I've actually been wanting to ask you about Ophelia...
for a long, long time.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
......

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
......I see. Yes, you may be right.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
It need not be every day, but, if I may truly be permitted to occasionally reflect on those days, then...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Yes. I would like to talk about them.
I would like to mourn their loss.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
And, above all...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...I would like someone else to remember my children as well.

 
**Napoleon:**
You got it.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Then, in that case...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
You will be joining me for a little “nostalgia trip” immediately, Emperor.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I will tell you all about things you know, things you do not know, and things from my past I know all too well.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I will tell you about my daughter, whose eyes sparkled as beautifully as any gem. I will tell you about all my beloved children from Scandinavia.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...But be warned,
it will not be a brief affair.


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...Oh, is it morning already?

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I must have talked all through the night.
I'm sorry, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Don't be. I'm glad we did this.
 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No worries. We'll have to do this again sometime.
 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Yes... I'd like that.

 
**Napoleon:**
Just don't forget to invite me the next time you take a walk down memory lane.

 
**Mash:**
I-I'd like to be there too, if you don't mind!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...Of course. In fact, I would not take “no” for an answer even if you two wished to decline.

 


---
 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
So, Master, if it is all right with you...

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
...I would also like to invite the Valkyries to join us the next time we get together.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Th-then again, these Valkyries are Heroic Spirits of Proper Human History. Perhaps that would only be an imposition...

 
**Napoleon:**
Who knows? But I can tell you now,
there's only one way to find out!

 
**Napoleon:**
Besides...I can't say for sure, but I get the feeling they're dying to talk with you too.

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
That would be wonderful...
I hope you are right.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, Napoleon?
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
Yeah?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're a good man!
 


---
 
**Napoleon:**
Haha, well of course I am!
Who do you think I am, anyway!?

 
**Napoleon:**
Putting aside what I may or may not have done while I was still alive...

 
**Napoleon:**
As a Heroic Spirit, I just can't leave a crying maiden to fend for herself!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
Wh-who said anything about crying!?
I have not shed so much as a tear!

 
**Scáthach-Skadi:**
I-I mean it, all right!?
Don't you dare get the wrong impression!

 
**Napoleon:**
Haha! Wouldn't dream of it!
