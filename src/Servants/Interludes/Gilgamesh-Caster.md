# Gilgamesh - Caster

## The King's Day Off

**Mash:**
So we have taken you through almost all of Chaldea... What do you think, King Gilgamesh?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Honestly, I'm dumbfounded. Saying this is the group that will save humanity is a bold, bold claim.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Staff morale is at its absolute limit.
Is this meant to be some sort of endurance contest?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Uruk was in better shape after being attacked by Gugalanna than this place is now.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Ah well, I suppose I will retract that. Forget it.
I cannot imagine you wanting to be compared to THAT.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
While I appreciate the wise king's thoughtful criticisms, please understand that we receive no outside help.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
We've operated for an entire year with only Chaldea's own stockpile of supplies. I hope you'll take that into consideration. Besides...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...the difficult battles have almost come to an end. This next one is our last. We just have to keep going a little bit longer.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
That might be fine with you, but know that life goes on even after the King of Mages is defeated.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It is the duty of the commander, who is responsible for the lives of so many others, to always be thinking of the future.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
If you cannot do that, then turn command over to that Heroic Spirit over there.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh, are you talking about me?
Oh, King Gilgamesh, how do you do?

 
**Da Vinci:**
I'm not really one of his defenders, but the acting director is doing a great job.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Chaldea could easily have been utterly destroyed when it lost its director.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But Romani was the one who helped everyone back to their feet. Had I been at the helm, well...

 
**Da Vinci:**
I may have gotten more impressive results, but we would likely have lost more people doing so.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Buuut, I do understand what Gilgamesh is getting at. Romani works too much.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Take some time to rest before our last mission. All jokes aside, the way you're going, you'll end up killing yourself from overwork.

 
**Mash:**
That would be a grave situation indeed!
If the Doctor collapses on us now...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Doctors can't medically examine themselves...
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, I guess there's that bit about practicing what you preach. Don't worry. I don't work THAT much.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I rest whenever I get tired,
and my staff backs me up. Don't worry.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
And we can't ask Ereshkigal for a favor...
 
**Mash:**
No. Since we're in Chaldea, even if his soul leaves his body, we can't ask Ereshkigal to send it back...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Overwork, huh? I think I just felt a chill.
Not that such a concept has any meaning to me...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Ah, but I suppose there's always a chance...
Best to be careful. You too, Romani.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It'll be fine. I don't intend on collapsing anytime soon.
I'll pace myself.

 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
You know, if I'm being honest, King Gilgamesh taking a personal interest in my health is a little bit unnerving, really.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Does that mean...he considers me to be worthy?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fool. The number of humans I consider to be worthy must always remain very small.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
All I am saying is that you are Chaldea's Achilles' heel. Keep that in mind.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
And if you cannot do something even that simple, then I have nothing else to say. I'll send you to the underworld myself.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
H-hey! He's unleashing his Noble Phantasm right here in the Command Room! Even when you get more mature, you're still alarmingly childish!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Now, now. Grow up, both of you.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Why don't you rest for today, since King Gilgamesh is insisting? Fortunately, there's nothing that needs your attention right now.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...(Sigh) I suppose. Well then, I suppose I'll rest after I check for Magi☆Mari updates...

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's part of the problem!
Skip the distractions part!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yes, yes. Fine, fine.
I'll go turn in for the night.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...That man's unbelievable. He cannot even manage something as simple as going to sleep.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fine. I have an understanding of how Chaldea works, and now I shall rest. Don't bother me, mongrel.

 
**Mash:**
King Gilgamesh has gone back to his room.

 
**Mash:**
You did a good job showing him around today, Senpai. Will you also take a rest?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dealing with him has me exhausted.
 


---
 
**Mash:**
That's understandable.
He may not look like it, but he can be quite the handful.

 
**Mash:**
He had so many questions... “What's that?” “How do you use that?” And on and on... Well, they weren't actually questions, but...

 
**Da Vinci:**
It was almost more like a test, right? It's his way of seeing how much Fujimaru knows Chaldea.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. That's exactly what I thought he was trying to do.
I think he was actually enjoying himself, though.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No wonder I'm tired. I'm gonna take a nap...
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Understood. I will wake you up for dinner.
Good night, Senpai.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I'm sorry for interrupting your rest, but something terrible has happened!
The Doctor... The Doctor...!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He didn't collapse, did he?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He didn't die from exhaustion, did he?
 


---
 
**Mash:**
No. One of the staff members went to the Doctor's room to give him something to look over...

 
**Mash:**
...but since he didn't answer, and the door was open, they went into his room. He's nowhere to be found!

 
**Mash:**
The Doctor is not anywhere in Chaldea!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
You're late! How long were you planning on snoozing!? Well, I did just awaken, myself...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Shouldn't you be resting?
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
You're four thousand years too young to be worrying about my welfare! Besides, any time spent not fighting the King of Mages is time spent resting to me!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
You just worry about the matter at hand. Leave worrying about the future to those with Clairvoyance.

 
**Mash:**
Thank you.
So, King Gilgamesh...where is the Doctor!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Alright. Let me give you a quick briefing.

 
**Da Vinci:**
First, seven staff members mysteriously fell unconscious. The condition doesn't seem to be life-threatening, but we also can't seem to wake them.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And...Romani has disappeared from Chaldea. We even tried looking in the tea room behind the storage room.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...What's that?
I was not shown this room. Well, no matter.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Are there any other clues, Da Vinci?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Apparently somebody Rayshifted to Fuyuki in 2004.
So, to Singularity F.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Oh? That place somehow sounds familiar.
Fuyuki... Fuyuki... It's similar to Uruk. No...that's not it.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
And? Is that all you know?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Those who collapsed were analysts.
That's all we know.

 
**Da Vinci:**
If we piece together what we know so far, it looks like Romani somehow rendered these staff members unconscious...

 
**Da Vinci:**
...and then Rayshifted... At least,
that's what the facts seem to point to.

 
**Mash:**
(Dr. Roman had the aptitude to Rayshift?
We've never really verified&ndash;no, but even if he did...)

 
**Mash:**
The Doctor is not the type of person to do something like this. Are there any other possibilities, Da Vinci?

 
**Da Vinci:**
You say that, but the only other possible culprit would be me...

 
**Da Vinci:**
But I'm here, and there's no reason for me to Rayshift to Singularity F in the first place.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Strange things happen in Chaldea all the time. We need to respond swiftly even to the worst of scenarios.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
At times like this, I wish Holmes was here...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
At times like this, I bet Holmes is elsewhere...
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
What's this about some detective?
Have you forgotten that I'm here!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I can solve something so trivial as this in a heartbeat.
You hear me? A heartbeat!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
However, even I can't see into the past.
We'll need to be more proactive.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
We must go to the scene of the crime ourselves,
Fujimaru!

 
**Mash:**
Y-yes! I will make the preparations immediately!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
No, Mash. Not you. You're staying behind.
A Rayshift requires an operator, yes?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
The usual operators are unconscious,
and so we shall need a replacement.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Luckily, we still have half of the operators.
Ask them to teach you, as their kouhai.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...It will probably be useful later.

 
**Mash:**
That's... But someone must protect Master during Rayshift missions!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Did I not say I was going?
Or do you not trust in my strength?

 
**Mash:**
I-I do!
There's no need to worry with King Gilgamesh there!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Good response.
It appears I will have to be careful.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Now, begin the Rayshift! We're going to head to the scene of the crime, Fujimaru!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Understood, Boss!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Leave the Doctor to me, Mash!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Rayshift successful. I'm glad there was an instruction manual that covered emergency procedures.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It helps that we have plenty of data on Fuyuki.
But that Romani...where did he run off to?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Now then. Did he elect to do this himself, or did someone make it look like that was the case?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
What do you think, Fujimaru?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Dr. Roman wouldn't just up and disappear like this.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think he chose to do this.
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
I see. If you are so certain, it must be true.
...Hm?

 
**E：???:**
...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Bloodlust that can even be felt when using Presence Concealment. How boorish. How impudent. I suppose I should expect as much in such a hellish place.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hah! Trying to take my measure with an attitude like that. Absolutely laughable.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Stand back, mongrel. I'm going to capture that thing and drag the information we need out of it.

 
**E：???:**
...Commencing operation.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Gilgamesh:**
Hmph!

 
**E：???:**
...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It appears you've put too much energy into concealing your identity and made yourself weak in battle.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Or have you underestimated me because I'm a Caster? Fool. I may be a mage, but never forget that I am the King of Heroes!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fuhahaha, hahahahahahaha!

 
**E：???:**
Retreat.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...Hm. Escaping the instant I let down my guard with my boisterous laughter. Such insolence. A coward who refuses to show their face is not an enemy to be taken seriously, in any case.

 
**Mash:**
The enemy concealed their identity completely.
We tried to analyze them from here, but...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I see. Mongrel, of the Servants you have summoned, can any conceal their own identities?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Jack!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I wonder...
 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Someone who can fight while remaining anonymous...Jack the Ripper would be at the top of the list.

 
**Da Vinci:**
HOW CAN THIS BE!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
What's going on!?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Sorry. I just realized that a handful of Servant readings have disappeared from Chaldea, too.

 
**Da Vinci:**
It took us some time to confirm since we're missing some of our staff...I usually make it a habit to check on the Spirit Origin graphs...

 
**Mash:**
I ran a quick check, and Jack is indeed missing.

 
**Mash:**
The Spirit Origin pattern still shows it's in an excited state, which means she is still summoned...

 
**Da Vinci:**
We're trying to sort out which Servants are missing.
Hold on a moment, okay?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's hard to believe the Servants would betray us...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(...This is all really convenient...)
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, I'm picking up a Servant nearby.
Please proceed with caution.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...I head out of Chaldea to hide a bit as usual, and next thing I know, I'm alone in this burning city...

 
**Paracelsus:**
Oh? Why, if it isn't Master and King Gilgamesh.
What are you two doing here?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
That is what I would ask you.
And answer truthfully. Fail to do so and die.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Let us simply say that I wished for everyone to have an opportunity to rest.

 
**Paracelsus:**
Everyone is under orders to rest in shifts, but I wonder, can one really call it “rest” when it is made mandatory?

 
**Paracelsus:**
To be free of their distress and rest their minds...
I believed that to be in their best interests.

 
**Mash:**
Master...
I regret to inform you of this, but...

 
**Mash:**
It appears the unconscious staff members were all in contact with Paracelsus last night.

 
**Mash:**
We found little medicinal satchels that read “Safe, Cutting-edge, Forward-thinking Von Hohenheim Brand” under each of their pillows...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
At least it didn't say “Conceited.”

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Never seen a shadier Servant...
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
And? What exactly did you do?

 
**Paracelsus:**
The staff members were all exhausted, so I simply gave them special medicine, is all I can say...

 
**Paracelsus:**
Please rest assured. Leaving aside the question of ingredients, the medicine is both potent and effective. Until they have had adequate rest, nothing can wake them.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...Well, as to how exhausted they were...that is beyond my knowledge.

 
**Paracelsus:**
So if, for example, they were exhausted from three days of constant work, they will remain asleep for three days.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fool! If they sleep for three straight days, they will wake up dead! What about water and nutrients!?

 
**Paracelsus:**
Yes, yes... Well, we will simply have to rely on their natural resilience...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fine. Before we address the main problem,
let us deal with this fool. Understand, mongrel?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, my King.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
He's going to regret this!
 


---

**--BATTLE--:**

**Gilgamesh:**
That should take care of matters.
Have you learned your lesson, Hohenheim?

 
**Paracelsus:**
It...hurts...very much.
So much so that I want to try my own medicine...

 
**Paracelsus:**
They were homunculi that I raised myself, but were not strong enough to compensate for my rather unremarkable fighting ability.

 
**Paracelsus:**
It pains me to use them as mere pawns...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hm?

 
**Paracelsus:**
I'm leading you into a trap.
Would you still care to accompany me?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wait, Paracelsus!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'd better stop Dr. Feelbad over there!
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hold it. I understand how you feel, but calm down, mongrel. There's no need to rush in like fools.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
He's a Caster. Unlike the Assassin we encountered, he will be easy to track.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
However, we should try to discern their intent before we do anything.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...Does he want to separate us from something?
 
**Gilgamesh:**
Correct.
See, you can do it if you try.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...He doesn't want to get scolded?
 
**Gilgamesh:**
...Unbelievable... So this is the level of idiocy I should expect from today's youth...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Think, mongrel. He is trying to lure us to follow him, so what is the one thing he would not want us to do?

 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
His retreat is an obvious diversion. Don't you think there is somewhere else we should be searching?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
...The Greater Grail!
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
Right. There's nothing else more valuable than that here.

 
**Mash:**
Do you think that's the key in figuring out why Jack and Paracelsus are acting strange?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
What the hell, guys? So you just came straight here? Skipped the clever diversion and everything?

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Shoulda figured casting the low-energy dweeb as a decoy was a crap decision from the word go.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Anyway! Guess it's greeting time! Hiya, Master and Lord King Sparkly! Nice job getting here and stuff.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Is that...the Servant detected at the Greater Grail during the Zero incident?

 
**Da Vinci:**
His Spirit Origin isn't registered at Chaldea.
What is he doing here?

 
**Da Vinci:**
Were you the one who abducted Dr. Roman?

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Doctor, huh?
Nope, no doctor or scientist friends here.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
But that guy?
Doctor Roomy...was it?

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Well I've got him, obviously!
Cuz I accepted that job!

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Anyway, you wanna go, punks?
I better warn you, though...

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Eh? Warn you what, you ask? Well, I'm super weak!
So don't bitch when you kill me with that first punch!

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
But y'know... If you kill me with one punch,
you'll never find that Doctor of yours!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
What!? If we just attack, we'll never get the information we want!?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
That is quite the novel hostage tactic, mongrel! A Servant putting his life on the line for negotiations alone...unbelievable!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Take it eas&ndash;no, go all-out!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mash will find the Doctor!
 


---
 
**Mash:**
Yes! I'm scanning the surrounding area right now!
So please deal with this enemy, King Gilgamesh!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Oh? Is that so? Did you hear that, Avenger who even I didn't expect here? What's your next move?

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Hmmm, well, I really liked the bit where you don't care if I die. Not bad.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Honestly, this was supposed to be an ambush.
I was never super worried about living or dying.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
As long as my words held your attention, that's all that matters.

 
**Mash:**
Master!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Behind you, King Gilgamesh!
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
You call that a warning!? That was close!
It would've been fatal had it hit anyone but me!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I suppose I'll let it go.
Show yourself...third Servant!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
It appears I missed my opportunity. I should have moved a heartbeat earlier for a proper surprise attack.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Or was it a matter of execution?
Was our teamwork, perhaps, not so great?

 
**Mash:**
Impossible... You too, Amakusa? Please tell us...
What did you do the Doctor, and why?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Well, you see...
Avenger, do you have something to say about this?

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
You're askin' me? Wasn't it something like...Operation Eradicate Chaldea, or something?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Well, that's not exactly artful, but I suppose it will do. Yes, it's exactly what he said.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
It was the opportune moment...let us leave it at that.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Always vague and guarded, I see.
Is this the second time we've met?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I suppose it was not ME, specifically, who met you,
but our connection is engraved on my Spirit Origin.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I really must give it to you, apocryphal saint...
I heard you died very easily in Uruk's jungles.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
It never occurred to me that you'd have the spine to rebel. Did the ways of modern man wear on you?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Hahahaha! You may have made some valid points, but I'll leave the particulars to your imagination.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
The one thing I can tell you is that I am and always will be myself, no matter where I am.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Hey! Now that your surprise attack failed, hurry up and get this over with. Our opponent's not the type to be convinced in conversation.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Besides, these two are used to hearing your speechifying.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Anyway, it's just one dinky Caster. Instead of wasting your energy talking, how about you just kick his ass?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fine. I'll bite, Avenger.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
This magical staff is another of my precious treasures. I'm going to give you a taste of its power!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Yeowch! That REALLY stings!
Hurts like hell, but you didn't kill me, King of Heroes!

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Now brace for this! It's time for the Avenger's grudge...a curse that doubles the pain you caused and returns it to you!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Avesta's reversal, is it?
How dare you... I won't let you!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Ha!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Tch! Impudent...!
But it was a good shot!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I imagine your battle at Fuuma's side was quite the sight to behold. And yet, you were still defeated.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Perhaps you met some terrible monster?
Was your enemy a beast beyond your imagination?

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Yes. I can never look at a leopard again.
That Servant defeated me utterly.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
But what about you? You have the same sort of priorities and manner of thinking as I do...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...so I understand your train of thought. And if I know what you are thinking, I can find an opening.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hmph. It appears that rationality and cool-headedness of yours went out the window in that jungle. It's all well and good to be reasonable in your analyses.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But you are not strong enough to take initiative!
You are what they call a pushover!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I will crush you both!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
By my order, ready the arrows! Use my treasures to show them the power that protects Uruk! My resolve shall flood the earth...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Yes, I know. And I am going into this battle with every awareness...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hm!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Divine Judgment!?
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
Calm yourself! He's taken his turn, so now we're on a level field. Now it is your turn!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
! (Use Gandr on Amakusa Shirou...!)
 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...!

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Oof, you went THERE?

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Well, Super Amakusa's Noble Phantasm is super strong... I don't wanna die to the splash damage!

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Well, my only target is Gilgamesh.
You, on the other hand, will be spared...!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
! (Use Gandr on Aŋra Mainiiu...!)
 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Aw man...!
Ouch! Even Gandr hurts!!!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
So you managed to stop his Verg Avesta... A wise decision, as I would expect from my Master.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
His curse returns attacks much stronger to its victim. Had it not been stopped, the King of Heroes surely would have fallen, but...

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...what about after that? My Noble Phantasm will hit the King of Heroes before he can act.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Allow me to demonstrate. Heaven's Feel, activate.
Bring an end to all things...

 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
Hah! I can't stop laughing! Forget about me!
You have underestimated my treasures!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Even if I can't move, my treasures know and enact my will! Take this...Melammu Din&ndash;

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Hey, hey, HEY!
What are you all doing out there!?!?!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Eh!? Doctor!?
 


---
 
**Da Vinci:**
Romani just barged in...
We actually don't know what's going on ourselves...

 
**Da Vinci:**
Where the heck were you all this time?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Where? Actually, I was wondering what's going on here...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I was just taking a nap in my room...for about four hours...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I had a really great dream...but a nap shouldn't make me a missing person or anything!

 
**Da Vinci:**
That's a lie! You didn't show up on the surveillance cameras in your room!

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
...Phew. It looks like we can end our battle here now that Dr. Roman is awake.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Guess so. Saintly here is awfully quick to throw in the towel. Ain't it a shame that you were THIS close to taking him down?

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Welp, guess I better just disappear.

 
**Aŋra Mainiiu:**
Ahhh...but it was my chance to kill something that resembled a human...didn't matter who it was...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...Hmph. Does Merlin think I'll be grateful? I can't believe he'd stop this at the moment I was in mortal peril!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
No matter.
If he woke up, there's no reason for us to remain here.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
We can talk more when we get back to Chaldea.
Mash, prepare to Rayshift us back.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
(Sigh) I hope you know Rayshifting isn't free...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fine. I still don't understand the situation, but prepare for their return. Da Vinci, Mash, help me out.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
Please do not forget to collect Jack the Ripper and Paracelsus, too.

 
**Amakusa Shirou:**
And Jack in particular listened to us very well, so please take especially good care of her later.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Let me get straight to the point. This whole crisis was, in actuality, a drill. Everything happened according to my design and guidance.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I made it look like Romani left Chaldea by Rayshifting, made the staff members fall asleep...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...and arranged for three Servants to act as enemies.

 
**Mash:**
O-okay. Um, why would you do such a thing?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
After touring Chaldea with Fujimaru,
I got the general grasp of Chaldea's vulnerability.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I have tons of things to point out,
but the biggest issue is the humans.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
This place's operation is dependent on each individual's skills. The organization would collapse the moment someone goes out of commission.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
And while everyone seems to know this, there has never been any countermeasure of contingency in place.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
A solution...well, it may be difficult to find one until humanity is restored since there is presently no way to replenish lost personnel.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
So plans must be made to prepare for even the worst case scenarios.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Consequently, I anticipated certain possible crises.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
The King of Mages could attack Chaldea directly, for instance. So this was to prepare for such an eventuality as well.

**Fujimaru 1:**
I see...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
(So that's why the King looked like he was enjoying himself...)

**Jack:**
Hey, hey Mr. King.
What about my reward?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Just a moment longer. I have never failed to reward those who deserve it. The longer you wait, the greater your joy will be when you receive your reward.

 
**Jack:**
Okay!
Don't forget Nursery's gift too!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Now then. While the scenario did not quite go as planned, you all worked hard. You were like organs in a body compensating for other, missing organs.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Seeing how this has gone, even those who have fallen asleep may wake up and drift back off from sheer ease of mind.

 
**Mash:**
And what about Paracelsus's medicine...?

 
**Paracelsus:**
I would like to reiterate that this medicine simply makes people sleep until they are rested.

 
**Paracelsus:**
A single dose should have no significant side effects.

 
**Paracelsus:**
I have prepared a stimulant, but that appears to be unnecessary. Everybody should awaken shortly.

 
**Da Vinci:**
But what you said in the Singularity was more than a little disturbing...

 
**Paracelsus:**
I was only speaking of the effects of an overdose.

 
**Paracelsus:**
This may have only been an exercise,
but I would never lie to Fujimaru.

 
**Paracelsus:**
...Well, if you don't believe me, I suppose I am to blame for that. Try not to dwell on it too much...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I selected those who had the highest probability of turning on you. I wanted to test you all to see how you would react to the situation.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But you all managed to determine the cause of the issue and successfully executed a Rayshift. Even with some hiccups on the way, you all still pass.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
So that's what happened...now I see the big picture.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I understand your concern, but don't you think you went a little overboard with all this?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What would you have done if the King of Mages had actually attacked during this drill?

 
**Gilgamesh:**
I planned that part as well. Had there been an actual emergency, I arranged it so that everything would return to its appropriate place.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
You fell asleep and no one was able to find you because Merlin assisted me.

 
**Da Vinci:**
I knew it! That no-good Caster would definitely do something like that with a big smile on his face!

 
**Da Vinci:**
After all, the Illusion power of that swindling mage can fool humans AND electronic devices! He'd have no trouble tricking our cameras!

 
**Gilgamesh:**
But Chaldea wasn't the only thing that I tested during this drill. Mongrel...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...how could you not anticipate a situation where one of your Servants betrayed you? You're unbelievably naive and soft-hearted.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But they won't betray me.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll do my best so that never happens!
 


---
 
**Gilgamesh:**
...I see. It seems I am the fool for once.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
There's no sense trying to convince an idiot. And I suppose that makes me an idiot today for failing to consider that.

 
**Mash:**
What are you talking about, King Gilgamesh?
This is Chaldea...humanity's final stronghold.

 
**Mash:**
Infighting and backstabbing...those are concerns for after humanity is restored.

 
**Mash:**
Whether we are human or Heroic Spirit, everyone has assembled here for the same single goal.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...I suppose that is true.
If it wasn't, I wouldn't be here, either...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Fine. Forget betrayals.
The rest...well, we shall see...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
By the way, mongrel.
I quite enjoyed watching your reactions to all this.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
While far from ideal, your decisions were fascinating. Reflect back on your responses here later.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Sooo...it sounds like I was the one who benefitted most from this? Not only did I get ample rest, but I had the best dream...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
In my dream, Magi☆Mari did...ahh, nonono.
Better if I keep that secret.

 
**Gilgamesh:**
Quit your daydreaming.
You're making it sound like I did all this for you.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Oh, you didn't? This was actually the first time I had a different dream from my usual one...

 
**Gilgamesh:**
...Hmph. I'm going to sleep. Wake me up if something happens. No, don't bother. I'll wake up on my own.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Annnd, he left angry...
Well, I'm sure he'll be in a good mood again soon.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
That king has a lot on his mind.
He's not one to dwell on one single thing for too long.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
But anyway...I'm sorry, everyone.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
If I were more dependable,
I'd have woken up earlier...

 
**Da Vinci:**
It's fine. It's good that you got enough sleep for a change. And we realized how much we value you.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. We wouldn't know what to do without you, Doctor. You're the one who's pulled everything together and led Chaldea this far.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yep. We'll be together forever.
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Yeah, of course.
We've all been fighting to reclaim our future.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I know I caused you all trouble this time, but I still want to thank you. Thanks. I feel like I slept well.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you sure it wasn't thanks to Magi☆Mari?
 


---
 
**Dr. Roman:**
Uh...n-no...of course...not...
Well, maybe just a little...

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Anyway! We need to finish up our work for the day!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
It's almost dinnertime. Let's get our work wrapped up, and then all go to the cafeteria together!
