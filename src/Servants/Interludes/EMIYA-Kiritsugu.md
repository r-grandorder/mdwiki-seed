# EMIYA - Kiritsugu

## You, Like a Smiling Flower

**Narration:**
It was just another job.

 
**Narration:**
To them, it was just another minute Singularity. To me, it was a threat to be eliminated as a Counter Guardian.

 
**Narration:**
There's no need to go into details.
A target emerged, and needed to be taken care of.

 
**Narration:**
I simply do what I was meant to do:
I search for the enemy, engage, and eliminate them.

 
**Narration:**
The fewer people I engage with, the better.
At least, that's a personal choice of mine.

 
**Narration:**
Heroic Spirits. Heroes.
Many of those are mere shadows of mass murderers.

 
**Narration:**
In my opinion, they are all repulsive.
I prefer not to be by their side when fighting.

 
**Narration:**
But working completely independently is also difficult.

 
**Narration:**
It must be because of my lack of freedom as a Servant.

 
**Narration:**
Requiring Master to accompany us for Rayshifts is a pain. But I suppose that has turned out to be a blessing in disguise...

 
**Narration:**
Fujimaru, or Master, is quick to understand. And so we were progressing smoothly. This time is no different.

 
**Narration:**
The source of the minute Singularity... It could be a fragment of a Holy Grail, or a remnant of the original abnormality in the timeline.

 
**Narration:**
But they are all simple to track. A majority of them can be eradicated and handled with a single attack.

 
**Narration:**
Should it be a life-form, we kill it.
If it is an inanimate object, we destroy it.

 
**Narration:**
We seek it out, and then swiftly...

 
**Emiya:**
...This time around, it's quite clear-cut.

 
**Emiya:**
It must be a remnant of the many things you defeated. It's not as powerful as what we encountered in the final Singularity.

 
**Emiya:**
It's not alive.
It's already dead.

 
**Emiya:**
But it's taken in a shard of a Holy Grail.

 
**Emiya:**
Which then it turned into a minute Singularity.
What a pain. There are far too many Holy Grails...

 
**Emiya:**
...and, of course, shards in this Grand Order.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry to take up your time, Emiya.
 
**Emiya:**
Likewise.
Sorry to rope you into this.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thanks for finding it so quickly.
 
**Emiya:**
Finding the problem and dealing with it swiftly is my forte. I should be the one thanking you.

 


---
 
**Emiya:**
Now let's do it.
I'm sure IT'S also tired of waiting for us.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Commence battle!
 


---
 
**Emiya:**
Understood, Master.


**--BATTLE--:**

**Emiya:**
It ends here, you worthless pile of nothing.
I'm sure you're sick of living as an empty shell.

 
**Emiya:**
Mission completed, Master.

 
**Emiya:**
The minute Singularity has disappeared.
We should hurry back to Chaldea.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work, Emiya.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We got it done quick thanks to you.
 


---
 
**Emiya:**
It was nothing.
I just did my job.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
...

 
**Irisviel:**
......

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
.........

 
**Irisviel:**
............

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What are you two doing in front of Emiya's room?
 


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Mrow!?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Hmmm hmmm hmmm, fweet tweet tweet♪
(Humming and whistling)

 
**Irisviel:**
Um, it's actually a bit of a long story...

 
**Irisviel:**
...

 
**Irisviel:**
It has nothing to do with the Holy Grail. I am...like a Divided Spirit that poured out of the Holy Grail...

 
**Irisviel:**
That makes me unique among all the Heroic Spirits. But me standing right here is not related to that whatsoever.

 
**Irisviel:**
...We're just taking a peek.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's exactly how it looks!
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
When you're stalking prey, you hide in the darkness! This jaguar is sad to know you forgot the laws of the jungle!

 
**Irisviel:**
That's not it.
We're not out to kill anyone!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why don't you just talk to him?
 
**Irisviel:**
Yes...you're right.
We know that's the right thing to do...

 
**Irisviel:**
But that man doesn't want to see us.
Even when we speak to him, he just walks away...

 
**Irisviel:**
Honestly, we've run out of options.

 


---
 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
(Gasp!) Here he comes!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Deploying Noble Phantasm “Jaguar in the Black”!
It'll make this whole place SUPER dark!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Come on, Miss Iri and Master!
This way!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Be like glue, stick together and become one with the darkness...!

 
**Irisviel:**
Ah! My shadow...!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is that a Noble Phantasm you don't use in battle!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You sound like a boss.
 


---
 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(Hmmm...like the “Dancer in the Dark.”
Perfect. Nobody can see us from the outside!)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(It's a nagual-like Presence Concealment.
Behold, it can even hide friends other than Jaguar!)

 
**E：Irisviel:**
(Wow, how wonderful.)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(Yep, yep. Miss Iri, you really are accepting and wonderful too, meow. You get a Jaguar stamp... Stamp! Once more for good measure.)

 
**E：Irisviel:**
(Teehee. You flatter me, Jaguar Warrior.)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(By the way, it will only work for Jaguar during battle. Obviously, I can't hide an entire group in the middle of a fight!)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(Our prey is heading towards the Command Room.
Come on let's TAIL him!)

 
**E：Irisviel:**
(Roger that! Come on. Master, you too. Hold your breath and follow us. We're in this together now!)

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess I'll tag along.
 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(That's the spirit! Big Sis is glad to have an understanding Master. Here, I'll give you this wonderful dead spider as a reward!)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(Eh? You don't want it?
But it's a paw-sitively perfect gift!)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Chaldea has enough stalkers...
 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(Yeah, Jaguar thinks so too. I'm a teacher, after all. But they say: eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, and a Blaze for a Bunyan.)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(It's Emiya's fault for being so secretive.
Even Big Sis thinks... No, that's not my point.)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(Even I'm concerned for him. What in the world happened to him to make him act like that.)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(What's with the dark, gloomy aura? If we leave him alone, he's definitely gonna die alone.)

 
**E：Irisviel:**
(...Yes. I can't just sit idly by and watch that happen to him.)

 


---
 
**Emiya:**
............

 
**F：Emiya:**
.........

 
**Emiya:**
......?

 
**F：Emiya:**
...

 
**E：Irisviel:**
(It appears he was speaking with that Archer.)

 
**C：Jaguar Warrior:**
(What were they talking about?
Let's go ask!)

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Mee-wow, Emiyan! The Emiyan who at least makes us feel kind of comfortable!

 
**F：Emiya:**
... (She appeared out of nowhere again...)
Hello, jungle spirit. What business do you have with me?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ah... You're one of the few people who treats me properly, as a spirit! I paw-sitively love that!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
I'm compelled to send over a nice hawk carcass or something as a gift...but now's not the time. What were you HAWKing about!?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's...direct.
 
**E：Irisviel:**
(Yes, that's the kind of bluntness I'd expect from Jaguar Warrior...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That was a lame pun, but hopefully he didn't notice her true intent.
 
**E：Irisviel:**
(The Assassin... He left already, so hopefully it's not that obvious. Oh my, wait a minute...)

 
**E：Irisviel:**
(Does that mean we lost sight of him!?)

 


---
 
**F：Emiya:**
...

 
**F：Emiya:**
Oh, well.

 
**F：Emiya:**
After all, no matter how chaotic and full of ulterior motives your actions are, at least it's all usually done with the best intentions.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Yep, yep. That's because I'm an animal.

 
**F：Emiya:**
He asked about my magical energy consumption during battle. I answered as best I could.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Oh. That's insignifiCAT.

 
**E：Irisviel:**
(Yes, that's quite ordinary.)

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Whatever! I've GATO-go, first Emiyan!
Or actually, maybe you should be second...?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Anyway, until next time! It'd be nice if you made some good ta-PAWS so that I can have a nice drink soon!

 
**E：Irisviel:**
(Ah! Jaguar Warrior, wait, wait!)

 
**Altria:**
Yes, I spoke briefly with him.

 
**Altria:**
We spoke about what to be mindful when battling in groups. Other than that, nothing else significant...

 
**Diarmuid:**
Yes. I did just speak with him.

 
**Diarmuid:**
We talked about battles in the Singularity.
It wasn't that long of a conversation.

 
**Diarmuid:**
I actually had some questions for him of my own...but that should be for another time.

 
**Lord El-Melloi II:**
We spoke on various topics in magecraft.

 
**Lord El-Melloi II:**
He asked me a few things about grand magecraft and ritualistic magecraft, mainly about Mystic Codes.

 
**Lord El-Melloi II:**
And about the magical energy consumed when using things like that...

 
**Lord El-Melloi II:**
It was quite insignificant. It could have been covered in a few short words, really.

 
**Lord El-Melloi II:**
He was likely...

 
**Lord El-Melloi II:**
No, I'd rather not. This isn't something to involve myself in based only on speculation.

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Argh. We lost him!
Big Sis is a-paw-led!

 
**Irisviel:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh? Does Iri look relieved?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She looks happy, actually.
 


---
 
**Irisviel:**
Yes, you're right.

 
**Irisviel:**
I'm just happy.
I was worried that he was all alone in Chaldea...

 
**Irisviel:**
That's what I've been concerned about this whole time. It's always been on my mind.

 
**Irisviel:**
But maybe that was just my selfishness talking. No matter which “what if” version of him would appear...

 
**Irisviel:**
To think that I would be needed...

 
**Irisviel:**
I am such a greedy woman. I may not look like it, but I'm supposed to be a mature wife...

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Ku...guwah!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
For Master Iri to say words like “mature” and “wife” without hesitation...ahhh, she has so much adultness!

 
**Irisviel:**
Oh, y-you think so?
A-and what exactly is “adultness”?

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
This Jaguar is moved. I'm at a loss.
But I haven't lost the game! NEVER SURRENDER!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Remember to always be a tough cookie, and grin and bear it!

 
**Jaguar Warrior:**
Dammit!
We're going to play again...fur real soon!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's gone...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Um, for now, good work...?
 


---
 
**Irisviel:**
...


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Narration:**
...I managed to get away.
Ugh, what a pain.

 
**Narration:**
Divided Spirits like goddesses...two special Servants. Having their attention is nothing but trouble.

 
**Narration:**
First Servant: Irisviel von Einzbern.
Second Servant: Jaguar Warrior.

 
**Narration:**
Those two seem to want to talk to me excessively, and it's obvious that they don't like me to be isolated in the way I prefer.

 
**Narration:**
That is why I sought out other Servants to talk to.
I am not used to conversing with heroes of the past.

 
**Narration:**
I'm assuming El-Melloi II must have caught on,
but he's not one to talk. He's that kind of man.

 
**Narration:**
...Now, are the two Servants satisfied?

 
**Narration:**
It really is a pain in the ass...

 
**Narration:**
But this is nothing new. This isn't the first time I felt the burning gaze of two Servants in Chaldea.

 
**Narration:**
It's none of their business. I suppose their interest stems from knowing another version of me from some other version of history.

 
**Narration:**
Or something like that.
How stupid.

 
**Narration:**
Whoever they know, he is not me.

 
**Irisviel:**
...Yes, you're right.
A different person.

 
**Irisviel:**
But there must be SOME sort of connection between us. Though you may not believe it...

 
**Irisviel:**
And besides, my dear...

 
**Irisviel:**
You're watching me...following me with those eyes.
At times. Sometimes.

 
**Emiya:**
How dare you enter someone else's room.
You're like an Assassin.

 
**Emiya:**
And stop reading others' minds. I know that as a Divided Spirit of a Holy Grail...which makes you a part of the powerful wish-granting device...

 
**Emiya:**
...reading one's mind may just be second nature to you. But it's annoying to me.

 
**Irisviel:**
...I'm sorry.

 
**Irisviel:**
I never meant to annoy you. Nor do I wish for you to take an interest in the version of me in this world.

 
**Irisviel:**
But...you know...to see you so alone...

 
**Irisviel:**
...is very painful for me.

 
**B：Emiya:**
...
...

 
**B：Emiya:**
That's your problem.

 
**Irisviel:**
You're right.

 
**Emiya:**
...Not getting involved with others is my decision.

 
**Irisviel:**
Kiritsugu?

 
**Emiya:**
Don't call me that.
So...you do know that name...

 
**Emiya:**
...Please get out.
A day may come when the two of us speak...

 
**Emiya:**
But it is not today, Irisviel von Einzbern.

 
**Irisviel:**
...Yes.

 
**Irisviel:**
I'm sorry, Kiri&ndash;

 
**Irisviel:**
...Assassin.

 
**Emiya:**
A terminal of the Holy Grail.
Transformed from an Einzbern homunculus.

 
**Emiya:**
She'll be one formidable opponent.


**--SECTION BREAK--:**
 
**Illya:**
I-I just saw Caster run out of Assassin's room, crying!

 
**Chloe:**
You're right.
It seems that way.

 
**Illya:**
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what does that mean!?
And why...why is my heart racing so much right now!?

 
**Chloe:**
...Who knows?
Maybe because you're such a simpleminded brat?
