# Li Shuwen - Young

## Liu He Da Qiang

**Li Shuwen:**
Hngh! Hngh! Hngh!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmmm...I heard “Divine Spear” Li Shuwen was training, so I dropped by to see what kind of rigorous regimen he was putting himself through...

 
**Da Vinci:**
To be honest, it's pretty plain.

 
**Mash:**
Th-that's rude, Da Vinci!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Kaka! You're right about it being plain.

 
**Mash:**
You admit it?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
My purpose is to hone each and every one of my skills.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
The truth is, if you rip out someone's heart,
they'll die every time.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...But it's not that simple now that I've become a Servant. Still, death is inevitable even for us if our Spirit Core is destroyed.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
So, learning a new move as a Servant seems like a waste of time.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Honing skills I already have makes a lot more sense.

 
**Mash:**
Rather than learning a hundred skills, choosing to refining one skill to perfection... I do notice that seems to be a common approach among Servants.

 
**Mash:**
Although, there are also a lot of kings who are experts in all kinds of martial arts...

 
**Da Vinci:**
They have different roles to play after they become king, after all.

 
**Da Vinci:**
An expert begins their journey at a time and place of their choosing, but a king does not often have the ability to make those choices.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
You're right.
Rama often lamented that.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
“I'm actually better versed in archery... But if Saber is the best, as king that is what I must choose.”

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...Is what he said.

 
**Mash:**
I wonder why... There are kings who manifested as Archers and Riders here.

 
**Da Vinci:**
Ah, no, no. Gilgamesh is basically his own class.
I wouldn't even call him an Archer.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And the King of Conquerors is a Rider mostly in the sense of standing astride his people.

 
**Da Vinci:**
And in that same sense, Queen Medb...
Actually, let's not talk about that. It's probably not appropriate to talk about that in front of Mash!

 
**Mash:**
?

 
**Mash:**
By the way, did Rama choose to be a Saber class because it really is the best?

 
**Da Vinci:**
No, it's because he's a romantic at heart.
Anyway, we digress.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Okay, Master.
Thanks for waiting while I trained.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Want to head out to town for a breather?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm? What's all the commotion?

 
**Mash:**
It seems like it's coming from the town square.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is something happening?


---
 
**Civilian:**
You don't know? A renowned martial artist from the East is apparently here.

 
**Civilian:**
He's an amazing lancer, and he has tons of disciples.
I'm heading over there to check them out!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh? A martial artist in this land is a rare sight indeed.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hmmm...a renowned martial artist, huh?
Master, want to check them out to kill some time?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sounds good!
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Kaka! That's the spirit!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Um...
 
**Li Shuwen:**
We're just gonna get a glimpse.
A glimpse.

 


---
 
**Mash:**
Do you think it's all right?

 
**Fou:**
Fooou...

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
HahaHA!!! Secret technique: Ultimate Muso Lance!!!
This is unilateral, mind you!

 
**Renowned Martial Artist's Disciple:**
See our master's lance technique!? These are numerous unilateral techniques that branch from an egocentric dance!!!

 
**Renowned Martial Artist's Disciple:**
He's the greatest martial artist who's never lost after one hundred battles! Whoooo!!!

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What the hell are you doing, mustache face!?


---
 
**Women:**
Kyaaah! Amazing (somewhat).

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
Gufufufufu.

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
I wanted the North American ladies to go gaga over me as a martial artist brimming with oriental flavor! My plan worked flawlessly!

 
**Renowned Martial Artist's Disciple:**
You think so?
At least you haven't fumbled yet...

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
The longest journey begins with a single step!

 
**Women:**
Kyaaah! Amazing (use of a proverb)!

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
But I haven't come across a maiden who's totally my type.

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
Ah, is there no maiden out there who could see the true, real me?

 
**Mash:**
You're way off from looking like someone from the East... Actually you totally look Western...

 
**Mash:**
And you're not even a Lancer!

 
**Da Vinci:**
First and foremost, what is that idiot doing here?

 
**Renowned Martial Artist's Disciple:**
For a special price, you can get a personal lesson from our great master!!! First come, first served!

 
**Claque:**
Hey! I'd better get in on this!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Be calm. Be cool.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What should we do?
 


---
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Oh, I'm not mad. This is in such poor taste,
it's not worth watching.

 
**Renowned Martial Artist's Disciple:**
What? I just heard something inexcusable! Are you nit-picking at this captain's&ndash;I mean the master Lancer's skills?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
It's a cheap trick, no more than a show of brute strength. Everything about it is wrong. You need to start afresh by swinging a hoe around!

 
**Mash:**
Please, go back to the sea.

 
**Renowned Martial Artist's Disciple:**
What did you say!?
Master, beat 'em up!

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
Eh? Wait.
I know where this is going...

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
Aww, man! I'm about to get my ass kicked, aren't I?
Ahhhh!!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Li Shuwen:**
Hmnf!

 
**Renowned Martial Artist:**
Meooowww!
(Chicken)

 
**Renowned Martial Artist's Disciple:**
Oh, master's collapsed gushing blood from all his orifices! You bastards!!!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...That's all it took?
What a waste of time.

 
**Mash:**
That was a wonderful single shot.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Amazing!


---
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm. From the teachings of Bajiquan...actually, this is my thought...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
“Fear not the one who knows a thousand skills,
but rather the one who has obtained mastery of one.”

 
**Li Shuwen:**
You should be more fearful of those who have polished a single skill rather than those who possess one thousand skills.

 
**Mash:**
I see. That's why you keep training and practice the same skills over and over.

 
**Mash:**
This can be applied to Noble Phantasms, which are a manifestation of Heroic Spirits' legends.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Master, never forget that yourself. The truly terrifying adversaries, no matter which path they've taken, are those who have reached their peak.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'll keep that in mind.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll try my best!


---
 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hahaha... Now then. Shall we go out for some tea... No, in this land, it would be alcohol.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I don't often drink either,
but let's get going.

 
**Man:**
Hey. You trying to pick a fight?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Sorry, I got too excited,
but I don't feel bad.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
He was the one who picked the fight.


---
 
**Mash:**
He's just knocked out, so I think he should be all right.

 
**Mash:**
But please be careful.
The people in that bar seem unusually worked up.

 
**Child A:**
It's true!
That huge and hugely famous martial artist is here!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...Hm?

 
**Child A:**
He's skinny and glares like a wolf!
And he acts all big!

 
**Child B:**
That's a lie! Someone like that wouldn't come to some backward nowhere place like this!

 
**Child A:**
It's true!
Come on, I'll show you!

 
**Child B:**
Fine!

 
**Mash:**
A “huge” martial artist?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm. I can't allow the children to be exposed to bad influences.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
He's likely a fake like the one we saw earlier.
Let's go, Master.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Mister Shuwen, do you like kids?
 
**Da Vinci:**
Oh? It does seem so.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...No. I started to like children after I reached old age.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Mister Shuwen. You liked kids, right?
 
**Li Shuwen:**
...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Well, perhaps a bit.

 


---
 
**Li Shuwen:**
As I am now, though,
I am more a hungry wolf than an aged tiger.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I'm not up to teaching kids martial arts right now.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
At any rate,
let's go see this fake martial artist...

 
**ZHuge Martial Artist:**
That would be me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What are you doing here?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Seriously, what are you doing here?


---
 
**ZHuge Martial Artist:**
...Hm. Truthfully,
I myself do not know why I am here.

 
**ZHuge Martial Artist:**
I am beginning to suspect the horrid possibility that I was summoned here as a one-off joke.

 
**Child A:**
Hey it's him! Hey! Show us your martial arts!

 
**ZHuge Martial Artist:**
...So there you have it, Li Shuwen. If possible, I would appreciate it if you would demonstrate your martial skills.

 
**ZHuge Martial Artist:**
My falling rocks and flaming fans would be a poor example of martial arts to the children.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...This will make you the heel in their eyes.
Do you mind?

 
**ZHuge Martial Artist:**
Better that than for them to mistake me for a martial artist.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
You're right.
Then let's do this!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Zhuge Martial Artist:**
I. Have. Been. Defeated. (Monotone)

 
**Child A:**
He's STRONG!!!

 
**Child B:**
That single spear broke through those weird beams and rocks! Whoa!!!

 
**Child A:**
Hey, mister!
Do you think we can do that too?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm, who knows?
Maybe you can...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
But in order to do so, it's important to live your life with sincerity every day. There's also a saying: “with persistence a drop of water hollows out the stone.”

 
**Child A:**
I get it.
My mommy tells me not to be lazy too!

 
**Child B:**
But we came over to watch this while we were on an errand for mommy.

 
**Child A:**
Oh...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hahaha. That is fine.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Of course, if you continue to act idly...like that man, such things will come back to bite you later.

 
**Zhuge Martial Artist:**
(Sigh) I truly got the short end of the stick here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Good work...


---
 
**Zhuge Martial Artist:**
That aside.
Shuwen, I sense a Servant nearby.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, you're right.
That's amazing.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm. Has someone connected to me been summoned?

 
**Zhuge Martial Artist:**
That may be why I was pulled into this.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Children.
Remember to train in your art every day.

 
**Children:**
Okay!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...This is...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
What happenstance.
What luck.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I cannot hold myself back!

 
**F：???:**
Hahaha!

 
**F：???:**
I see now. My manifestation here seems to have affected things... Guess I caused a bit of trouble, huh?

 
**F：???:**
Either way.
Here I am, and here we meet.

 
**F：???:**
So, we've got no choice, do we, true martial artist?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Indeed. An opportunity like this&ndash;no...there will never be an opportunity like this ever again.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I never imagined I would come face to face with something out of legend!

 
**Yan Qing:**
Those glaring eyes like a tiger-wolf.
You are, without question, THE Li Shuwen!

 
**Mash:**
It's a good thing the children are gone...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Kaka.
Yes, my fists are deadly.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
People said what they wanted about me while I lived, but they were all correct.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
How could I call myself a martial artist if battle didn't get my blood pumping?

 
**Yan Qing:**
Ah...this is why battle freaks are a pain.
I suppose I must admit that I'm no different.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Take my fierce, swift shadow fist as your parting gift to return you to the afterlife!

 
**Yan Qing:**
Fist of Yan Qing...take it if you can!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Haa! With my spear or with my bare hands, I am not wanting for weapons! The skill I worked to achieve for my entire life shall be unleashed!

 
**Both:**
Brace yourself!!!


**--BATTLE--:**

**Li Shuwen:**
Surging! Surging!!! More! Show me more!!!
Truly a violent fist!!! Can art reach the true pinnacle!?

 
**Yan Qing:**
Hahahaha!
You're too slow, brute of a Lancer!

 
**Yan Qing:**
Nothing wrong with saving it all for one strike, but your emotions have gotten the better of you. I see through you!

 
**Da Vinci:**
Hmmm. I'm getting dizzy just watching this!
I can't tell who's got the upper hand!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hot-blooded...not a problem! To be called a divine spear and keep cool... I am not there yet!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
But it's still not enough! Not enough!
A true violent spear is one that would crush a swift fist!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
If not, I would be embarrassed to even use my second name of “Divine Spear”!

 
**Yan Qing:**
There!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
That's nothing!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm... This is the end. Even with the benefit of my spear...I stand here at a disadvantage.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Perhaps I need to abandon my second name of
“Divine Spear”...

 
**Yan Qing:**
Sheesh.
My other name is the Skillful Star.

 
**Yan Qing:**
With that flimsy spear against my fists, you managed to dodge, parry, and attack...

 
**Yan Qing:**
Just when I thought your attacks were almost too direct, you start throwing in whimsical twists... Let me guess: you've got a bad personality, right?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Of course. Same goes with you.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I can see your wicked personality through your fists and footwork, Skillful Star, Yan Qing.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
...

 
**Yan Qing:**
...

 
**Both:**
Wahahahahahah!!!

 
**Mash:**
Neither of them were holding back...

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Ah, that was great training.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
**Mash:**
...Training?

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Indeed. Training. Although, it would have been a fight to the death if we had kept going. There are so many things that I still lack.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I will polish my spear skills by fighting in the coming battles.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Skillful Star, Yan Qing,
I'd like a rematch one of these days.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Hahaha! Nice!
That's why I love martial artists!

 
**Yan Qing:**
Fine, fine! I swear by Tianqiao,
I'll sweep your spear AND your fists aside!

 
**Yan Qing:**
Okay. Now to deepen our friendship,
let's go out drinking!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
No, not at a drinking hole. Shall we go out to play a round of Go in the bamboo forest?

 
**Yan Qing:**
...You've got the taste of an old man.

 
**Li Shuwen:**
I just don't like to drink...and not only alcohol.
Tea especially.

 
**Yan Qing:**
Sheesh. Guess I have no choice!
I'll go along with what you want today.

 
**Yan Qing:**
But in exchange, next time you're gonna have to do what I want! We're gonna drink, eat, sing, and dance!

 
**Li Shuwen:**
Hm. In that, I too will have no choice.
Well, pardon me on the singing and dancing part, okay?

 
**Mash:**
...Did they just become friends?

 

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Looks like it.


---
 
**Mash:**
That's good, Senpai. Since they're both martial artists, I'm sure they have lots in common.

 
**Mash:**
Once their game of Go is done,
let's all Rayshift home.

 
**Mash:**
Good work!
