## Class Skills

**Territory Creation: [A]**

One can create a “Workshop”, which is an advantageous position for themselves as a mage.

Because Paracelsus possesses Rank A in this, it is possible to create a “Temple”, which is superior to a “Workshop”.

**Tool Creation: [EX]**

One can create devices tinged with Magical Energy.

Paracelsus has many anecdotes as a legendary alchemist, acquiring this Skill at Rank EX. It is possible for him to create a special crystal called the Philosopher’s Stone, artificial spirits that correspond to the Five Elements called Elementals, robots (homunculi) endowed with advanced judgement abilities and a multibody synchronized thinking faculty, and so on. In addition, mass production of gemstones used for Gem Magecraft is possible by utilizing a Spiritual Ley Line connected to his territory.

## Personal Skills

**High-Speed Incantation: [A]**

The ability to speak magical incantations at an accelerated speed. Paracelsus is able to finish Great Magecraft incantations in one step (at the speed of a Single Action).

In addition to this, for his case, Paracelsus attempts to make his Gem Magecraft (specifically, his Philosopher’s Stones) more efficient by combining them with his High-Speed Incantations.

**Elemental: [A+]**

The ability to employ artificial spirits that correspond to the Five Elements. Paracelsus also names these artificial spirits Elementals, or Elemental Masses more informally. They are literally magical existences created by using crystals of each elemental attribute, in which they are clumped together super densely, as a base. For example, a Fire Elemental Mass is something made from agglomerated flames, and it can manipulate ultra-high heat. If it is an Earth Elemental Mass, it is endowed with an ultra-high mass as well as a hardness equal to adamantine (diamond). (In addition, because the Void/Ether Elemental Mass is something different from “Ether Clumps”, so to speak, one should be careful.) Although it depends on the labour expended in its creation, they can also be manipulated as familiars that are feasible enough to support oneself even in Servant battles to some extent.

**Philosopher’s Stone: [A]**

The technique to manipulate a Magical Energy Accumulation Crystal――――or a Photonic Crystal more informally, that was purified by oneself. The rank greatly fluctuates according to the degree of purity that one can attain. Although various effects can be demonstrated depending on the rank, if it is at least Rank A, it is even possible to bring about a pseudo-immortality upon any given target.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Sword of Paracelsus: The Magic Sword of the Elementalist
- Rank: A+
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~99
- Maximum Number of Targets: 300 people

The original Azoth Sword. Paracelsus’ magic sword. A Mystic Code that utilizes the Philosopher’s Stone he created during his lifetime. The whole sword blade is composed of Philosopher’s Stones purified to an ultra-high density. Its original effect is to amplify/supplement/strengthen the power of Magecraft.

Paracelsus does not use this sword to attack his target(s) directly, but he instead exercises Ritual Magecraft instantly with the Magical Energy charged up within the sword, and by making use of all the Five Elements, a pseudo-composition of True Ether – which was viewed as the Magical Energy that the world from the Age of Gods was filled with – is stimulated. Although it is a small fragment, the pseudo-True Ether (Fake) that had materialized is converted into a light of destruction that mows down the surroundings.

Moreover, it possesses a true function that differs from its simple destruction ability…[1]

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronoun: watashi
Second Person Pronouns: anata / ○○ (companion’s full name)
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / ○○ (companion’s Class name)

## Personality

A scholarly mage who is intellectual and calm. Paracelsus’ temperament is mild and he does not like combat. Regarding young companions, he has joy in teaching and guiding them without his cool, calm and collected attitude being disturbed, even frequently expressing this joy by showing a smile on his mouth.

Unusual for a mage, Paracelsus advocates that human affection is a precious quality. He regards all modern mages far and wide as the descendants of his pupils whom inherited his teachings, receiving them with open affection as if they are like his children. He greatly believes that these men and women have infinite potential and are surely the future, and that the accumulation of their potential will even allow them to eventually arrive at the Root, the Truth of the World. If it is from the perspective of the common mage who honours the mages’ bloodline of individuals and family lineages, his words are close to the state of madness, but he does not intend to bend his beliefs. He is naturally a mad scientist.

There is absolutely no variation in Paracelsus’ interactions between men and women.

## Attitude Towards Master

Paracelsus quietly swears allegiance towards his Master. Or rather, it is more accurate to say that he swears friendship. In a situation like in a conventional Holy Grail War where a mage is his Master, he will build an equal relationship as a comrade who aims to reach the Root together with his Master. In the case where his Master does not study Magecraft, he will propose to be their “friend”.

The wish Paracelsus wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to reach the Root.” Speaking of that furthermore, he surely wishes to ascertain his personal opinion that the Ether that consists of the Truth – which once filled this world – and the light of the planet (like that of the Sacred Sword for instance) were probably the lights shining out of the Root――――or, so it was. It may not come to light that he, as of the present time, is seeking atonement instead.

## Dialogue Examples

“Please, become friends with me.”

“All my dear children whom fill this earth, you are the brilliance of the precious stars.”

“The Ether’s finality… I think it will lead to the ritual of the Age of Gods that was lost. I want in my hands… the radiance of the righteous stars that the sages of Chaldea attained far off in the ancient times. That is to say, it is the ultimate light – which the universe was once full of – that twinkles fully, and simultaneously, it also seems to be the light of this planet.”

“… The light of the planet emitted from your sword. It is very, very beautiful.”

“Please try to pay attention… to the kind of Magecraft an Average One is capable of.”

## Historical Character and Figure

A legendary physician and alchemist. In the 16th Century, Paracelsus von Hohenheim is known as a historic figure who played an active role in the Renaissance Period. Spanning over the course of his lifetime, he devoted himself to the studies of medicine and alchemy, having left behind many achievements and books such as the “Rediscovery of the Four (Five) Elements” and the “Rediscovery of the Three Primes”.

## Character in FGO

A rare figure who left his name in both human and magic history. A powerful mage (Average One) who is endowed with the attribute of “Void” in addition to the four attributes of “Earth”, “Water”, “Fire” and “Wind”, studied Gem Magecraft, and was also considered to have deeply influenced the development of alchemy as a Magic Foundation. In the significance of the Magic Foundation of what mages far and wide was taught as alchemy in the modern era, there is a likelihood that this one man is the pioneer that deeply engraved alchemy into this world. Although Paracelsus was a person who was close with the Clock Tower, it is said that he exceptionally conducted networking with both the Atlas Academy and the Wandering Sea, having advanced their mutual researches.

However, as one can further understand from the matter of his name being visibly left behind in history, Paracelsus has a tendency to “spread to people” the secrets of Mysteries that should have essentially been concealed, having continued to publish towards the general public a fragment of his magical research as theories while ignoring the inhibitions of the Clock Tower and the warnings extended to him from that association again and again, and in his final moments, he lost his life to enforcement figures from the Magic Association as he was in the process of increasing the production of his Philosopher’s Stones and distributing these mass-produced items. During the occasion of assassins having arrived at his mansion, it is said that he showed absolutely no panic in his bearing, having greeted them while smiling.

A rare mage who surely loves children and values humanity. That is indeed Paracelsus von Hohenheim――――However. The possibility of him suddenly abandoning his entire creed and falling into injustice is also by no means zero. For example, what if there is something like a situation where he came across someone connected to the Root itself that he is aiming for?

## Colour Correspondence of the Five Elements

Earth (Yellow), Water (Silver), Fire (Red), Wind (Blue), Ether (A deep Purple close to Black).

At the time when the colours were established for the Five Elements in Western Magecraft, the basis of the colour scheme is the same as the assignments based on India’s Tattva.

## Standard Weapons

Paracelsus can carry out long distance attacks by means of Magecraft. He can carry out magic attacks by employing the Five Great Elements. When using Magecraft, an object similar to a large gemstone (Elemental) that corresponds to the element being used floats around Paracelsus’ surroundings.

## Related Characters

**Artoria (Saber) / Arthur (Proto)**

Concerning those who possess Excalibur that is filled with the light of the planet, it is very much a subject of research, and simultaneously for himself, Paracelsus shows an obsession towards it as an objective that he must overtake.

**Siegfried**

If Paracelsus becomes acquainted with the one who owns Balmung, the sword with True Ether itself hidden within it, then he will very much— (omitted)

**Makiri Zolgen**

An acquaintance during his lifetime. A mage who possessed noble thoughts, and although their research contents differ, Paracelsus wanted to become friends with him. Since he is aware of Makiri as an idealist who should be a noble and respectable person, even if he saw Makiri at the time of the 21st Century, it does not appear likely that Paracelsus will regard him as the very same person.

**Leonardo da Vinci**

As a matter of fact, another acquaintance during his lifetime. Paracelsus deeply respects da Vinci, who has been literally omnipotent even in regard to Magecraft. Paracelsus wanted to become friends with him, or something like that, but he feels da Vinci is too awe-inspiring to do so. He often does not remember since when da Vinci did become a woman.

“When I met him for the first time… well now, which was it…?”

**Arash / Henry Jekyll / Hyde**

“…… For some reason, it feels like I am about to recall something.”

## Comment from the Illustrator

I smile without knowing why every time Paracelsus appears in the game on-screen. Yes, I like a teacher who has a tendency to be serious as well as one who is close to being a gag. (Nakahara)

## TL Notes

[1] – As demonstrated in Fragments, the sword blade that is composed of Philosopher’s Stones has an ability as a quantum computer where it can analyze and respond to the magical properties emitted by his opponent’s ability and then immediately encroach on it, making that his sword’s own ability. It basically steals one’s powers for his own use. In that case, it’s very similar to da Vinci’s Noble Phantasm or even the Moon Cell’s calculation faculty.
