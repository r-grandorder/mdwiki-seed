## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [A]**

No matter what Great Magecraft it is, Magecraft spells that are at the Ranks of A and below will be nullified.

All claims and requests for presents are shut out. Santa Alter’s heart is tough.

**Riding: [A]**

The ability for riding.

If Santa Alter has the Llamrei II, a sleigh carrying presents, she boasts that it is even possible to deliver presents in one day from the order date. By the way, the reason the sleigh is soaring in the sky is due to Alter’s Magical Burst.

## Personal Skills

**Intuition: [A]**

The ability to always “feel” the most suitable development for oneself during combat.

Speaking of Alter, although she has attained more endurance than quickness, more power than speed, and became more insensitive than sensitive, for Santa Alter, she has no such stereotypes. For the objective of swiftly delivering presents to the children even in one second, that sixth sense is rising to its highest level.

**Magical Burst: [A-]**

Speaking of Alter, although she has a dark aura hanging in the air around her, as if to say, “That battery, isn’t it leaking out?”, that sort of property is unnecessary for a Santa. Since the presents must not be damaged, Santa Alter is intentionally lowering the rank of her Magical Burst.

“Why can’t you usually show that thoughtfulness, Miss Santa?”

**Saint’s Gift: [EX]***

A Skill acquired by turning completely into Santa Claus. One can give presents, thereby enriching hearts.

But because the design of the presents subtly differs even from what the targeted persons requested for, the effect of this is not able to go that far in fulfilling the targets’ expectations. One could even say that Santa Alter has the natural talent for making choices that subtly perturb the traumas of the recipients greatly.

*The Saint’s Gift Skill is C-rank in the game profile

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Excalibur Morgan: The Sword of Promised Victory

- Rank: A++
- Classification: Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~99
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1000 people

The Sword of Black Auroras. Just as it is. The fact that it does not even have any sort of twists in its name makes one feel the difference between Santa Alter and the Servant who stood out on Halloween. It is an unnecessary thing to Santa Claus as a matter of fact, but since it seems there are even monsters that might appear during Christmas because of some trouble, there is no drawback in taking it with her.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: watashi
- Second Person Pronouns: omae / kisama / ○○ (without honorifics) / “tonakai” (“Reindeer”) to the Master
- Third Person Pronouns: omaetachi / kisamara / ○○ (without honorifics)

## Personality

Although Santa Alter has the personality of Saber Alter as she is now, the fastidiousness within that personality has somewhat changed to a frank way of doing things due to being bestowed the post of Santa. As a Santa, her dreams and ideals of being merry and scattering smiles has resulted in her heart of ice, as if it was permafrost, being removed. Nonetheless, there are no changes in her Spartan doctrines, that being unaffected and sincere. She runs about for the sake of giving presents to good children, and although she gives punishments to bad children, she throws presents to them later on after they become good children.

## Attitude Towards Master

Santa Alter gathers unconditional trust in the Master and tells them of an aspiration, of playing an active role as Santa together. The thickness of that trust is an important part, and yet, extremely harsh————to the extent that the Master is entrusted the role of reindeer, the central part of Llamrei II. And it goes without saying that the Master chosen as her reindeer will be anticipating heavy labour extending over a period of one week. Although Alter is greatly pleased with herself as a Santa, there is absolutely no need for the Master to interrupt that mood. Because there is no need to speak well of her as a Santa. If one says something the likes of “You’re an excellent Miss Santa, aren’t you?” to sympathize with her success, one will think that it might be the day the sleigh rises to the stratosphere.

## Dialogue Examples

“Merry, excuse me for entering from the chimney. Santa Claus’ elder sister has arrived to comply with the summoning. Now, are you my reindeer?”

“I am pleased with this appearance. I will never change my clothes.”

“I sealed the state of Saber. I am a Rider who mounts on the Master called ‘Reindeer’. There is no more than a gust of a violent wind that comes out on the Holy Night… Ooh, I see you are getting excited.”

“Sink into the Holy Night! Excalibur Morgaaaan————! (Humming of Jingle Bells follows)”

## Character in FGO

Enter “Miss Almost Weekly Santa Alter”.

Artoria Alter, being resolved to wipe out her own image, took on this form and attempted to carry out activities as the Ally of Children/Santa Claus. The sack she holds in her hand is packed with handpicked presents that she spent one whole year to save up.

Although Artoria Alter has changed into the Rider Class, it does not mean there are extreme changes that were made. Her weight has increased due to the weight of the presents. The lack of futility in her speeches and conducts and her cool-headed character closely resemble Alter, but her aspiration towards Santa Claus that exists within her foundation is making her just a little more kind.

## Related Characters

**Elizabeth (Halloween)**

An eyesore, for Elizabeth is the same Festival Event Servant-type as Santa Alter. Santa Alter will turn Elizabeth into a dragon steak for everyone.

**Asterios**

Because it is said to be unreasonable to get somebody to follow her lead during Christmas, Santa Alter feels an obligation. The present delivered last is obviously a crown for Asterios.

## Comment from the Illustrator

Out of the simple thought where we want to do an event that differs from the usual Christmas Events, Santa Alter was referred to first of all. Well, when I was trying to get into her design, a design that gets through the words called “Santa Alter” could not easily come into sight, and that proved to be very difficult. Concerning the result, I am thinking, ‘I wonder if I came to indicate in one way or another a “Ms. Santa who differs from the usual” that I aimed for in the beginning.’ (Takeuchi Takashi)
