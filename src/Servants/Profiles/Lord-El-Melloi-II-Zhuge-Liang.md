(My chinese friend said translating the name of this 2 NP is like trying to translate a japanese name; certainly possible translating individual kanji but you know, theyre names. Shí Bīng Bā Zhèn is mostly known in the western as Stone Sentinel Maze, but even then its not 100% accurate. Meaning and context wise my chinese friend said that for Chu Shi Biao’s closest rendering is Memorial Upon War.)

# Character

## Pronouns

- First pronoun: watashi
- Second pronoun: omae
- Third pronoun: kare/kanojo

## Personality

His personality is that of Lord El-Melloi II.

He is a slightly moody sort of magus with a meddlesome nature at the root, which ends up giving heavy influence to the people on his surroundings.

He is particularly good at deciding courses of action; countless people have discovered their own ability thanks to him.

Although, it can’t be denied that at the same time he himself possesses a complex in regards to his own powerlessness….


## Attitude Towards Master

He mostly looks after the Master basically as one of his student.

El-Melloi II, who had taken in Kongming’s knowledge, have an overwhelmingly abundant experience on his hand compared to the many magi in this world. Consequently, the Master becomes his student from the beginning.

## Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Zhuge Kongming. ...Hm, you think I’m not him?

Indeed I am not. I am El-Melloi II. Nevertheless, I do inherit his power. There is no problem.”

“Things I am fond of? Let us see… Pupils with good perception, classroom filled with silence, and colleagues whose head are not clogged with tofu… I suppose.”

“As you can see, I am in the middle of my game. We can speak, but don’t tamper with my hair. It’s distracting me from levelling up.”

## Historical Character and Figure

The description below is not of Zhuge Kongming, but of the basis of his outer shell, Lord El-Melloi II.

Lord El-Melloi II is the representative head of House El-Melloi, one of the twelve nobles that rule over and manage the Clock Tower that is the center of Magic Association. A lecturer of the department of Modern Magic, all of his pupils had managed to grow into excellent magi.

It is said that should he ever recruit his pupils to his own faction, the Clock Tower’s influence chart would easily change; but he himself has no intention to do so.

His insight in observing the true nature of a human has reached the point of being sublimated as a Servant’s Skill. No matter how much a famed magus may conceal his or her thaumaturgy, he possesses the terrifying ability to divulge it without any constraint.

Normally, even if the outer shell is El-Melloi II, in the inside is still Zhuge Kongming and he should have conduct himself as Zhuge Kongming. However, upon the agreement of the goal of protecting the Human Order, there is no problem whichever between the two that holds the reign of the body; in the end of the discussion, Lord El-Melloi with his discernment of the modern world was decided to become a Servant.

Although he himself is dissatisfied of being unable to do something with his own power, he do understand that he would not be able to do anything alone. He vows that he will protect the Human Order together with the other Servants.

Furthermore, there is no change of his very power as a Servant or in his knowledge quantity upon his repeating spirit foundation’s ascension, which in the end returns his form to that of a young boy (roughly 19 years old).

According to a certain ill-natured goddess, the situation of him fighting as the leading part being his form as a young boy is most fitting. Perhaps for Lord El-Melloi II himself, the unforgettable battle in which he shines the most is the one of this moment.

## Related Characters

**Alexander**

A man of great talent, still unfinished in his growth. And yet, there is already enough of his charisma that it reminds me of his dignity back in the day. ...Well, in that case, I would like to see with my own eyes of what would happen that changes him.

**Iskander**

Things like the memory when he had been summoned are haziness, not even a dream for the current him. I know that much already. I know, and still.

## Comment from the Illustrator

The idea of the third ascension being Waver felt like a good idea when it struck me, but upon the implementation I felt somewhat anxious if it would be a disappointing development for those who like El-Melloi II. I am really relieved that I don’t need to worry about that thanks to the option of being able to choose the ascension stage. (Takeuchi Takashi)
