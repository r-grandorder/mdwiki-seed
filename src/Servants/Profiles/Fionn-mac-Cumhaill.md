Connotes the good quality of one’s visual acuity. It allows one to capture distant targets and improve their dynamic vision.

**The Beauty of Trouble with Women: [A]**

A self-awareness that has been raised to the level of a curse————it is easy for Fionn to encounter troubles with women due to the women’s beautiful appearances being the source of those troubles.

**Magecraft: [B]**

Fionn has studied the druids’ Magecraft. There are many spells that can be employed in combat, such as attack spells, attack support spells, recovery spells, etc., but it is not a magic system that primarily excels in direct combat.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Mac an Luin: The Undefeated Violet Healing Flower
- Rank: A+
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~100
- Maximum Number of Targets: 300 people

A magical spear that is considered to be the spear that killed Aillen, a Divine Spirit that has fallen to the state of an evil fairy. A two-handed spear that is more than 2 meters in length.

In addition to being endowed with an auto-attack function, the spear can nullify all negative effects that influence the mind. If the True Name is released, it fires a single attack that is accompanied by a violently rushing stream of “water” that the War God Nuada – Fionn’s ancestor – administers.

Its True Name comes from an inscription about the beloved sword of Fionn mac Cumhaill. That sword is often viewed in the same light as his spear, and it was assimilated with that spear that slew the Divine Spirit Aillen at the time of being established as a Noble Phantasm.

# Uisce Beatha: O’ Lives Scooped with These Hands
- Rank: C
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 0
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

Uisce Beatha (Water of Life). Water scooped by Fionn’s hands will entirely gain the power of healing————the anecdote itself of his Water of Life that became a Noble Phantasm. No matter if it is the water of a fountain, spring water, or tap water, “if scooped with both hands”, it will immediately become water that has a recovery effect. If used on humans, their wounds will be healed, and it also works the same on Heroic Spirits. Poisons will also be cleansed from this water. Fionn usually takes in the water he scooped into a water bag he carries with him so he can readily use it when necessary.

# Fintan Finegas: Biting the Thumb Swelling with Wisdom
- Rank: B
- Classification: Anti-Wisdom Noble Phantasm
- Range: 0
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

Perhaps there seems to be another proper True Name for this Noble Phantasm (however, the subtitle is the same).

The anecdote of the Salmon of Knowledge which granted wisdom to Fionn that became a Noble Phantasm. Because that salmon’s fat remains imprinted on one of Fionn’s thumb, if that thumb is licked, it is said that one will immediately acquire great wisdom. It is also the origin of the “Uisce Beatha: O’ Lives Scooped with These Hands” Noble Phantasm as that is viewed as something based on this Noble Phantasm’s very anecdote.

Incidentally, salmon’s fat contains mostly DHA which boosts one’s powers of concentration.

## Personality

A noble knight who honours impartiality and the path of righteousness. At the same time as being such a person, Fionn is open-minded and pleasure-seeking. He also does not bear any doubt, not even a tiny bit, about his own charm. “Come now, for even these days, I’m completely shining, no?!” Similarly like his looks, his conducts are also elegant. However, his way of thinking is comparatively bold. Because he has the disposition of his youth that is suitable for this outward appearance, one would not particularly catch sight of that tenacious personality in the later anecdotes of his past life. He is self-conscious of his own beauty as a reality. Regarding his looks, it is something he was born with, so he does not have to boast about it, but it is a pet theory that it is something that can even be utilized.

Although he has a personality that is filled with a lot of love, even Fionn has that sort of love that is treated as unique and eternal, devoted only to his first wife. Only in the moments when he thinks about her, Fionn mac Cumhaill is not a knight leader, but one young man who is honest with himself.

Even though he does not realize it, as a matter of fact, Fionn is deeply jealous. After decades of years later from his present appearance, of which this present appearance was the prime of his life as a knight, there was an anecdote where he resented his subordinate Diarmuid for snatching away his third wife – the beautiful Gráinne; later on, Fionn chose to let Diarmuid die without helping him after the latter fell into a predicament, solely out of the resentment that stemmed from his deep jealousy. As a result, Fionn stirred the disappointment of many of his subordinates after that incident, causing a war where the Knights of the Fianna divided into two sides, and before long, even Fionn had lost his life in the middle of the conflict.


## Attitude Towards Master

Fionn will not make changes to his elegant speeches and conducts in regard to his Master. Because he also worked for the sake of the High King of Ireland since while he was alive, he has absolutely no reluctance in regard to acting under somebody as a Servant. As a Hero, he takes into consideration that if he can work for the sake of the people, there will also be no problem of any kind for him because of that.

The wish Fionn wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to fix his tendency to get into trouble with women.” He thinks that perhaps all the tragedies of his lifetime stemmed from his fate of having trouble with women, no matter what. However, since that is his way of thinking at the occasion of having materialized in this form, in the case of having materialized in another form, there is even the possibility in that he may have a different view and wish.

## Dialogue Examples

“When it comes to beauty, it’s my victory. So, I wonder who the victor will be if it comes to military prowess?”

“Hey, I’m strong. That’s bad luck for you, isn’t it?”

“Even if it’s to the extent that I wouldn’t call it omniscience, you would somewhat understand. For instance, if I materialized as a Caster, then it’s expected that I’m able to demonstrate the power of the Salmon of Knowledge even more.”

“Magnificent. I would like to add someone as stalwart as you to my order of knights!”

“Biting my thumb. Yeees, wisdom is swelling up!”

## Historical Character and Figure

A descendant of the Celtic War God Nuada, and the leader of the glorious Knights of the Fianna. A Great Hero who established many valourous deeds, such as by aiding the capital by killing a wicked Divine Spirit that manipulated slumber and flames as well as by defeating invaders and monsters as the guardian of Erin (Ireland). Having mastered Celtic Magecraft and wisdom, Fionn is endowed with many abilities and Noble Phantasms.

## Character in FGO

Serving the High King of Erin, Fionn mac Cumhaill was a man who earned the achievements worthy for him to be declared the leader and further judged as the greatest knight of the Knights of the Fianna. The fallen Divine Spirit Aillen, the magical Demon Boars, the Horses of the Underworld————he defeated a large number of these wicked yet powerful monsters, and in the end, he defeated even the War God Nuada – who is his divine ancestor – in battle; however, when times of peace come about, it has been said that he was a magnanimous man who spent his time quietly while carrying out hunts and the like together with his subordinates in the order of knights.

Fionn willingly went on a journey as a Great Hero with nothing about that journey that can be criticized by others, but during his personal life, he had a fate of trouble with women. His first trouble was being charmed by a pair of beautiful sisters, having received a curse from that incident. His misfortune further continued thereafter, where seven years of his youth were stolen from him for antagonizing a fairy in a dispute concerning his first wife, and then, because of the dispute concerning Gráinne, his third wife, it resulted in the collapse of the glorious order of knights.

Troubles with women. Is it not that he himself is surely the problem of those, and not that there is a problem with women? Up to his final moments, Fionn mac Cumhaill never really took that into consideration.
“What the heck went wrong?”
Even now, having transformed into a Heroic Spirit and having materialized as a Servant, he still does not comprehend that.

## Related Characters

**Diarmuid**

As far as Fionn himself, who materialized in his youthful appearance, is concerned, because whatever happened around his later years were no more than “memories of that time then, and not now”, he will definitely say to Diarmuid, “I’m glad to see you again after a long time”, without relatively minding about it. However, for Diarmuid, whose memories of his death were exactly because of his troubles with Fionn, most of all of that is super uneasy for him…

**Bedivere**

“How did the Airgetlám get here? I wonder if it’s really the genuine article?”

**Beautiful Female Servants**

“Oh dear, this is unmanageable, eeh?… Ah, looks like once again, I’m completely shining!”

## Comment from the Illustrator

The image of Fionn’s face was settled in almost one shot, but I was greatly troubled about his costume. I regret it in that I should have raised his tights even more for the times when the Celts all come to appear together in the distant future. Even though a perfect ikemen-like characteristic was specified for him, there were many more cheerful lines implemented for him than what I had thought, so I should have made his facial expressions more amusing, yeah?… Well, to be honest, this uncle is about the same age as me? And he is madly in love with his Showa sense brimming over. (Moriyama Daisuke)
