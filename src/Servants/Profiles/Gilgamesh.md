## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [E]**

Protection against magic. Incapable of invalidating magic, but somewhat reduces the damage value.

**Independent Action: [A+]**

The ability to act even in the absence of the Master. It’s already on the level where he can do as he pleases.

**Divinity: [B]**

He possesses the greatest of divine spirit aptitude, but it receives a rank down due to his dislike of the gods.

## Personal Skills

**Charisma: [A+]**

The ability to lead and command large armies.

At this point, it is no longer popularity, but a type of curse instead.

**Golden Rule: [A]**

Not a golden proportion of the body, but the fate of how much wealth follows him around in life.

He can do even multi-millionaire, goldy style. Has no money troubles for the entirety of his lives.

**Collector: [EX]**

The ability to acquire and manage items of high quality.

EX means outside the standard, but in Gilgamesh case, already various treasures are counted inside his vault in the state of “what is yours belongs to me”.[1]

There are also cases where, if he were presented with a target treasure, he would discover from his fault the “original” that became its basis and relabel it.

[1] It’s a Doraemon joke, in case you didn’t get it. Gilgamesh, mankind’s oldest Jaian.
To note, this is also the skill that basically is responsible for GoB treasure paradox

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Star of Genesis Which Separates Heaven and Earth: Enuma Elish

- Rank: A++ [1]
- Type: Anti-World Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~99
- Maximum target: 1000 individual

Enuma Elish.
Time and space severance by means of Ea, the Sword of Separation.
The dislocation of the wind pressure, compressed and clashing inwardly, turns into a pseudo space-time dislocation, pulverizing everything which stands to oppose it.
Its attack value cannot be defended against without using an anti-purge[2] armor class or counterbalancing it using damage of the same level.
While the Sword of Separation, Ea, is categorized as a sword, in itself it is close to that of a staff. Its three lithograph each represents heaven, earth, and underworld; They each rotate to a different direction, which represents how the world is. All three together represents the universe.
Possessing output that equal to or even greater than Artoria’s Excalbur, it is the sword that “tears the world.”

[1] Post interlude, it’s EX. SOmetimes GO mats gives out ranks depending on ingame rank and not actual rank.

[2] Fun thing i found. I had always thought it to be 粛清 (shukusei), which means (political) purge, but it apparently is 粛正 (shukusei), which means enforcement. They are both political terms. The difference would be, 粛清 is the desire to make disappear not only things that are unjust and impure, but also EVERYTHING that stands in your way. Basically, press ctrl+delete on anyone that is a nuisance for you.
Whereas 粛正, the terms being used for Enuma Elish here, is the desire to remove all that is unjust and impure, and then returns to proper form. Basically, use ctrl+find then replace things that are bad with better things.
I feel like this is important, because this strengthen the image that Enuma Elish is not an attack that only pulverizes, but also sorta drive home the concept that Enuma Elish was also an attack that rebuilds, which ties in to how Ea (drill) is the power used by Ea (god) to separate heaven and earth from its chaotic state and then builds bunch of cool things, like human civilization and stuffs.
Technically, both is still purge if you squint at it the right way. Just that the one used here has a more positive connotation.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First pronoun: ware (ore)
- Second pronoun: zasshu/omae/kisama/** (no honorifics)
- Third pronoun: omaetachi/kisamara/** (no honorifics)

## Personality

Brutal, ruthless. With a golden armor set, splendour beyond limit, he is an extraordinary Heroic Spirit with superfluous treasures that he unleashes as if they are water.

With neither blood nor tears, he is a hero who carries to the extreme and enjoys all manners of treasure and pleasure.

The opinion of people does not reach his ears, and the only thing he takes as absolute is his own standard; a tyrant who empathizes not with the thought of others or their way of being.

However, possessing no empathy does not mean he holds no interest.

When confronted with unknown existence of concept, he would show a curiosity like a child would; yet he would also abandon it out of boredom or having decided that he had completely got to the end of it like a child would.

He treats and judges both good and evil equally.

As far as Gilgamesh is concerned, life is no other than whether you “die immediately” or “die eventually”.

Should he recognize a “life that should die immediately”, then he would end it, be it even the life of a wise one.

A judgement as if equal the truth of the universe;

An evil rule during times of intoxication and beyond recollection;

when he does something, he does so with the arbitration of a king.

For that is what an absolute monarch is.

While he is moody in nature, there are no(t much) moments where he does something personally using bad mood as the pretext.

Occasions when he ends the life of others would be when their soul turns repulsive, or when they themselves bare their hostility toward Gilgamesh.


## Attitude Towards Master

During his live, he had once wish for immortality, yet after obtaining the miraculous medicine he ended up losing his interest on it upon it being stolen by a snake.

He, who had become a Heroic Spirit, possesses no wish to entrust upon the Holy Grail. To begin with, be it the Holy Grail or Noble Phantasm, he considers all things in creation to be his possession; based on that, the reason he responds to the Holy Grail summons is to punish as a king those who scrambles for what is his.

He manifests as an Archer, in possession of the Independent Action Skill; should the Master is someone he has no interest on, he may very well turn against them. Of course, as far as he is concerned even the Master is no more than his attendant, albeit one who would never think of the likes of betrayal.

During Fuyuki’s Fifth Holy Grail War, he had planned to cull the excessively multiplying mankind; however, this is a deliberation caused by taking in the inside of the Holy Grail, “All of the World’s Evil”, incarnated by it, and becoming inclined to modern civilization; quite far off from the neutral Gilgamesh of the age of the gods.


## Dialogue Examples

“Do not make light of me. What manner of hero would I be, if I could not even take in this amount of curse? All the evil of this world? Hah! Bring three times that amount if you wish to dye me with it.
Understood, Saber? Heroes are those who bear responsibility of all human being within their view. --And I had long since bear all of the world.”

“What is a king, if not arrogant!?”

“How dare you-----how dare you, howdareyouhowdareyouhowdareyouhowdareyouhowdareyou …!”

“Fool! I have not even the slightest intention to die...! You stay there until I pull myself out!”

“Thoughts extolling desperation; an agreeable start!”

## Historical Character and Figure

The king of Uruk, a city state of ancient Mesopotamia.

It began with the “Epic of Gilgamesh”, said to be the oldest epic of a hero; he appeared in Mesopotamia ancient tale, and thus is called the king of heroes.

He was a warrior excelling and proficient in handling arms, flushing out youths in the war against other city states while rebelling against the elders. The gods, who heard of the lamentation of the parents who lost their child in the war, grant to him an equal friend, and thereafter they both went on adventures together.

They had made various exploits, such as defeating the monster of the forest Humbaba; however, by the design of Ishtar, whose allure he had severely spurned, he lost his friend and ended up fearing death.

Gilgamesh, who wished for the secret of immortality, went to meet the sage who had lived on since the age of the great flood, Utnapishtim. And although through the sage’s advice he was able to get in his hand the miraculous medicine of immortality, it was eaten by a snake when he had momentarily let his guard down for but a small period of time.

## Character in FGO

Compared to the original works, he plays less of an active role.

In his interludes, in a manner of very much like him, many times he would appraises the Master of whether or not they are worthy of his interest and bestow trials upon them. By his words, “Mankind does not have any value; but the things mankind made does.” Perhaps that belief of his is one of the reason he is quite particular with his treasures.

## Depiction in past works

In two of Fate/stay night routes, he appears in a last boss-like role. In contrast with Saber (Artoria), who was consecutively summoned in the fourth and the fifth war, he stayed as he was as an Archer of the fourth war.


In this work, his ability and personality are of the extreme antithesis of those on the protagonist’s side, and so he is completely on the opposing side. However, in Fate/hollow ataraxia, he reclaims another aspect of his unique way of being as the “King of Heroes”, and then in Fate/Zero his character and true motive was reaffirmed.

In Fate/EXTRA CCC, because he is one of the main Servant of the neutral character protagonist, he is inclined to neither good nor evil, bewitching with his behaviour as a “hero of the age of the gods”. In the short story of Fate/strange fake, he was summoned together with a hero he possesses deep bond with during his live, depicting the figure of his in great joy of their reunion and rematch.

## Related Characters

**Artoria**

That figure of hers, floundering on the ground as she aim (wish) for the unreachable ideal----truly is the only star that can be found above ground.

The star is something beyond reach, be it from the heaven or earth. And so it is beautiful.

**Cu Chulainn**

“At last, I have ascertained why you grate on my nerves so! It is because your way of being as a king is simply directly opposite of mine!”

**Karna**

Having low self-assertion is a fault; however, he see no other fault with Karna. In particular is that golden armor; truly excellent. He dare say he has the second best sense in this world.

**Enkidu**

No comment.

**Ishtar**

“Fuhaha! Let me tell you, goddess! You would be the result if one combine together a swarm of locust, a sandstorm, and the temper of a child!”

## Comment from the Illustrator

The degree of how much his armor is completed already is kinda high, so I can’t really add or take away anything. So the design evolution ends up having no twist whatsoever.

And still he has hell of a presence; as expected from the King of Heroes. (Takeuchi Takashi)
