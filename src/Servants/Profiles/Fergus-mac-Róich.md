## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [B]**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were invoked with a chant of three verses or below. It is difficult to damage Fergus who has this rank of Magical Resistance with Magecraft, even if he was targeted by Great Magecrafts, Ritual Spells and the like.

**Riding: [B]**

It is possible for one to manage most vehicles and beasts. Regarding the Phantasmal Kind however, they are not able to manage them.


## Personal Skills

**Mind’s Eye (True): [A]**

An insight cultivated through discipline and training. One possesses a combat logic to grasp with a presence of mind the state of affairs around themselves and the abilities of the enemies in a predicament, deducing the means of survival left in that situation.

Fergus has this Skill with a high rank because of the anecdote where he perceived that the existence of the “two huge bulls”, which was the reason why the greatest war of Ulster occurred, were really sent in by the gods as the chosen destroyers of Ireland.

**Valour: [A]**

Nullifies mental interferences. In addition, it even has the effect of increasing the damage dealt in hand-to-hand combat.

**Nature of a Rebellious Spirit: [B]**

The temperament to never stay at one location, and also, to never embrace a lord. One is a wandering star that does not have the capacity to be a sovereign, and also, they are not able to find their own sovereign.

Nullifies the effects of Charisma up to Rank B on Fergus.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Caladbolg: The Rainbow Sword

- Rank: A++*
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~40
- Maximum Number of Targets: 300 people

Another name for this is The Spiral Rainbow Sword. An Anti-Army Noble Phantasm that boasts of a high-power and wide-range, making even landscape destruction feasible. In legends, it demonstrated a fearsome power where a shimmering drawn out from a swing of this sword “had cut off three hills.”

It had cut off the tops of the hills by means of “a shimmering from the sword that extended outwards like a rainbow” in the legends, but when wielded as a Noble Phantasm, Caladbolg’s aspect as a landscape destruction weapon has been pronounced. In other words, there is no use in arguing if it is a great attack or not that can break the earth apart. The Great Spin in the Sky of Heaven and Earth.

In later eras, it is said that Caladbolg was the model for the magic swords/sacred swords that many heroes obtained. Also, it is the prototype of Excalibur Galatine.

*The Noble Phantasm is A+ rank in the game profile

# Character

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: ore
- Second Person Pronouns: omae / ○○ (without honorifics for a close companion)
- Third Person Pronouns: aitsu / yakko / ○○-dono / ○○ (without honorifics for a close companion)

## Personality

Big-hearted. A man of broad-mindedness who does not care very much about trivial matters. Often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear. Sincere and humane. To a companion judged to be trustworthy, Fergus has the tolerance to show and share his heaps of generosity with that companion no matter what, even if it happens to be their first meeting. However, he never permits betrayal, and he will not forgive one who does it, even if they are a king. He always keeps the promises he exchanges.

In addition, on the occasion of the “Táin Bó Cúailnge”, referred to as the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle in Celtic Mythology, when Fergus and Cú Chulainn crossed blades in earnest, mostly every other Ulster men had completely ceased into inactivity already due to a curse, so with that being the case (as in the first place, this war itself was also something that began due to Queen Medb’s selfishness), during the time they clashed with each other, Fergus promised to Cú Chulainn that he will ease up to a degree in order to not go too far in killing his defenseless former allies, and he displayed to others the fulfillment of his promises sincerely.

Although he is known as Medb’s lover, Fergus has a legitimate wife too. Moreover, she is a Goddess of the Forests. Fergus usually wears a composed face, but frankly, there is a hidden peerlessness behind it. His sexual desire is excessively too full of vigour, so much that if it was the common woman, that aspect of his needed seven women in a single night to become satisfied, and it is said that only Medb and his wife “can either be, surprisingly enough, just that one person that was okay” for his satisfaction.

## Attitude Towards Master

Fergus comes into contact with the Master as a “comrade-in-arms”. His awareness of the relationship between master and servant is very thin. He recognizes them as a comrade in the conflict called ‘The Quest for the Holy Grail‘, as well as a commanding officer that he should trust. If Cú Chulainn is “a reliable elder brother”, Fergus has numerous words and deeds typical of “a reliable uncle”.

The wish Fergus wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to once again “get along” with his wife and Medb together.” Get along. Together.[1]

## Dialogue Examples

“Very well. It looks like you want to spill your blood!”

“There’s a pleasant moon, and a nice wind is blowing. And then, there’s you. The fact is, just you alone is who I can keep on living for.”

“Those who are brave warriors can eat well, drink well, and rest well at ease.”

“Oh. There’s a fine woman.”

“That’s a splendid Noble Phantasm! If that’s the case, let’s proceed with a match with my Rainbow Sword!”

## Historical Character and Figure

A brave warrior of the Celts/Ulster who is known as a member of the Red Branch Knights. The friend and foster father of Cú Chulainn. A great glutton who is viewed as one with matchless vigour[2], often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear. Even now, the fame of the Hero Fergus as a magnificent brave warrior is being left behind in posterity.

There is also a legend where Fergus was the King of Ulster from the previous generation. According to that, it is said he had temporarily handed over the throne to Conchobar under the condition that Conchobar’s beautiful mother was made into his lover, but Conchobar’s mother, who was overflowing with sinister designs, left Fergus out of the kingship permanently with those designs.

Fergus was formerly a man who established a corner of the Red Branch Knights, but he ran away from the order of knights out of rage at the betrayal of Ulster King Conchobar. During the time when the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle broke out, Fergus took the side of his lover, Queen Medb of Connacht, and displayed his valour. Because Cú Chulainn stayed with Ulster, Fergus was kept from demonstrating his true seriousness in battle, but he still had once reached the point where he was one breath away from slaying King Conchobar.

Due to the pledge (Geis) exchanged with Cú Chulainn at the occasion of this battle, Fergus will almost unconditionally win against Cú Chulainn in the situation where a rematch is done with him. At the time of the second Ulster invasion, because Queen Medb was scheming her revenge against Cú Chulainn, she concluded that “Fergus’ existence will be a nuisance”, and she did not invite Fergus to the battlefield. Afterwards, Fergus was assassinated by the hands of a jealousy-driven King Ailill, Medb’s husband.

## Related Characters

**Cú Chulainn**

His adopted son and friend. If he sees Cú Chulainn, Fergus will slap his shoulder with great joy and roar with laughter.

**Queen Medb**

His lover. His mistress. A reunion would be a delight, the past is something to yearn for. And then, Fergus will decide to utter words like a filthy old man for a moment. Although Medb will strike back at ease with some leeway for him…

**Scáthach**

A peerless beautiful woman. A teacher. So, Fergus holds a thought of ‘Hey, I want to request you for the night’, but he understands that it is impossible.

**Beautiful Female Servants**

Fergus basically does not want to speak words and do deeds that will appear to disturb his position as the uncle who will become reliable for others, but towards adult women, the indication of “I want to request you as my companion for the night” is oozing. Given that children are targets of protection, he does not have much of an interest in those with an outward appearance of the very young-looking type.

## Comment from the Illustrator

Since Fergus had a minor specification in relation to his face and figure, it resulted in the present impression where he does not become puzzled much. They are very easy to draw. His eyes, I mean. His equipment had been proceeding with a design similar to Cú Chulainn (Prototype)’s at first, but when I sent in a scribble of him wearing a western school uniform in the middle of the process, it grew into a discussion of ‘Let’s have him wear something where he’s like the leader of a group of juvenile delinquents’, and it settled down into the current design. It got to now where I cannot come up with anything for his figure except for this half-naked style, huh? (B-suke)

## TL Notes

[1] – Fergus essentially wants to do a threesome with both his wife and Medb.
[2] – Can also be expressed as ‘with endless sexual stamina.‘
