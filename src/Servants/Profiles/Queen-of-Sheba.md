## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Three Enigmas (Three Enigmas)

- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm

Djinn triplets obedient to the Queen appear and present difficult (physical) challenges to the enemy.

The three djinns are named *Achat*, *Shtayim*, and *Shalosh*, respectively.

Once, the Queen visited Jerusalem carrying a large amount of presents, in an attempt to receive wisdom from the notoriously wise Solomon. Solomon completely saw through the three enigmas meant to test him, and the Queen was impressed by Jerusalem’s prosperity. The Queen exchanged gifts with Solomon, then returned to her land.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First-person pronoun: watashi
- Second-person pronoun: anata
- Third-person pronoun: kare/kanojo/minasan

## Personality

An optimist with a calm and carefree demeanor. Except she’s very predatory when it comes to money.

She remembers clearly what people said ages ago and brings that up again at the most critical moments.

**Likes:**

Obtaining things for a low price and parting with them for a large sum (this is not exclusively about commercial products).Pretty bottles of perfume. Dromedaries.

**Dislikes:**

Treasures (including people of talent) gathering dust in storehouses.

Predicting the future of people close to her. Bactrian camels.

## Attitude Towards Master

When dealing with her Master, she’s fully respectful of the relationship in their contract and finds this very refreshing.

If their deepening bonds eventually cause any changes in the Queen’s heart, those will be too minor to be noticed.

## Dialogue Examples

“Would you enjoy this riddle of mine?”

“My djinns, time to shine.”

“Very well appraised ☆”

“I’ll not allow bilk or pocketing!”

“Sorry, I have zero interest in something no one is willing to buy…”

“Yes, yes, yes, please. I would lo~ove to raise some camels in Chaldea. Camels are cute, you know~~? Camels are scary as HELL if anger them, you know~~?”

“Hiwawawa… HEY! The Touch Fluffy Tail Hours are about to end, understood?”

“OK, Dollarcent~ ♪”

## Historical Character and Figure

She appears in the Old Testament (Book of Kings), New Testament, and other sources.

A queen full of mystery, governing the Sheba Kingdom, south of Jerusalem. However, there’s not a single piece of evidence proving the existence of the kingdom or its queen.

In Ethiopia, East Africa, there is a splendorous national foundation myth saying that the Queen married Solomon and became the mother to the country’s first emperor.

With her existence being as unclear as a mirage, many records describe the Queen of Sheba as peerless beauty, comparable even to the majestic figure of King Solomon.

While her beauty is unquestionable, something about her feels vaguely unfortunate for some reason… and you know very well what this reason is. She wants a thriving business first and foremost. She’s counts every penny, not allowing any pointless expense. She very much lives and breathes money, treasure, business connection, and get-rich-quick schemes. But despite all this, you must keep in mind that it’s very possible that her conduct is a farce, an act being put on by someone who gazed at the distant future.

Also, many regions have legends about her having an inhuman figure. Arabians said “the Queen had furry legs and donkey hooves”, Southern French said “her feet were webbed like a goose’s”, etc.

The correct version is the story that says that she is the daughter of a djinn woman and a human man. It’s also believed that the Queen possesses a shapeshifter’s power to have a variety of appearances, as if she were a light-refracting lens.

The New Testament (Gospels of Matthew and Luke) also says this: “The queen of the south will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here.”1

## Character in FGO

She has a self-deprecating side regarding how, contrary to her glamorous legends, her own past was nothing but modest. And she strongly values modest stories of everyday life.

She has powers of future precognition, originated from her djinn bloodline. It’s implied that her meeting with Solomon in the legends was actually an intense mentally draining Clairvoyance vs Clairvoyance battle, where they would go through the three enigmas adapting to what was becoming settled as the future and the past.

## Standard Weapons

She takes an incense burner made of gold to scatter incense smoke and manipulate it.

## Comments from the Djinns:

**Shtayim:** When her shopping adds to 889 yen, she gives the cashier 1444 yen without a word.

**Shalosh:** She sleeps in camel pantaloons.

## Comment from the Illustrator

I am Itsuwa Katou, the character designer. I remember well putting a lot of energy into this design, in gratitude to my permission to add animal years and horns right in my very first work here. There’s something of an origin story to my little djinns. At first, I considered doing them in a more “genie of the lamp” style, but I couldn’t due to circumstances including an already released character doing exactly that. This lead to me just drawing whatever I wanted and those getting used as they were. It’s very pleasant to see than in action as a real Noble Phantasm. (Itsuwa Katou)
