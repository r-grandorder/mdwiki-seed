## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: D**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done in one step (a Single Action). A Magical Resistance of the same degree as an amulet that rejects Magical Energy.

**Independent Action: A+**

It is possible to act even with the absence of one’s Master.

## Personal Skills

**Magic Bullet Shooter: EX**

The ability to fire magic bullets to shoot down targets and even overcome any kind of obstacle.

It is actually a Skill not from Moriarty, but from Der Freischütz.

**The End of the Spider Thread: A++**

The faculty to scheme evil. Disrupting order, contaminating goodness, and not causing fate and punishment to face towards oneself. Like a web made by a spider, the evil schemes capture the opponents and causes them to fall.

**Charisma of a Wicked Intellectual: A**

A tremendous Charisma owned not by one who manages a state, but only by one who is at the top of an evil organization.

With Moriarty’s evil Charisma at the Rank of A, it is even feasible for him to control not just the United Kingdom, but the whole world from the shadows.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# The Dynamics of an Asteroid: The Ultimate Crime

* Rank: A+
* Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
* Range: 1~99
* Maximum Number of Targets: 100 people

The Noble Phantasm that embodies the “planetary destruction” Moriarty aims for. Because he was summoned as a Servant, it is being confined to “Anti-Army”, but if its power is amplified, its range can extend to “Anti-City”, “Anti-Country”. Piercing the earth with an enormous pile bunker, everything is swallowed up by the resulting fissures in the ground.

In the Shinjuku Chapter, by using this Noble Phantasm to its greatest extent, it took another step closer to achieving the destruction of the Protagonist and the planet.

# Character

## Pronouns

* First Person Pronoun: watashi
* Second Person Pronoun: kimi
* Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo

## Personality

The dignified appearance of that charismatic evil person is so overwhelming, those with a rebellious spirit will lose their feelings of wanting to defy him in his presence. As a philosopher and a mathematician, Moriarty thinks of chaos as something “good”. Even though he was summoned as a Servant, due to the Skill “The End of the Spider Thread”, he has become a being that one must always be careful around.

Another person, Max, who is the protagonist in “Der Freischütz”, has been completely taken into Moriarty’s existence, and in relation to Moriarty’s personality, the fusion had practically no effect on it. At best, it is to the degree of “I have become wanting to fire guns.”

## Attitude Towards Master

Towards the Master, Moriarty comes into contact with them as a relatively pleasant grandfather. Also, he occasionally whispers evil and will try to lead the Master into it. Nevertheless, if they do not give in (deepen their bond with him), Moriarty will display his mettle for the Master and will try to be helpful to them while still being evil.

## Dialogue Examples

* “You thought it was a beautiful girl? Sorry to disappoint you! Fooor it was an old man of around fifty who rescued you, you who fell from the sky!”
* “My name is Moriarty. James Moriarty. What you are thinking about, as well as your convictions, I understand them all… Joking!”
* “Come now, it is time to fall into Hell! Master!”
* “Is it probably no use? If it is true that a conclusion can be reached where it is possible, then I have no choice but to verify it after. The destruction of the world… let me prove it.”
* “True Name blocked, pseudo-Noble Phantasm deployed… It is time for punishment!
* … Magnificent! The world is being filled with destruction! AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”

## Historical Character and Figure

James Moriarty is viewed as Sherlock Holmes’ rival and the greatest and strongest villain that appeared in the Sherlock Holmes Series.

Even despite the stories he appeared in only amounting to three works, and moreover, the circumstances of those appearances were mostly hearsays, Moriarty’s name sparkles with brilliance in the history of mystery as a charismatic evil person.

In addition, although the Holmes Series itself is a collection of works that should be called the pioneer of every “mystery”, it could perhaps be said that Moriarty is also the fundamental being for a charismatic criminal that “plans crimes without receiving any blame for those crimes.”

Moriarty’s public appearance is a mathematician/teacher. However, one of the treatises written by him, “The Dynamics of an Asteroid”, has been buried in the dark without almost ever appearing on the surface, and Isaac Asimov thought of an idea for that and wrote “The Ultimate Crime”, a short story in the Black Widowers Series.

Also, it is highly likely that Holmes intentionally circulated misinformation to have Moriarty’s image and appearance differ from the one in the original texts.

“Although personally, I just think that is what they call harassment, IS IT NOT?!”

## Character in FGO

A charismatic evil person.


## Standard Weapons

Super-Excessively Armed Multipurpose Coffin – Reichenbach.

Moriarty boasts that “Because he died at that place, it is fitting to drag this coffin along.” Unexpectedly, it is a formidable weapon equipped with multiple heavy weapons such as a missile launcher and a light machine gun. Its ammunition is infinite as well, but the drawbacks are that it is massive and it has an effect on his poor back.

## Related Characters

**Sherlock Holmes**

As everyone knows, Moriarty’s ultimate rival. However, despite Moriarty being summoned as a man of around fifty, Holmes does not really assent to that for he is obviously youthful.

Because he is being imposed a destiny called————‘He will always be defeated when doing battle against Holmes head-on’, Moriarty joined forces with the Demon God Pillar Baal in order to overturn that.

Thereafter the Shinjuku Phantom Spirit Incident, it is said that when Chaldea’s Holmes is being inattentive, Moriarty would be slapping victory declaration papers on Chaldea’s doors and hallways, and the Protagonist and Mash would be peeling them off while sighing.

**Frankenstein**

Due to being called Papa, something inside Moriarty’s brain sparked, his evil influence was turned inside out, and he shows off a very papa-like manner with a flower circle above his head, as if he was really called a Papa. Fortunately, since Frankenstein has a good sense in itself, Moriarty regains his true character whenever she hits him hard at a time where he behaved recklessly.

**Henry Jekyll**

While alive, Moriarty awakened Mr. Hyde, who is called evil, by setting a trap. He does not even consider that fragment evil. Since he considers it as something like, “Because, for him to exist individually, that in itself is his achievement.” Because it looks like he will be killed if he puts that into words, he has been refraining from doing so.

Although Moriarty utters, “I want to get along with him”, this is relatively what he really thinks. Because after all is said and done, the works he sent out at a whim will be playing an active role for the sake of the world.

**Avenger of Shinjuku**

On the occasion of the Shinjuku Phantom Spirit Incident, Baal, who had acted as Archer of Shinjuku, conducted a remodelling of Phantom Spirits as he desired. For that reason, concerning that relatively, a terribly incalculable chimera had been completely finished, Moriarty secretly puts a distance between himself and Avenger of Shinjuku as a matter of fact.

“DANGEROUS, very scary!”

## Comment from the Illustrator

I was certainly not expecting that it would result in this many characters so far, like this suspicious old man who’s being given all sorts of nicknames such as Shincha[1], Shinjuku Ojisan and Around 50. His image that was being depicted at the time was cold-hearted and unjust, and he was designed with a calculating and intellectual image, but I’m taking my hat off to Mr. Writer who broke through that stereotype and obliged to write him as who he’s now fascinatingly! Truly amazing! Design-wise, the Ulysses butterflies are a metaphor for a frail victim and the shedding of a disguise during metamorphosis, the chameleon is a metaphor for camouflage, and the spiderweb in the background is a metaphor for a mastermind manipulating crimes from the center; a metaphorical old man. In addition, he’s also an old man whose True Name being hidden was not functioning very well for him. I can say it at last, but I came up with and depicted the orientation and pose in the drawings of Moriarty’s standing pose so that it turns out to be the opposite to Holmes’. (Honjou Raita)

# Gray Collar Costume

I challenged myself in wanting to draw a version of Moriaty with his hair down lol. This man has the mysterious character trait where he even puts on whatever kind of clothes he has and wears them in his own style, which is convenient for me, but I wonder what does he want, so even I can’t understand his motives… I noticed that after I finished drawing him, his standing posture has become a ballroom dancing pose. (Honjou Raita)

## Translator's Notes:

[1] – Shincha is a combination of Shin from Shinjuku and Cha from Archer (Aacha in Romaji). Some people call Moriarty “New Tea” because of that (Shin = New, Cha = Tea).
