## Class Skills

**Surfing: [A]**
A subclass of the Riding Skill. If it is at Rank A, it is possible for one to manage most surfboards.

**Magical Resistance: [B]**
Nullifies Magecraft spells that were invoked with a chant of three verses or below. It is difficult to damage Mordred who has this rank of Magical Resistance with Magecraft, even if she was targeted by Great Magecrafts, Ritual Spells and the like.

## Personal Skills

**Cerulean Ride: [A]**

A peculiar Skill for the objective of riding even on a legendary great wave like the “Big Wednesday”. Regardless of the quality of the surfboard, one can ride across every wave.

**Rodeo Flip: [A+]**

A highly difficult surfing technique that does exist.
Because Miss Mo frequently uses this as an attack, it has been extraordinarily sublimated as a Skill.

**Endless Summer: [B]**

Miss Mo is in a summer mood at all times.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Prydwen Tube Riding: The Great Kingly Mood of Reigning in Surging Waves!
- Rank: A
- Classification: Anti-Wave Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~5
- Maximum Number of Targets: 10 people

Pulls off a tube riding (that move in which one rides through the gap within the wave) – which boasts a top-class difficulty level among surfing techniques – by means of Prydwen. The opponents will die. Why? How?

Perhaps, one can think that a wave occurring because of Mordred riding Prydwen might be due to her getting into a condition similar to a kind of “Magical Burst” Skill, but they have a feeling that it is no more than a drawback when taking into consideration of that conjecture.

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronoun: ore
Second Person Pronouns: omae / kisama
Third Person Pronoun: aitsu

## Personality

Her spirits are overwhelmingly higher than the usual Mordred, so it is easy to catch sight of her riding.

## Attitude Towards Master

Given that she removed both her armour and sword now, Mordred is not being a slave to the restraints of being a knight. As for Mordred herself, she intends to enjoy this one summer to her heart’s content.

## Dialogue Examples

“Howdy, Master! Heeh, I came to play! Ah, do keep this a secret from Father! This board… I took it out secretly!”

“Alrighty then! I can tell you that the feeling of ignoring the King’s orders is the best! I’m just about to go back to the sea and ride on the waves again as well!”

“Master, the south wind is blowing. This is the sea’s once in a lifetime rampage. So, let’s go surfing together. Yeah, even if this body vanishes someday, this is unforgettable, since it’s something I don’t want to forget.”

## Historical Character and Figure

It is no different from the original Mordred’s.

## Character in FGO

Since it’s the summer, the cute Miss Mo possesses an excitement on the high side! She’s sort of getting into the mood. Well, it’s nice that a childhood friend randomly turned up and jumped into the veranda near your personal space while being all friendly, right?! Isn’t that right?!

… Because half of Mordred’s life was mostly in relation to Britain and the Knight King, it is like Mordred as an individual does not exist, so to speak. Concerning her who was born, raised and fought for the sake of killing the Knight King, it is even possible to say that this situation happens to be the first vacation of her life. As the Master is patient, they want to show off to her what a vacation can be.

Mordred will not get tired of it. Just by seeing her rich facial expressions, it seems summer and the like will pass by in the blink of an eye.

## Standard Weapons

A surfboard (Prydwen).

## Related Characters

**Knights of the Round Table**

“Oh shut up; is there an objection in taking a leave of absence for a vacation?”

**Servants of the Knight King Group**

“Ah, uhhh… Hey, this Prydwen is, in other words, uh… an equipment rental… I’m off to eliminate some savage tribes!”

**Anne Bonny & Mary Read**

Putting aside the female melon monster, there was Mary of who Miss Mo holds a little strange affinity with.


## Comment from the Illustrator

There are a few… swimsuit… lines. Wonderful! Though I was not sure whether I thought about that or not since for a summer event, swimsuits have a splendour to them, so I enjoyed drawing them. I’m healed at a white beach…
A point I figured out is that, because the event moves forward from its initial state, there’s the matter of keeping the circumstances of wearing a straight swimsuit from the start. Fortunately, I felt like opening up a new side of Sir Mordred. Hey, although I’m saying this in the confusion of the moment, that being the case, I’m also waiting for a request to draw a swimsuit for a male Servant! Because!
