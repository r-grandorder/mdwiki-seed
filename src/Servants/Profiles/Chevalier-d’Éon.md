## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [C]**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done with a chant of two verses or below. Cannot defend against large-scale Magecraft such as Great Magecrafts and Ritual Spells.

**Riding: [B]**

It is possible for one to manage most vehicles and beasts. Regarding the Phantasmal Kind however, they are not able to manage them.

## Personal Skills

**Beautiful Looks: [C]**

Coupled with their attire, one is endowed with a beauty that makes it difficult for others to identify their gender as either male or female due to a special aura (and not because of their figure). Functions as a plus modifier for one’s checks at the time of having negotiations with either men or women. Also, all effects that attempt to target a specific gender are disregarded against them.

**Self-Suggestion: [A]**

A powerful suggestion that makes oneself as its target. One possesses a high defensive efficacy against the effects of Magecrafts/Skills/Noble Phantasms that exert influence on the mind.

D’Éon freely uses this Skill, perfectly conducting him/herself as a man at times, and as a woman at times. At times, even his/her own body is made to change————

**Mind’s Eye (True): [C]**

An insight cultivated through discipline and training. One possesses a combat logic to grasp with a presence of mind the state of affairs around themselves and the abilities of the enemies in a predicament, deducing the means of survival left in that situation.

D’Éon has this Skill because of his/her experience where he/she continued to act as a spy in foreign countries. It is this explanation that said person is not just merely cute.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Fleur-de-Lis: The Sword Dance that Scatters Lily Petals

- Rank: C
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~2
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

Fleur-de-Lis (Lily Flower). A beautiful sword dance that charms the beholder. D’Éon’s way of life where he/she continued to accomplish his/her objectives while many men and women were led astray by him/her has been sublimated into this Noble Phantasm.

Within the lily petals – which symbolizes the French Royal Authority – that are scattering into the surroundings, by vividly dancing while wielding his/her sword, d’Éon fascinates his/her target, causing the target’s Strength/Constitution/Agility Parameters to be lowered, and d’Éon drives a deadly sword thrust into his/her target during that opening. A mental attack + physical attack combination. The physical damage only occurs once at the time of the Noble Phantasm’s invocation, but the Fascination Status Effect persists for a while longer. Magical Energy consumption is also low, so it is an extremely easy-to-use Noble Phantasm.

# Fleur-de-Lis: The Gorgeous Splendour that Blooms Lily Petals

- Rank: C
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~30
- Maximum Number of Targets: 50 people

Fleur-de-Lis (Lily Flower). Beautiful sword dance Version 2 that charms the beholders. Its reading is the same as “~that Scatters Lily Petals”. D’Éon’s way of life where he/she continued to accomplish his/her objectives while many men and women were led astray by him/her has been sublimated into this Noble Phantasm. This is the enhanced version.

This sword dance causes a fully bloomed lily – which symbolizes the French Royal Authority – to rise to the surface, fascinating the enemy camp all at once and causing the targets’ Strength/Constitution/Agility Parameters to be lowered for a while. Furthermore, if they do not succeed in their Luck Checks, they will become unable to act for a period of 1 turn. There is no Damage Effect for this version.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: watashi
- Second Person Pronoun: kimi
- Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo, etc.

## Personality

The pure and unselfish Knight of the White Lily. Towards his/her missions, d’Éon is earnest to the point of being very stern, and he/she will occasionally not hesitate where even if it will cause a scene, he/she will feel obliged to choose a ruthless conduct to act upon. On the other hand, he/she has a gentle nature at times of peace. The likes of an expression that shows him/her being hard at work in domestic chores while he/she is looking forward to afternoon teatime can probably be seen too.

The loyalty d’Éon devoted to the French Royal Family is truly everlasting, and even if he/she materializes as a Servant, that will never change. As a Heroic Spirit related to the Royal Family, he/she will surely display the state of his/her loyalty that had remained changeless since when he/she was alive. For example, even if the White Lily of the Royal Family has been lost, as long as France exists in the world, d’Éon will take his/her sword into his/her hand without any doubt. All for the sake of guarding France and the world.

## Attitude Towards Master

In the case that he/she is summoned in a normal Holy Grail War, depending on the position of his/her Master, a situation where d’Éon revolts against them could happen should his/her Master be “someone who opposes France”. On the contrary, it seems d’Éon will offer his/her clear allegiance to a subject who is closely connected to France or the French Royal Family.

Whether he/she is a Heroic Spirit or a human being, and whether his/her body is a man’s or a woman’s, there is only one path for d’Éon to take. To continue to be the Knight of the White Lily. For France, for the Royal Family, and for the Master who tries to save the world (as that will lead to the matter of protecting the present France), d’Éon shall continue to offer his/her own sword.

## Dialogue Examples

“I am the Chevalier d’Éon. The Knight of the White Lily————who shall protect you and the French Royal Family!”

“For you, my pride and love.”

“I will always go with you. Come, let us save France and the world!”

“A dress? I happened to wear those in the olden days when I did things like attending a ball as a “woman”, but… now that I carry a sword in my hand, I wonder…”

“Hey, I… can become either a man or a woman. That is who I, the Chevalier d’Éon de Beaumont, am.”

## Historical Character and Figure

Charles Geneviève d’Éon de Beaumont. A figure of the 18th~19th Century. A legendary figure who was either talked about as a man who was a woman, or a woman who was a man. A swordsman and writer accomplished in both the military and literary arts. D’Éon left behind as many meritorious services as possible in his/her career, such as playing an active role as a spy of the secret channels that conducted themselves against many of the world’s major powers, a French plenipotentiary minister, a commanding officer of a dragoon regiment, and so forth.

It is said that, despite having dressed formally and behaved like a man, d’Éon was endowed with such good looks to the extent that he/she can be called an innocent pretty girl. In fact, before becoming an adult, he/she agreed to wear a dress, gathering rumours among high society that d’Éon is a “beautiful girl”, and later on as an adult, when he/she infiltrated the Russian Empire for an objective regarding his/her secret mission, d’Éon even interacted with the Russian Empress as Mademoiselle Lia de Beaumont, leaving behind an anecdote where his/her beauty was praised by the Empress and her servants.

In later years, a secret was publicly revealed————d’Éon was not a man, but a woman. Consistently thereafter, he/she spent the days as a woman, and it is said that d’Éon was given a dress for “a female knight more suited as a folding fan than a sword” by Marie Antoinette, who was the French Queen at that time.

Born as a female, brought up as a girl, grew up to be a man, and serving the Royal Family————D’Éon speaks of his/her own life as such. There is also an anecdote where d’Éon was definitely raised up as a girl in his/her early childhood and was then raised up as a man thereafter his/her childhood. The truth is, was he a woman, or was he a man? His/her way of life, in which even the opinion of the doctor who performed the examination of his/her body after his/her death was divided into two, is full of beautiful and mysterious glamour, similarly like the impressions he/she kept on giving off to the many men and women around him/her. Therefore, Charles Geneviève d’Éon, as a Heroic Spirit in “Fate/Grand Order”, has got the figure of “a beautiful woman disguising herself as a man” as the form that symbolizes his/her own life.

## Standard Weapons

A sabre. A one-handed sword. D’Éon views Anti-Personnel combat by means of fencing as his/her forte.

## Related Characters

**Marie Antoinette**

A companion who d’Éon ought to devote his/her loyalty to. Marie is also his/her acquaintance from when they were both alive as well as naturally his/her master. D’Éon loves her. He/she wants to have tea together with Marie. Though sometimes, her smile is awfully scary.

**Amadeus**

A person closely connected with d’Éon’s master, Marie Antoinette. Although he/she knows in his/her head that Amadeus is a musical prodigy he/she should respect and love, d’Éon is fairly poor at doing that. “What a perverted devil… Why do you continue to treat me as a friend…? If you were at least a French citizen…”

**Sanson**

Although Sanson is a French citizen and a person of a family lineage that continued to pledge their allegiance to the Royal Family for generations, he is also the companion who dyed the demise of the White Lily in blood. A subject who d’Éon harbours love and hate for and one who he/she finds hard to cut off from. Someone difficult to deal with. However, if it is the case that Marie forgives Sanson, then it is not something d’Éon can raise an objection to…

**Robespierre**

Although Robespierre is a bitter enemy of the Royal Family, d’Éon recognizes that————he is also a person who was concerned about the future of France. A subject of his/her love and hate similarly like Sanson. D’Éon has mixed feelings about Robespierre.

## Comment from the Illustrator

Since the first rough draft, I wandered off course, which felt like I was swiftly running the wrong way with all my energy, but after receiving advice from Mr. Takeuchi, I was able to correct my course somehow. At first, it was more blatant that d’Éon was a woman, but as I was doing adjustments on him/her, he/she settled down into a considerably more androgynous state. On the contrary, I should have reflected his/her Strength A stat more in his/her outward appearance, huh… Even when he/she appears in this way, his/her Second Stage that is inlaid with lily motifs is a favourite of mine. (Moriyama Daisuke)

## TL Notes

D’Éon has a 3rd version of his/her Noble Phantasm. As seen in Agartha, it’s called “Fleur-de-Lis: The Profusion of a Hundred Flowers that Flutters Lily Petals”, which is a more potent version of his/her 2nd Noble Phantasm. It’s a hidden Noble Phantasm that, by releasing all the Magical Energy in his/her body, causes lilies to dance for however long d’Éon wishes them to in order to fascinate his/her enemies. Compared to his/her 2nd Noble Phantasm’s maximum number of targets being fifty people, this version can target a hundred or even a thousand people, creating just enough dancing lilies to potentially affect everyone in an enemy camp regardless of their number.
