## Class Skills

**Territory Creation: [B]**

A magus' ability to create a terrain that is advantageous to themselves.

He can create a territory adapting his master's Noble Phantasm, which is a 'gate'. However this seems to be something he keeps secret, since were he to use it, his master would come to attack him shouting "you're a rip-off, you fool!".

**Divinity: [B]**

Due to being the son of the sun god Lugh, Cu Chulainn possesses high divinity.

## Personal Skills

**Rune Magecraft: [A]**

The possession of the norse rune magecraft he received from Scathach.

Due to being summoned as a Caster, his rank in this skill is higher than as a Lancer.

He can produce powerful and varied effects by using different runes. Outside of offensive runes, he can also produce effects such as giving himself the Magic Resistance and Clairvoyance skills, as well as raising his stats to A, etc. These effects are temporary and he cannot use many of them at once.

**Disengage: [C]**

The ability to escape from battle.

He can return disadvantageous battle conditions to their initial form.

**Protection from Arrows: [A]**

A skill that protects him from projectile attacks.


## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Wicker Man - Cage of Scorching, Consuming Flames

- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Army
- Range: 1~50
- Maximum Targets: 100

Wicker Man. It materializes a giant made from small tree branches. The giant is covered in flames, and attacks its target with powerful fire and heat damage.

The torso of the giant functions as a cage, usually there would be sacrifice trapped inside. However, when materializing as a Noble Phantasm, the giant does not receive a sacrifice, and instead unleashes his fury against the gods while seeking one.

This isn't a secret rune technique, but rather a Noble Phantasm representative of the celt druids given to Cu Chulainn, as he's summoned as a celt magus who controls fire.

# Ochd Deug Odin - Seal of the Great God

- Rank: A
- Type: Anti-Fortress
- Range: 1~80
- Maximum Targets: 500

Ochd Deug Odin. In modern terminology, it'd be called Matrix Wodan. It is a Noble Phantasm activated by chanting its true name and using all 18 primordial runes obtained from Scathach at the same time. The power of the rune possessed by the great Odin is released temporarily and deals inmense magic damage to the enemy camp. It also removes all buff effects from enemies, and reduces all their stats by 1 rank. In case of the enemy possessing passive NPs, these are cancelled for one or two turns.

An extremely powerful ultimate attack that is not utilized in FGO.

It's possible that usage restrictions could be set up by Odin, but the details will be left unknown here.

# Character

## Personality

Basically the same person as the Cu from Fate/Stay Night.

There isn't a big change in his personality.

Even if his abilities and equipment change, there's no mistake that this is the same person. Though Cu himself seems to find this role a bit difficult and sometimes mutters something like ' this doesn't feel right '.

## Attitude Towards Master

He doesn't really talk about his wish for the grail. If he were pressed to say it it'd be something like 'I want my spear', but of course that's not the goal with which he's manifested.

Having been summoned as a Caster, it seems he's taken it upon himself to act as a guide. Not as a true druid, but rather just something temporary...

As long as they're together, he will continue to shine a light on his Master's path.

## Dialogue Examples

"Woah. So I'm a Caster this time, huh...Oh it's you. Have we met before?"

"Well, I'll look forward to your work as a Master"

"The grail, huh...That thing and I have been linked for a while."

"Good work. I did pretty good on my burning too, huh?"

"I'd like to try being summoned as a Saber some time."


## Biography:

A hero from Celtic, Ulster legend.

A member of the Knights of the Red Branch and the strongest warrior in Ulster. A hero who received who used the demonic spear obtained from Scathach, ruler of the Land of Shadows, to gain fame, and also used the runes given to him by his master.

Unlike his Lancer self, his Caster version manifests as a user of diverse magecraft that inflicts pain upon his enemies with them. Apparently he uses the Ansuz rune for his fire attacks.

## Standard Weapons

Long-range attacks with runes. The Ansuz rune materializes in the air when he uses fire attacks.

He can also fight at close range with his weapons. In this case, he temporarily raises his STR stat to A and fights with his oak staff or sword.

He doesn't use any metal as armor.

## Miscellaneous

The same person as the Cu from FSN.

Due to his different class, his appearance also changed. He can change his hairstyle. He does not use metal armor. (Hard armor isn't necessarily unallowed. Even if it's not metal, he can still use something made from ceramic or bone.)

## Comment from the Illustrator

While I looked up “druids are…” and kept putting together this and that it became a somewhat sexy costume (chest). The original plan was white×orange colors, but since they weren’t Cú Chulainn-like I changed them to the current colors. After that the regular lines went in. It would make me happy if I was able to emphasize the aspect of him being different from when he’s a Lancer. (Mata)
