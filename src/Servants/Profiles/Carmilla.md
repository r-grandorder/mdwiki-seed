## Class Skills

**Presence Concealment: [D]**

A low rank of Presence Concealment that is unbecoming for an Assassin. It is at a level where if it is another Servant, they can sense one’s presence at once.

Carmilla’s territory was vast, and therefore, her murders were not discovered for a long time.

## Personal Skills

**Torture Techniques: [A]**

Plus modifiers are added to attacks when making use of torture devices. Because it strengthens bloodshed and agony, further damage continues to be added for a while after the usual damage is dealt.

Although the Skill is of the same rank, Carmilla has accumulated far more experience since the time when she was young.

**Bloodsucking: [C]**

A recovery by bathing in blood. Although it is close to a wrong impression, Carmilla’s skin has certainly rejuvenated.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Phantom Maiden: The Phantasmal Iron Maiden

- Rank: C
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

A famous torture tool said to have been used by Elizabeth Báthory… Although, as a result of an investigation that spanned over a long period of time, investigators had come to the conclusion that it did not exist. Nonetheless, there are many who believe in the existence of this torture device, so it has been esteemed as an exquisite Noble Phantasm that kills innocent maidens while they are filled with fear.

Floating above Carmilla’s head, screams of her target are heard while the iron maiden is filled with their blood the moment it closes shut. It is both a recovery of health for Carmilla and an attack being used together. In the case of it being used against female Servants, damage increases.

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: watashi
- Second Person Pronouns: anata / anata [only to females]
- Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo

## Personality

Every factor of her life, such as her livelihood as a noble that spanned over many years, her contempt towards humans except for those who are her fellow blood relatives due to being hardened by them, and so forth, all pushed the former Elizabeth into a killer who seeks the bizarre. Haughty, proud, and conceitful, Carmilla’s body is coiled around with every vanity; it is like sulfuric acid had turned into a human form. If one touches Carmilla, all fine things will be inflamed immediately. And yet, stupidity exists at her root————If one puts it in another way, it is even possible to say that Carmilla has a faint goodness within her that is just on the verge of barely stopping her audacity.

## Attitude Towards Master

Naturally, Carmilla is clearly evil. She will betray her Master, and she will even embrace the recognition of being called a traitor. But still, even if she does not go so far as… to serve them, if it is probably a Master with a bottomless goodness, one who is aware of, and furthermore, accepts her past, in that case, she will appear to become willingly cooperative.

## Dialogue Examples

“You make a pleasant cry. If you don’t mind, can you let me hear more of it when we return to the castle?”

“I hate myself. Abhor myself. Listen, as a matter of fact… I’m sure you’ll also hear the same answer if you ask ‘me’.”

“… Not going to touch me?”

## Historical Character and Figure

Elizabeth Báthory’s figure changed into the “Blood Countess” due to her legend being circulated. Unlike Elizabeth, there is still room for correction in Carmilla (although there is no room for forgiveness); a cruel existence through and through. Unmistakably an Anti-Hero, if circumstances originally allowed Carmilla to be summoned, it would probably be by a dark killer on the same level as her.

The Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu wrote “Carmilla” in the year 1872. Languid, the female vampire Carmilla possesses a charming beauty in some respects, and this novel provided a great influence for Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” as well.

And one can conclude that the person who became the model for Carmilla is her————Elizabeth Báthory. Elizabeth Báthory has anecdotes of giving somebody the impression of her as a fine sovereign, although even if meagre, but Carmilla’s current state tore off that influence. Elizabeth is obtaining some power of the Dragon Kind due to her Innocent Monster Skill, but even that was lost due to Carmilla taking the form of a complete vampire.

Furthermore, Elizabeth hates that she is merging with Carmilla despite being an identical existence. Elizabeth thinks “I musn’t become like her”, and if it is viewed from Carmilla’s perspective, Elizabeth is the figure of her past glorifying her absolutely intolerable youth. To speak of this simply, if it is viewed from Elizabeth’s side, it is “Such an incomplete thing that can’t grow accustomed to being that sort of idol is not my future self and should just drop dead!!”, and if it is viewed from Carmilla’s side, it is “My former self who wonders if she should wake up or not from her FOOLISH dream that seemingly settles on a dark history such as being an idol should just go to hell!!”

**Elizabeth**

Needless to say.

**Vlad III**

“You made me laugh at you when you’re doing things such as denying vampires. Isn’t it thanks to that vampire that you’re here?”

## Comment from the Illustrator

Since the iron maiden was set as her Noble Phantasm, I designed Carmilla in a sadistic image to match up with that. In her Final Ascension, I chose a scene that emphasizes insanity and inhumanity. It was very difficult to make her crinoline-like armour. Given that I love characters that are like a Queen, I delightfully accepted drawing her even though I was going to suffer doing so. (ojoko)
