## Class Skills

**Avenger: [B]**

The rate of NP Generation becomes higher when receiving damage. It is easier for one to accumulate hatred and resentment.

After the result of the Orléans Singularity Correction, Jeanne Alter’s resentment has become a little lighter.

**Oblivion Correction: [A]**

Jeanne Alter’s hatred will never be cleared away, no matter how much time has passed. Even if, she is aware of the things more wonderful than her hatred.

**Self-Restoration (Magical Energy): [A+]**

One’s Magical Energy endlessly surges until their revenge is accomplished. Recovers a minuscule amount of Magical Energy every turn.

Because Jeanne Alter was created by a wish made upon the Holy Grail, the quantity of her Magical Energy recovery is of a higher grade.

## Personal Skills

**Self-Modification: [EX]**

A special grade remodelling done by the Holy Grail. It has completely inverted the holy maiden and has made her fall into the Chaotic Evil alignment.

**The Dragon Witch: [EX]**

A Skill that musters up the fury of the Hundred Years’ War of the Wicked Dragons. Lower-class Dragon Kind members can be placed under Jeanne Alter’s control and are able to be manipulated with a single swing of her flag. Simultaneously, it also serves as a non-standard Riding Skill, making it even possible for her to ride a Dragon Kin through the acquisition of this Skill.

**Ephemeral Dream: [A]**

A lifeform born from illusions because of an individual’s desire. Because she was born from one’s desire, Jeanne Alter possesses a powerful force, but at the same time, she is not permanently approved as a lifeform allowed for existence. After everything is finished, she will quietly start her slumber.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# La Grondement Du Haine: Howl Loudly, O’ Rage of Mine
- Rank: A+
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum Number of Targets: 100 people

La Grondement Du Haine (The Roar of Hatred). The cursed flag possessed by the Jeanne who descended as the Dragon Witch. It stops the enemy’s attack in the same way as Saint Jeanne’s Noble Phantasm, but this Noble Phantasm also swells up that attack, before it reflects it back. Also, its power will increase even more if her allies die, etc. Then, whether it is a slashing attack, a striking attack, or on top of that, a hit by means of a curse, all of it will in the same way be converted into her physical attack power when they are halted by the Noble Phantasm.

The flag can release flames with performance resembling a first-rate Dragon Breath. Furthermore, the stake was stuck into Jeanne Alter’s image. Personally for her, “I was attached to… uh, something jagged… and made of steel, and a harsh impression of it remains with me!”, and this impression allows her to create those kinds of stakes in her image for her own use.

First Person Pronoun: watashi
Second Person Pronouns: anata / anata [only to females] / anta
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / aitsu / are

## Personality

A dark Jeanne d’Arc dyed in a desire for vengeance. Her personality is extremely cruel and stern, and probably a few people would notice the vestiges of her sainthood in there. She has no kindness towards others, and she will become an object of revenge, said to be only at all of mankind. She always harbours distrust even towards her comrades in her surroundings. She believes in God. And yet, faith does not exist in that belief. She will wage war with her companions against God, and she will simply delight in this cause to kill. She has a liking for destruction done to total completion existing within her————she makes the purpose of her life to keep on killing anything that comes her way, all until she uses up all her strength.

## Attitude Towards Master

The particulars of her summoning may be extremely unclear, but Jeanne Alter will not choose to rebel once she is summoned. However, seeing that it is a human Master, she will constantly harbour distrust. Also, when she becomes highly tensed, she will start to laugh fanatically.

## Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Avenger. I came in response to your summons… What’s the matter? What’s with that face? Hurry up, here’s the written contract.”

“For there to be something in this world that can be a match for my hatred… no, that can make up for it… Although it was too late, I wonder if this is even called a miracle… Thank you. Hmph, I didn’t say anything.”

“After how rebellious you can be by not calling me your Master, you said you’re going to be a vengeful woman who calls me, among all other labels, your elder sister!?”

## Historical Character and Figure

Another Jeanne d’Arc, born because of Gilles de Rais (Caster) having wished on the Holy Grail for this kind of Jeanne in the Hundred Years’ War of the Wicked Dragons. As Jeanne lived through her life as a Saint, there is no element that can properly be converted for Alteration. Therefore, Jeanne Alter is purely “a Jeanne d’Arc dreamt of by the people as an avenger”, and properly speaking, there is no capacity to the extent of being able to summon her as a Servant.

However, something once created will not return to nothingness. Jeanne Alter had set a trap on Jeanne d’Arc to work out her plan. By producing an element for Alteration not in the Jeanne of the past, but in the Jeanne as a Servant, she created a core for Jeanne Alter; furthermore, she improved her Saint Graph values through the Counterfeits’ Riot, having publicly transformed into a Servant. Regarding the Counterfeit Heroic Spirits that were summoned on the occasion of the Counterfeits’ Riot, it appears that Jeanne Alter wanted to forget all about their existences except for her owns.

Since she is not denying Jeanne d’Arc already, Jeanne Alter aims to surpass her. Even for her writing practices, she will not fail in being earnest about them every day. And she is steadily going through a little bit of writing already!

## Related Characters

**Jeanne d’Arc**

It goes without saying that Jeanne is a holy maiden. The detestable original of herself. However, since Jeanne Alter perceives her very existence as becoming a pest to Jeanne d’Arc, she enjoys her Chaldea life with an air of smugness… Jeanne d’Arc thinks that sort of Jeanne is a little pleasant, and that should not ever be realized by Jeanne Alter.

**Artoria Alter (Including Santa)**

Someone who is playing the role of something like a destined rival. Jeanne Alter is herself when others are themselves. And then against Artoria Alter, who could think of and come to a clear decision while being evil, she becomes absurdly weak and passive.

**Gilles de Rais (Caster)**

One person who Jeanne Alter has for mental support. Though nowadays, she is going through just a little rebellious phase.

The Servants on the occasion of the Counterfeits’ Riot

“A dark past! That’s a dark past! Just make sure to absolutely not remember that, OK!?”

**Angra Mainyu**

“No way… My senior is so weak…”

**Jeanne d’Arc Alter Santa Lily**

(A gesture of her removing her glasses while trembling and shivering.)

## Comment from the Illustrator

Originally, Jeanne Alter was produced as a simple colour change character and was planned to be implemented as an event distribution Servant, but because everybody who demanded for her was pressing us for her appearance, she got to be reconstructed as an official character. Her shading and a bit of her design differ from the Jeanne Alter that appeared in Chapter 1. Because there is a meaning for her hairstyle in having its braid cut off, there was some resistance in having her hair grow out long for her Third Stage, but I also did this long hairstyle on Jeanne preferably because it was said to be towards a good direction, and hey, it was a good direction to have it be flashy after all.

She was Jeanne Alter (Ruler) at the time of her appearance in the First Chapter. For the development in those days, since it was a time where there was no leeway for us mentally as well as timewise, the only option was to re-use Jeanne’s outfit with a colour change. Be that as it may, given that implementing a character of Jeanne with a colour change in her standing pose is, as one would expect, unattractive, we made sure to turn around the way Jeanne was drawn in the key visuals. Even though she was called an NPC, she was drawn with distorted facial expressions and the like, doing whatever I please without any kind of eagerness, and it was quite a bit of a surprise that many were pleased with that side of her. Nowadays, she became a character totally known for her amusing facial expressions huh? (Takeuchi Takashi)

## TL Notes

Others – The proper French grammar for the Noble Phantasm’s name should be Le Grondement de la Haine.
