## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [C]**

Cancel spells with a chant below two verses. Cannot defend against magecraft on the level of High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals.

**Independent Action: [B]**

The ability to act independently for a short while after being cut off from the Master's mana supply. At Rank B, it is possible to stay in the world for about 2 days without a Master.

## Personal Skills

**Galvanism: [A]**

Unrestricted conversion of bio-electric currents and mana, as well as storing them.
Attacks with no substance to them, such as magic beams, magical winds, magic bullets, are instantly converted into electricity. The absorbed electricity is used by Nikola Tesla to replenish his mana.

**Natural Born Genius: [A]**

A Skill that displays the natural intellect of one who has no equal.
Excluding those inherent to the body (such as Divinity) or ones unique to heroes, the use of most Skills, at a proficiency level of A~B rank, is possible.
Nikola Tesla does not use this Skill much.

**Pioneer of the Stars: [EX]**

A unique skill granted to heroes who became the turning point of human history.
Every stormy voyage and difficult journey turns from "something impossible" into "something that can be realized".
Nikola Tesla, who brought a power that belonged only to the beings from the Age of Gods to Earth and raised the level of civilization of the entire world, possesses a high rank in this skill.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# System・Keraunos: The Legend of Mankind・Advent of Thunder and Lightning
- Rank: EX
- Class: Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~99
- Maximum number of Targets: 400

System・Keraunos.
Something that the great achievements of his lifetime and the mystery from a large number of supernatural myths sublimated into.
The ability to manipulate electromagnetism. It possesses such a might, that people are given the impression as if it was the second coming of the Gods of Lightning and Thunder mentioned in a multitude of myths and legends.
Generally, it launches an attack by the means of electromagnetic projection. The existence of this long-distance attack is what qualifies Nikola Tesla, who's originally not a Heroic Spirit that possess a bow or any sort of shooting weapon, as an Archer.
With the release of its True Name, the surrounding area is destroyed with the 「generation of a limited, artificial fracture in space-time」. It's one hell of an offensive and defensive Noble Phantasm, but its fuel consumption is relatively poor.
It's important to pay attention to how much mana one has left since this Noble Phantasm will suck it up in the blink of an eye.
The mana consumption with its True Name released is especially enormous.
(Replenishing his mana with the electricity stored by Galvanism while fighting is his primary combat style as an Archer.)

# Character

## Pronouns

First person pronoun: watashi
Second person pronoun: kimi/kisama/Mister 〇〇/Miss 〇〇
Third person pronoun: kare/kanojo/Mister 〇〇/Miss 〇〇

## Personality

A person who has great confidence in himself​, with intelligence to match it.
While it might seem like he's always boasting, in truth, 「If it's the real me then I can do it」, he won't say things he has no such confidence in.
His speech and conduct is exaggerated as if he were always on stage.
It is rare for him to strip off the mask (persona) of a genius.
Thinking about it, there is nobody other than the King of Inventors, Edison, who can make him get serious. However, he'll never admit that. When facing a Heroic Spirit that possesses genuine intellect, it's highly likely that he will take off his hat to that someone in his mind, but on the surface, he won't show any change.

## Attitude Towards Master

His attitude towards the Master, in one word, is haughty. A genius-like haughtiness. Basically, he won't listen to a word you say.
People who wield techniques exceeding human intellect - poets and artists, scientists - are 「main targets of observation」, military men and the like are 「main targets of experiment」 and with a 「fumu」, he will commence his observation of them. In things concerning the Master, he holds no interest.
However, the moment he discovers something irregular about the Master, like possessing 「poison resistance」, it seems like he'll make them a main target of observation and experiment.

His wish for the Holy Grail is the 「completion of the Nikola Tesla World System」.
A world where the alternating current comes and goes in space itself.
He's convinced that in the event that it is completed, mankind's civilization will develop by leaps and bounds.

## Dialogue Examples

「I am Nikola Tesla. A genius.」

「Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Let me show you a part of my genius here.」

「What is God? That's right, it's lightning. That's what people believed since antiquity, and indeed, even without mentioning the names of Zeus and Sakra devanam Indra, it is certainly God. Observe. This radiance that I lead to the world, is great energy itself.」

「Come! I will show it to you!」

「―――The Legend of Mankind・Advent of Thunder and Lightning!」

## Comment from the Illustrator

It's been a while since the last time I had to work on an old man so I did my best. Since it's a genius scientist, I tried giving a macho build. I'm wasn't wrong. With each evolution, the additional parts keep increasing in number so how will his final form look like? Until that day comes, I'm looking forward to the coil rotating. (Namaniku ATK (Nitroplus))
