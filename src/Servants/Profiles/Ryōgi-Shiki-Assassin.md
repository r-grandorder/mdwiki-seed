## Class Skills

**Presence Concealment: [C]**

Cuts off presence as a Servant. Suitable for covert actions.


**Independent Action: [A]**

The skill to act independently for a while without mana supply from the Master.
A style of Independent Action that makes you think if she’ll somehow manage even if Master’s not here.
However, no matter if it’s enough or not, I’ll disappear if it gets lonely so a Master is necessary, Mikiya-kun!

## Personal Skills

**Mystic Eyes of Death Perception: [A]**

Something of the highest grade even among supernatural powers, called Mystic Eyes.
An unusual power among unusual powers, a rarity among rarities. The primary factor of death of “living” things, regardless of inorganic or organic, can be read and visualized as a phenomenon that can be interfered with. The world seen from the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception is a scenery of termination filled with “lines of death”, and it’s difficult to face daily life with a proper mental structure with this.
Shiki usually comes to an understanding with this bizarre view by shifting her focus and overlooking everything.


**Eye of the Mind (Fake): [A]**

Tolerance to compensation due to visual interference.
Also called a sixth sense, or foreboding, it’s prediction of danger by means of natural talent.


**Yin-Yang Fish: [B]**

The helix of the Yin-Yang.
Letting live means killing, granting means harming.
Benefit and loss are two sides of the same coin. Just like the relationship between men and women.
…… Residual Pain. This Shiki supplies her NP by losing HP.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Yuishiki · Chokushi no Magan - Vijñaptimātratā · Mystic Eyes of Death Perception
- Rank: EX
- Type: Anti-Unit
- Range: 1
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person

Yuishiki · Chokushi no Magan.
By opening the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception to the maximum, the target’s “lines of death” are severed.
You may have millions of life-span, recovery power that resurrects from a suspended state, or a stock of hundreds of lives, but since “the concept of death in the individual” is laid bare, a fatal wound is inflicted while ignoring their immortality.


There are lives that have it difficult to die, not lives that can escape from death.
——— In the end, it’s common to all things.

# Character

## Pronouns

First person pronoun: オレ (ore) / in limited conditions 私 (watashi)
Second person pronoun: おまえ / 〇〇 (without honorifics)
Third person pronoun: あいつ (aitsu) / あの男 (ano otoko) / あの女 (ano onna)

## Personality

A cold and exclusive personality at first glance.
Although she uses a masculine tone and conducts herself as a man, she’s unavoidably feminine at the core so it’s wrong to say she’s a 『beauty in male clothing』.
She acts like an outlaw, but she gets lonely easily and has the temperament of an older sister by nature, so she takes care of those she’s fond of.
As for why she uses a masculine tone, or why she’s harsh with those with dual personality, please refer to 「the novel: Kara no Kyōkai」.

## Attitude Towards Master

Although she expresses her despise to being called when there’s an irregular trouble with a 「What’s with that, how troublesome」, you only live once so she approaches the protagonist with a feeling of lending them her power as long as they don’t do something unpleasant as a person or so.
「Meeting by chance, they also call it?」

## Dialogue Examples

「Servant Assassin, I’m Ryōgi Shiki. …… Is that fine as a greeting? What a weird rule, geez…… The circumstances are different, but I’ll go wild when I see it fit」

「A Holy Grail that grants wishes? The hell’s that, there’s a limit to fakes. Sales aren’t allowed in this house」

「Pin-pon-pan. A notice to all the curious ones. The next level is open, so regarding Master, please go ahead and challenge the next mission all together」

「A new request has come. Too many events happen in this mansion!」

「Death Perception ——— Death doesn’t stand in my way」

## Character in FGO

A girl encountered in the irregular Singularity, Boundary Formula.
Dressing with a blend of Japanese and Western outfits, a tone like that of a man, and the power not to doubt in her actions.
Any of those would ordinarily be regarded as conspicuous rarities.
Because of her idiosyncrasy of seeing death, she’s encountered several strange incidents, and cut them down.
She’s completely unaware of it, but she herself has become one of the urban legends that wanders late at night.


She’s unexceptionally one of the humans that were “burned out” by the King of Magecraft’s Incineration of Human Order, but she’s actually sleeping now, and the dream she’s watching has appeared as a Servant.
If she were to awake from her dream, she’d be burned out just like the other people, but as long as she’s dreaming, she’ll confront the King of Magecraft’s plan inside a 「disconnected time axis」 as a member of Chaldea.
Shiki herself doesn’t care about disappearing if she awoke from her dream, but it seems she can’t tolerate that the people around her would disappear.

## Related Characters

**Jekyll**

Very interesting as a senpai with two personalities. Jekyll’s lack of hope of getting ahead is irritating her…… That’s how it looks like, but it seems she’s comforting him.


**Mephisto**

Although noisy, you can’t disregard him for speaking funny.
「But isn’t using scissors as a weapon hard? A policy? I see…… Then it can’t be helped…… Standing out as a character is important for murderers……」


**King of the Cavern**

She won’t say where they match, but they’re Servants of the same type.
「That romantic power isn’t half-bad. That aside, how about you speak in a way that’s easier to understand?」

## Comment from the Illustrator

It’s a variously strange design now that I look at it again, but I’ve already come to a clean decision with those signs. I wanted the standing picture to be the strongest silhouette, so I went with the concept of remaking the cover image of Kodansha’s paperback edition. (Takeuchi Takashi)
