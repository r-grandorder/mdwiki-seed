## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [D]**

Invalidates single action magic use. Magic Resistance of the same degree of an amulet that wards off magical energy.

**Independent Action: [B]**

The ability to act independently for a period even if magic energy supply from the Master is severed.

At B rank, even if he loses his Master he is able to stay materialized for a period of 2 days.

## Personal Skills

**Mind’s Eye (True): [B]**

Insight cultivated by training and discipline.

A “combat logic” that calmly grasps of the enemy’s strength as well as his own situation during predicament and deduces the available means of survival on that situation. As long as there is even a 1% chance of comeback, it draws in the chance to put said strategy into motion.

**Clairvoyance: [C]**

The sharpness of eyesight. Improves both static visual acuity and kinetic vision.

Displays efficacy on apprehending distant target. On a higher rank, even x-ray vision and future sight becomes possible, but rank C does not reach such a level.

**Magic: [C-]**

The acquisition of orthodox magic. The category of its strong point is unknown.[1]

[1] Add on info from Emiya ingame profile:

**Magic: C (conditionally A+)**

A magic that reproduces tools by his image for but several minutes.

The pair of swords that Archer favored, Kanshou and Bakuya, was something created by means of projection magic as well.

Its rank rapidly increases only when the projection subject is categorized as “sword”.

Through the special trait of “able to prepare counterfeits many times over”, Emiya momentarily increases the power of the projected Noble Phantasm by making them detonates.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Unlimited Blade Works - Infinite Swords Creation

- Rank: E~A++
- Type: ???
- Range: ???
- Maximum target: ???

Unlimited Blade Works.

It is not an arsenal, but instead a special type of magic known as reality marble.

Reality marble is something that, for a certain period of time, overwrite reality with the user’s own mental world.

In Emiya’s case, all the weapons that he had seen in life are then and there immediately reproduced and accumulated. However, their ranks are decreased by one.

It is possible to reproduce defensive armament; however, it requires magical energy two to three times the amount needed for normal projection.

The pair of swords that Archer favored, “Kanshou and Bakuya”, was something created by means of projection magic as well

There are others as well, such as the shooting type mystic sword, the “Fake Spiral Sword (Caladbolg II)” and the tracking type mystic sword, the “Hound of the Red Plains (Hrunting)”.

Perhaps during his life it was common for him to have his arms customized; the projected Noble Phantasms appears to have been arranged in order to make them easier to use as well.

## Pronouns

- First pronoun: watashi/ore (conditionally)
- Second pronoun: omae/kisama/** (no honorifics)
- Third pronoun: yatsu/yatsura/** (no honorifics)

## Personality

Sarcastic and pessimistic. A realist that performs his job dispassionately.

However, he is not a workaholic, and there is a side of him that while showing hypocritical courtesy also cares and worries about others.

It appears that the nihilistic jest that he speaks of during critical moments are done while reading the place and situation.

That being said, due to being fundamentally a cool-headed professional, he gives off an image not unlike a law enforcer agent that puts aside his personal feeling during the job.

His ever austere expression is probably caused due to such an impairment.

He approves of logical tactics and justice in general, but his origin is the ideal of “wanting to save everyone”.

On top of his position as a “guardian”, who bears the role of steering away the ruin that is the annihilation of mankind, he had had enough of having to see mankind’s ugliness through endlessly murder.


However, while he may speak of regret of becoming a “guardian”, the choices that he makes are always a fight for the sake of protecting others, and he is firm in confronting the danger towards the world and prioritizing his duty as a “guardian” as he throws away his own motive and interest.

He had been established as a knight of the bow, but originally he was a magus.

His standard weapon being a bow appears to not due to his own strength as a Heroic Spirit amounting to that much, but as a result of his combat style eventually settling down with sniping from afar.

As a magus, he utilizes the projection magic--------a magic that reproduces tools by his image for but several minutes; a faker who imitates countless of famed and mystical swords.

## Attitude Towards Master

As a Servant, he makes it his principle to properly attend to his Master, dispassionately performing his job no matter what sorts of person the Master is.

He has no wish to entrust upon the Holy Grail, for he is different from the other Heroic Spirit, in that he died and became a Heroic Spirit by fulfilling his wish.

That being said, it is not as if he is completely without desire; when he was summoned to the Fifth Holy Grail War in the city of Fuyuki, he had been asked of what he wish for, and he replied in a joking manner with “eternal world peace”.

An expert of domestic chores; should he be summoned by a magus with low ability in daily life, it would not be an unusual situation for him to completely manage all matters in regards to daily chores, albeit with complaints.

He has one other wish that makes him respond to the Holy Grail War summoning, but that is a story for another time.


## Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Archer; here in response to your summon.

So you are my employer this time? Ah, just the name is enough. We’d eventually be able to find out about each other’s personality whether or not we want to.”

“I’d prefer to avoid pointless battles. The basis would be it being a waste of time, of magical energy, and above all, a disappointment from the incompetence on my Master’s part.”

“See, this is how it ends! From the beginning, you don’t know how to save others, you don’t have anyone to save! Know that this embodiment of unsightly justice is the very ruin of what you once were!”

“No matter what sort of predicament it is, there is always a way to survive it. The likes of despair are nothing but thoughtless words of those who just wants to comfort themselves. ”

## Historical Character and Figure

Due to his source being different from the other Heroic Spirit, one cannot say that he is a Heroic Spirit in the traditional sense.

If pressed to say, then his source would be the works of “Fate/stay night”.

He is an existence known as “guardians”, a defense apparatus brought about by mankind’s unconsciousness for the continuation of their existence.

In short, he is someone chosen by the the unconsciousness of the nameless mass, their faceless representative.

“Should an evil that accelerates the downfall of humanity appears, then the very elements that had allowed said evil to come to be shall all be eliminated.” Guardians materialize and perform their job with that as their objective.


They, who thwart the unseen danger of humanity’s downfall, may very well be the repairman of the era or such.[1]

The moment this deterrent cease to work, the downfall shall advance in haste and it would be honored as the “end” where mankind would sooner or later go beyond recovery.

As for why this magus ended up becoming a part of the guardians. The details are told pieces by pieces in the works of “Fate” series, but the whole story has yet to come to light.

[1] Pretty much word for word from Extra mats.

## Character in FGO

He made an appearance in Fuyuki City, which he had a deep connection with, which was the stage for the prologue “Ablazed Contaminated City Fuyuki”, while also act in a manner of protecting Artoria Pendragon (Alter) whom he is deeply tied with.

In his interlude story, as “a veteran who had walked through numerous Holy Grail Wars” he gives a lecture to the protagonist and Mashu in regards to the structure of Heroic Spirit and Holy Grail War, appearing as someone who is fond of teaching and caring for others.

## Depiction in past works

Although the Emiya that appears in “Fate/stay night” and Emiya who appears in “Fate/EXTRA” are very much the same person, the foundation of their setting is different. It was quite a complicated relation.

For the history in “Fate/stay night” and “Fate/EXTRA” had already diverged starting from the year of 1970.

## Related Characters

**All characters that appears in “Fate/stay night”**

An undesirable but inseparable relationship, especially with Cu Chulainn, whom he ends fighting against no matter where.

**Ishtar**

“Had she finally lost it…!?”

**Sengo Muramasa**

“.........Mmph. Not bad……...”

## Comment from the Illustrator

In the planning of his saint graph ascension evolution design, the first and the second was, well, I’d manage it one way or the other, but the third stage was pretty hard. The last form a character grows into is, to give it to you straight, something I’d like to land right in the center of what makes said character a character.

For Emiya, as expected I’d want to give his last ascension his usual red appearance, so either way I settled with the troublesome plan of “original design renewal” as the concept. (Takeuchi Takashi)
