## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [C]**

Negates spells with a chant of two verses or less.

Cannot defend against something more complex, like high magecraft or ritual curses.

**Independent Action: [A+]**

The ability to sustain herself for a while even if the mana supply from the Master is severed.

For the sake of her mission, she can fight alone.

**Mad Enhancement: [EX]**

Ranks up all parameters but deprives her of most of her sanity.

It’s unknown if this property was carried over from her original Berserker Saint Graph or if it was kept as a unique trait of the Heroic Spirit Nightingale.

She speaks slightly more tenderly than when she was a Berserker, but her basic conversation style hasn’t changed all that much.

## Personal Skills

**Assault Medicine: [C+]**

It's not a gun.

It is medicine.

The gun-like syringe owned by Archer Nightingale injects a variety of ampoules containing drugs with different effects by shooting them like a long-range weapon. It fires at 20 shots per second.

With a direct hit, the nursing/treatment subject will be healed in a matter of seconds.

With a direct hit, the sterilization/disinfection subject will be eradicated.

It’s a constantly active Noble Phantasm, but it’s displayed as a Skill in-game.

**Nurse of Steel (Christmas): [A+]**

An altered version of the Nurse of Steel Skill she has as a Berserker.

The Bell the Angel Rings in the Holy Night: EX

Archer Nightingale shows very little interest in the actual event of Christmas, but her modus operandi is deeply connected to the Holy Night.

Her scarlet costume and the golden bell fastened to her traveling bag are proof of that.

Still, she herself has no clue where those came from, she just was like that before she noticed.


## Noble Phantasm(s)

Nightingale’s spirit and will to get rid of all inadmissible pathogens and cure all the sick and wounded in need of treatment, abstracted as a sniper Noble Phantasm.

We assume it takes a form similar to a gun due to the influence of her military experience.

# Character

## Pronouns

First-person pronoun: Watashi

Second-person pronoun: Anata/Name-san/Mister Name/Miss Name

Third-person pronoun: Kare/Kanojo/Name-san/Mister Name/Miss Name

## Personality

The Angel of Crimea, who takes duty and devotion as her creed.

A conviction of steel. One who saves people. The Little War Office.

Her character is almost the same when she’s a Berserker, but...

Wonky logic and treatment regardless of consent.

That part is still is the exact same as the regular Nightingale. However...

Upon closer inspection, her words are slightly more graceful than usual.

While not frequently, you may even see her talking like a dreamer.

Archer Nightingale has her mentality mixed with the mentality of the younger Nightingale, the one from before she experienced nursing and medical care firsthand. For that reason, she's minutely more inclined to use phrasings and expressions that evidence her wealthy background.

## Attitude Towards Master

She wishes all the candy in the world would turn into medicine (like sweet cold remedies).

Also that Christmas should be changed into a holiday that celebrates the healing of wounds and ailments.

But she would never a cast a wish upon the Holy Grail for it.

Archer Nightingale wants to do it herself.

If you ask her “Isn’t it supposed to be ‘I wish all medicine in the world would turn to candy’?”, her answer would be “What’s the point? Of turning medicine? Into candy?”.

She’s not any willing to back down about this particular detail.

“Candy turning into medicine is a thing that dreams are made of. But medicine must remain as medicine”.

## Dialogue Examples

"Nice to meet you. How do you do? Any issues with your health?"

"No, I am not an angel. Please refrain from repeating the same misinformation."

"Excuse me, it's time for your treatment."

"Never forget to wash your hands and rinse your mouth. Are we understood?"

"Disinfection, sterilization, pasteurization!"

## Character 

Almost the same as Nightingale(Berserker).

She carries a large firearm that looks like a rifle but also like an umbrella, and her class was changed to Archer.

Judging by the key red tone in her outfit, she’s a Santa Servant, apparently…(?)

♢

The reason for this Saint Graph alteration was Nursery Rhyme's meddling.

After a series of incidents, Archer Nightingale accepted the child she once was and will then do her job as a new Santa Servant.

More specifically...

All while praying in the Holy Night, she will...

Fight to improve nursing and hygiene, and defeat all illnesses.

It's the same as always...?

That may be right, but it also may not be.

## Related Characters

**All Servants**

Nightingale perceives all Servants as "soldiers".

They get injured often.

In other words, they are nursing patients.

**Enemies**

Whoever attacks her is an enemy soldier, but they are also lives to be saved.

She must first incapacitate them or else she won't be able to treat them or nurse them.

**Caligula/Phantom/Gilles (Caster)/Salome/Salieri/Mori Nagayoshi/Baobhan Sith**

The mentally ill are nursing patients too.

**Monte Cristo**

He'll need some nursing in the special ward.

Ah, he's escaping again! Mister!

Hold it right there. Mister!

**Ashiya Douman**

Stop.

It seems you need nursing in the special ward.

Hurry!

## Comment from the Illustrator

When I received the commission for Nightingale (Santa), I was requested to make multiple versions. This Mary Poppins-style Santa was chosen among 3 drafts. I talked to them about wanting to draw the other forms, and as result, I got to draw the nurse version from the candidates in the Final Ascension. (Takahashi Keitarou)
