## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [A]**

He possesses Saber-level Magic Resistance, but it does not apply against sacraments of the Church.

## Personal Skills

**Revelation: [A]**

A skill equivalent to Instinct. Whereas Instinct is a ‘sixth sense’ for combat, Revelation applies to all matters related to the attainment of a goal; the choosing of the best path during a journey, for example. However, as these choices are not based on anything concrete (that he is aware of) he cannot explain them to others very well.

**True Name Discernment: [B]**

By being summoned as a Ruler, all Servants that he meets directly will have their true names and parameters automatically revealed. However, a LCK check is necessary against Servants with concealment abilities.

**Divine Judgment: [C]**

The authority exclusive to Rulers to exercise Command Spells against other Servants.

**Charisma: [C-]**

The inborn talent to command a military force. Although he cannot govern a nation, he can form powerful bonds with comrades with whom he share the same aims, and they are willing to lay their lives down for them. Due to this skill, he is also able to have his comrades believe in the contents of his Revelations.

**Baptismal Rite: [B+]**

Magecraft formulated in the style of the Church that is tremendously effective against spiritual bodies. Combined with his two Noble Phantasms, he can sublimate even Servants.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Dual Arms, Zero Point Convergence — Twin Arms, Big Crunch

- Rank: A+
- Type: Anti-Army
- Range: 1-200
- Maximum Targets: 500 persons

Connecting both arms to a leyline, he adds excessive amounts of magical energy into the Magic Circuits in both arms until they go out of control. An annihilation Noble Phantasm that produces artificial dark matter drawing in everything in its surrounding.

As it requires such massive amounts of energy, it normally cannot be used as a Noble Phantasm. To fully power this Noble Phantasm, he must somehow secure a path of energy provision separate from the Master.

# Right Arm, Predation of Wickedness — Right Hand, Evil Eater

# Left Arm, Foundation of Heaven’s Blessings — Left Hand, Xanadu Matrix

- Rank: D
- Type: Anti-Unit
- Range: 1
- Maximum Targets: 1

His own two hands that had become Noble Phantasms. By these two hands, he had caused miracles to occur again and again, bringing hope to those faithfuls who walked a path of hardships. Able to connect to any magecraft foundation, they form a ‘skeleton key’ allowing him to wield any form of magecraft.

At the same time, his right and left arms can exercise abilities similar to the Mind’s Eye (True) and Mind’s Eye (False) skills respectively, and strengthen his Baptismal Rites.

## Personality

An amiable and mild young man, although he is philosophical to a peculiar degree and his actions can appear strangely caculating. Rather than building tough walls, he is the type to maintain his relations with others on a knife’s edge, keeping them neither friend nor foe. If anyone could draw close to him, it would be one who would accept his beliefs and wield its power.

## Attitude Towards Master

He maintains a very modest relationship with his Master. As long as they do not accept his desires for the Holy Grail, the Master remains a target for purging no matter how friendly their relationship becomes. But if – only if – his Master assented to his views, and Amakusa Shirou himself recognized his Master as worthy of entrusting with his dream, then would he gladly offer his own life.

## Historical Character and Figure

Amakusa Shirou Tokisada is the young man who served as the leader of Edo era’s greatest uprising, the Shimabara Rebellion. At the time, the Shimabara’s peasants had been suffering from heavy taxation levied by Shimahara’s daimyo, the clan of Matsukura. THe merciless land tax collection had been more than twice the crop yield, caused by sloppy land survey.

Not only that, other taxes such as the poll tax was implemented by the daimyo to squeeze out even more tax from the peasants, and finally, they revolted--------opening the curtain for the greatest insurrection in the Edo period that aimed to eradicate the Bakumatsu, the Shimabara Rebellion.

During the rebellion, there existed a certain spiritual leader.

For the persecuted Christians, he was the child of miracle.

He was likened to a holy man; walking above the sea, healing wounds, able to control birds.[1]

Deeds no men are capable of doing, miracles that only a saint allowed to perform.

His name was Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.

It was unknown how much command this young man had during the rebellion.

However, one way or another it was beyond doubt that his position had been in the summit, or infinitely close to it.

…..I heard the voice of heaven, he had uttered.

In which case, the blessed young man had believed. Explaining it would have been too difficult, yet there had been no need for it.

Those who revere him as their leader would abide by those words and fight.

--Maybe he had been too greedy. Or perhaps everything had gone too smoothly.

Or perhaps it was due to his words of “If I alone am killed, then perhaps this rebellion would end peacefully” being denied, and everything was pushed to the idea that the Edo shogunate must be opposed.

The Shimahara Rebellion then led towards the only tragic way it could; it was reported that the the massacre includes the besieged 37000 member of the rebellion (there are various theories.)

Amakusa Shirou Tokisada was then decapitated.

…..The wish of the Amakusa Shirou Tokisada as a Servant is the salvation of mankind.

It had nothing to do with good or evil; each and every mankind is a target of salvation.

For that, he would bear even the long time of 60 years.

With the Human Order Incineration currently imminent, as of now he kept that wish of his to himself, and yet---------------

**Jeanne d’Arc**

The holy maiden with whose fate his own was entangled during a certain Holy Grail War, and he speaks as though he still remembers the event. At any rate, as they are not ideologically opposed, there are no ill feelings between them.

**Edmond Dantes**

The Avenger whom he learned of and fought against during a certain ordeal. He is unsure whether it is admiration or pity he holds for the man who cast away his own self to carry on the spirit of vengeance.

**Semiramis**

An empress of the Middle East who…? Fufufu, how can it be that such a fraud of a hero finds himself connected to such a figure? Impossible, surely… and yet it is a curious thing that we call fate.

## Comment from the Illustrator

There’s this matter where he happens to accidentally resembles someone. Maybe I should call it the Shirou Series. I took quite an effort on getting that balance right. His charm point is how his last ascension’s ponytail splits into two. For those who’s like, eh, who is that, is that last ascension a sailor uniform or a miko uniform? Please come to the student counseling room afterwards. Once you be a good boy and read the published works, sensei will give you some candy. (Konoe Ototsugu)
