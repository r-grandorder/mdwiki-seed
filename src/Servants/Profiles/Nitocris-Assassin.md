## Class Skills



**Presence Concealment: [A]**

She’s there but can’t be found anywhere.

Nitocris, who took the appearance of Medjed, is endowed with a high rank of the Presence Concealment skill.





**Divinity: [B+]**

Measures divine attitude.

Perhaps the rank has increased because she’s taking the appearance of Medjed, she can’t tell the truth with certainty.



## Personal Skills



**White Imperial Garments: [A]**

The white imperial garments (for some reason, read as mizo instead of gyoi) Nitocris wears.

It is said that these garments are proof of Medjed’s protection and affection.

Since it’s a personal statement, it’s unknown if it’s true.





**Beach Panic: [EX]**

What’s that……?

What the……?

Whether it’s by the protection of Medjed or by whatever, Nitocris, who is wearing the white imperial garments, gathers strange looks from the public.





**Royal Road of Hot Sands: [A]**

A skill derived from Imperial Privilege.

With this skill, Nitocris has obtained close combat skills she shouldn’t have any future at.

It’s possible that she came up with something after seeing Cleopatra’s Pharaoh Martial Arts.



## Noble Phantasm(s)



# Sneferu Iteru Nile: Wash out the impurities, blue and beautiful Nile



* Rank: B
* Type: Anti- Noble Phantasm
* Range: 1~30
* Maximum number of targets: 100 people





Sneferu Iteru Nile.

To the disrespectful who toy with the throne of the Pharaoh who is a god, a punishment.

To the treacherous who killed the loved siblings, death.

The Pharaoh that was appointed as their puppet, Nitocris, could never forgive the influential figures that looked down on the gods.

She gathered them and opened a banquet at a secretly built subterranean chamber, and she drowned every single of them when a great amount of water from the Nile entered the chamber and filled it ――― that’s how it’s said that Nitocris accomplished her revenge.





This vengeance that was written in the work 『The Histories』of the Greek Herodotus, became the Noble Phantasm of Nitocris in the Assassin class.

That is, a revenge that leads to death by enclosing the enemy’s surroundings with stone walls and pouring the water of the Nile. High-Thaumaturgy falsely resembling a Reality Marble.



# Character



## Pronouns



* First person pronoun: 私 (watashi)
* Second person pronoun: 貴方 (anata) / あなた (anata)
* Third person pronoun: 彼 (kare) / 彼女 (kanojo) / 〇〇 (sometimes she uses the full name) / 〇〇殿 (name + dono)



## Personality



Nitocris was ashamed of herself.

Deeply embarrassed for having served rudely to the Pharaoh Ozymandias, she covered herself with a gown with an『I can’t face him anymore!』. (Saint Graph First Stage)



However, she hides pride as a Pharaoh in her chest.

In the end, she’s just ashamed of facing other Pharaoh figures.





With her clothing change, her Saint Graph changed too, and even her Noble Phantasm has changed by entering the Assassin class…… But inside she’s the same Nitocris as usual.

As usual, she is quick to jump into the wrong conclusion, careless and of quick temper.



## Attitude Towards Master



The attitude towards the Master doesn’t change.

In the end, a Master is an 『ally hand』 for her.

『That’s fine, but I’ve recently been feeling I’ve been treated like a pile of junk although Pharaohs are great』





## Dialogue Examples



『DISRESPECTFUL, DISRESPECTFUL, THAT’S DISRESPECTFUL……』



『DIVINE PUNISHMENT IS CERTAIN』



『Although I change my appearance, I’m me. I’m your ally.』



『As a matter of fact, I don’t hate swimming at the waterside. Yes, by the side of the Nile with my brothers, I often……』



『Eh? Pool? What are you talking about? When did I say I want to go to the pool?』



## Character in FGO



Nitocris in a state in which her Saint Graph changed after wearing imperial garments.

The same person as the Caster Nitocris.





♢





This summer, Nitocris, who heard the opening of the event thought 『It’s the perfect chance to show the Pharaoh’s majesty!』.

However, if you read carefully the participation conditions, a support role is needed. That’s a problem.

It may be irreverent, but by telling them the circumstances, she’d let the other Pharaohs be the drivers, and she’d just act as a support.

With that said, she searched about for the Pharaohs, but ―――

After being flatly rejected by the Pharaoh Ozymandias with an 『I’m not interested. Get lost』, Nitocris felt deeply ashamed.





With that, she couldn’t meet his face.

She was so embarrassed, she covered herself with a gown and hid her face.

That form is completely like Medjed’s……





Then, something happened.

Perhaps because she resembles Medjed, or perhaps for other causes, Nitocris’ Saint Graph changed temporarily. Her class also changed to Assassin. (Saint Graph First Stage)





Furthermore, she’s wearing a swimsuit under the gown. (Saint Graph Third Stage)





If she finishes the Ishtar Cup safely, she vaguely thought that she could make use of these mystic imperial garments to manufacture summer dresses or something like that. (Saint Graph Third Stage)

Thinking about it, she took the shape she thought of. This bizarre phenomenon would be handed down among the Chaldea staff as 『Medjed-sama’s Blessings』, or not……

I, I-I-I, I apologize I apologize I apologize I apologize I apologize I apologize……





**Scheherazade**

Pressed to participate in the Ishtar Cup by promising to give her an immortality amulet (in short, it could be thought of as a deluxe edition of a Guts Mystic Code).

Even after the Cup has ended, a friendly relationship continues appearing.





**Cleopatra**

Unintentionally, I imitated her battle style.

I’ll have to explain it someday……





**Iskandar**

Taking off the imperial garments is no good! (Saint Graph First Stage)

Eh, B-Bastet-sama?! Ah, I was wrong……



## Comment from the Illustrator



Since I started with the design of the first Ascension, I thought that the first impact would be important. But there’s too much impact in the first Ascension, so the second and third ones won’t be seen so much… I had that sense of uneasiness and was really nervous until she was implemented, but I felt so relieved to support so many people with the second and third ones. By the way, the first time I submitted the illustration for the final Ascension she wasn’t wearing it, so I was scolded by the president when they supervised it and made her wear it. (Shimaudon) (Shimaudon, you madman)
