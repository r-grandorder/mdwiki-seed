## Personal Skills

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Smile of the Stheno - Smile of the Goddess

- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~20
- Maximum target: 1 person

Smile of the Stheno.

The charm of the goddess, capable of turning heroes into captives by a single blow, taking form as a Noble Phantasm.

Be it a powerful war veteran or a gentleman filled with integrity, as long as he is a male he will immediately die (fall). The strongest of whispers, filled with words of love.

The languorous gaze is her blade, the alluring whispers her poison.

And after that is the killing blow-----a bewitching adorable pose that drops all pretenses. And the perfect finisher, a heart shape with her finger!

Most men would fall over it, yet when one manages to endure it, she would get quite vexed. (Just vexed. That's it.)

# Character

## Pronouns

- First pronoun: watashi
- Second pronoun: anata
- Third pronoun: kare/kanojo

* She calls Euryale "watashi (Euryale)" for both second and third pronoun

## Personality

A beautiful maiden, elegance and grace themselves given form.

Her action is elegant, her grace overflowing, and her words and deeds prudent.

The perfect goddess, the ideal woman.

Any men would extol her and praise her above. Beautiful and adorable things, she freely and unconditionally loves; while ugly things, she unconditionally hates.

At least, that's how she pretends to be-----

The truth is, although she is endowed with elegance and grace, at her core one can say that she has quite a lazy disposition. She is quite cruel to those who is indifferent towards her. So much that even the watchdog of the underworld (Tartarus) would tremble.

In regards to her younger sister (Medusa), even though she bullies her together with Euryale whenever and wherever possible. In truth, she loves her.

--She truly loves her. From the bottom of her heart, even beyond death.

## Attitude Towards Master

She has no wish towards the Holy Grail.

If she is compelled to think of one, it would be to "return to the place where the three sisters once were", but she already knows. That it is nothing but a wish that would never come true.

## Dialogue Examples

"Medusa's the type that would immediately burst to tears when she ended up alone, no? Being her relatives, we shan't allow such disgrace to be."

"Really, such a foolish sister-----"

"I am a goddess. A phenomenon born and desired to turn one captives, no matter how much of a brave hero he is. A slight amount is fine, but do take care to avoid being completely addicted to me."

"I shall teach you. Yes, mm, I shall teach you [I]exceptionally. Of what kind of thing my "divine core" is-----"

## Historical Character and Figure

She blooms gloriously and beautifully. Until such times when she would be plucked off and broken.*

The eternal maiden, born for the sake of being loved by somebody------

The eldest daughter of the three Gorgon sisters from the Greek mythology.

The embodiment of men's yearning, she is a goddess born as the perfect idol.

The same with the second daughter Stheno, she was once one of the gods of ancient Greek. Normally there is no way for her to be summoned as a Servant, but for some reason she manifested anyway. She is truly weak, possessing practically no combat prowess, but her Noble phantasm is exceedingly powerful in a certain sense.

Helplessly weak in exchange for eternal beauty...such is a goddess she should have been, but due to becoming a Servant she becomes somewhat stronger.

The Gorgon sisters were originally the same existence, so naturally Euryale and Stheno are eternally identical existences as well, connected together. Existing in a similar way with a certain kind of collective system that exceeds even a communion of minds, they call each other "me".

(The third daughter is an exception; she ended up growing and becoming different in height and build, her heart losing her connection with them.)

::: tip
* its a bit of an innuendo because it can also mean when a woman is like, "taken".

## Concept

An ancient idol.

She is a genuine idol, the embodiment of a whimsical and cruel goddess. A hero may have overthrown any sorts of monsters, yet he would be utterly incapable of overthrowing such a goddess.

## Related Characters

**Euryale**
Her other self.
She calls her as she calls herself, "me".

**Medusa**
Her beloved younger sister. She actually really loves her.
On the surface she calls her "mere slave" and "Meduseless", always bullying her. Her younger sister definitely fears her. And yet...
When Medusa was exiled to the Shapeless Isle by the twelve Olympians, she went together with her, as if it was only obvious that she would do so. She had continued to harbor no fear towards her sister, even as Medusa was gradually changing into a grotesque monster, and met her for the last time.

**Asterios**
The boy who lately Euryale takes to.
Just what is that thing, I wonder?

## Comment from the Illustrator

I had told myself that I'm fine, I have the previous design after all, but then later on it was such an immense pressure. The third stage's golden makes my heart all fluttering and scratching; no, to put it simply, I have shown the chink in my armor towards the goddess at the very end! Is what the result of the raging battle within my heart. (Again, be it due to the opening that I've shown or just naturally happens, I really think this goddess is beautiful.) THe shape of the base design's heel sandal really, really makes my heart throb, so I really didn't hesitate over it. (AKIRA)
