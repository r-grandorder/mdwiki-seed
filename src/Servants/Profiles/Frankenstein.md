## Class Skills

**Mad Enhancement: [D]**

Raises the Strength and Endurance parameters, but language ability becomes simple, and continuing complex thoughts becomes difficult.

## Personal Skills

**Lament of the Hollow Living: [D]**

A shrill shout that can’t be known when will end and that increases while on Mad Enhancement.

It deprives enemies and allies without distinction of their ability to think, and those without the capacity to resist will panic and become unable to breathe.

**Galvanism: [B]**

Free conversion, as well as accumulation, of electric current and mana from living organisms.

It invalidates attacks without substance like magical light, magical wind, or magical bullets, by instantly converting them into electricity and discharging it into the environment.

Also, the body is strengthened depending on the amount of stored electricity, and the repair of damage is done more quickly.

**Overload: [C]**

An intentional boost up while being aware of suffering damage.

In Frankenstein’s case, she converts the mana accumulated with Galvanism into more electricity than the maximum permissible level, and bounces the attack power of her Noble Phantasm up by outputting all of it.

Since her body can’t bear it, she suffers damage.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Bridal Chest - Maiden’s chastity

- Rank: C
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person


Bridal Chest.

A tree branch-shaped war hammer (mace) wrapped in discharged current.

The sphere at the tip is her heart itself, and she keeps it close to her even outside battle.

It works by making electric supply occur through the fin at the head of the original body and the fin at the rear part.

Since it efficiently collects and accumulates wasted mana from herself and the environment, in battle, where surplus of mana keeps occurring abundantly in the surroundings, it can combine with Galvanism to pseudo-act as the 『Type II Perpetual Engine』.

(The True Name release won’t happen in 『FateGO』)


# Blasted Tree - Lightning Tree of Crucifixion

- Rank: D~B
- Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum number of targets: 30 people


Blasted Tree.

A full-power discharge occurred by thrusting『Maiden’s chastity』 into the ground and removing all the limiters. It pours down with the silhouette of a towering big tree, a diffuse homing thunder.

If the enemy is standing alone and at a short range, it can be activated even without “Maiden’s chastity”. Although it’s controlled through limiters, its power when they’re canceled is overwhelming. But in that case, the user suspends their activity completely. That is, 『death』.

This thunder attack has a low chance of the possibility of giving birth to a second Frankenstein Monster.

Although, she who has died can’t see that result.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First person pronoun: わたし (watashi)
- Second person pronoun: None
- Third person pronoun: None

## Personality

If she was to be compared with something, it’d kind of be a large-breed dog that distrusts humans.

There’s wisdom, but since she’s a Berserker anyhow, she can’t convey her own feelings.

Since saying a single word isn’t an average difficulty, she seldom speaks.

Her hobby is saving electricity, so wasting it is forbidden.

Also, since her regulation of emotional control is not going well, there are times when she displays a ferocious personality.

## Attitude Towards Master

In order to become as human as possible, she draws near the Master and learns how to be human.

Although grumpy, she’s a good girl Servant that will respond to conversations properly if she sincerely gets along with you.

However, in order to transmit will through hand signals and gesticulations, the Master must improve their gesture skills.


## Dialogue Examples

『Naaaaaaaaaaoooooo!!』

『Uu…… Uuuuuuh!!』

『With me, together, come』

## Historical Character and Figure

Originally a character in Mary Shelley’s novel 『Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus』, a nameless monster.

A man-made life form produced by the doctor Victor Frankenstein by patching corpses, in addition to the power of thunderbolts.


In the novel, she’s a scientifically cast monster, but in this work Victor Frankenstein himself isn’t fictional, he exists in someone as a man who made an artificial human by fusing alchemy and science.


The purpose of creating an artificial human was to recreate the primeval human Adam. That is, 『she』 who is summoned as a Servant was cast as an Eve that would conceive Adam.

However, that ended in failure. Doctor Frankenstein made a failed work, a girl that displayed a tremendous ferocity and couldn’t control her emotions.


The problem was that the doctor himself thought she was a helpless monster no one could lay a hand on.

And, the doctor Frankenstein, by no means a fool who lacked emotions and could only display a ferocious personality, escaped without acknowledging her.


The reason of her existence, the purpose of Eve ――― that is, becoming the mother of Adam, was announced by the doctor. But in order to do that, a companion was needed above all, and the only one that could create that companion was the doctor Frankenstein alone.


An interminable chase drama.

She announces. That the doctor has the responsibility and the crime.

The responsibility of having created me, and the crime of having abandoned me ―――


Although the doctor refused by saying there was no way he could create two monsters in this world, the girl that he once established as a target, exerted her ferocity and persistently demanded.

She killed the doctor’s family, but even so the doctor, far from claiming revenge, ran and ran away.


Why don’t you hate me?

Why don’t you look at me?


Following the runaway doctor she went to the South Pole, in front of the doctor who chose death while fearing and rejecting, the girl finally despaired that she couldn’t be human.

That’s why, she entrusted the Holy Grail.

To bring a companion that would make her human.

Though ――― Some time is necessary for her to realize that, that itself, is her encounter with the Master.

## Related Characters

Friend? Grandpa? Big kettle? Mm, don’t know.

## Comment from the Illustrator

This Frankenstein is one from among the 3 patterns I proposed. At first, she didn’t have a neck, a design in which the head looked like it was hanging down because of the metal fixtures of the collar and ears. Notes about the difficult to see eyes being mismatched in color, and the heart being inside the mace, were included in the initial draft. Thank goodness you have a neck in the end, Fran-chan.
