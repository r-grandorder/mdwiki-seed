## Class Skills

**Territory Creation: [C+]**

As a Mage, one can create an advantageous position for themselves.

Although smaller in scale than a Workshop, Mephistopheles can create an extremely efficient “Laboratory”.

**Tool Creation: [B]**

One can create devices tinged with Magical Energy.

Because he served as an assistant to an alchemist for many years, it is feasible for Mephistopheles to create all sorts of magical devices.

## Personal Skills

**Curse Techniques: [A]**

Mephistopheles uses classical western Curse Techniques as his specialty. Its purpose covers many uses, like returning twofold to his opponent the wounds he himself has received from them, sowing discord in one’s personal relationships, giving nightmares by using incubi, and so forth. It is even difficult for the average Mage to resist it.

**Innocent Monster: [B]**

Contract Devil ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■. The name of a monster that had Mephistopheles’ past and the way he ought to be distorted according to the image born from his deeds while alive. His abilities and appearance have been completely transformed. In his case, there is nothing but merits, such as having his Curse Techniques strengthened, possessing Magecraft that reached the level of a Noble Phantasm, and so forth. A first-class devil.

**The Clown’s Laughter: [A+]**

A Skill derived from Innocent Monster. As a(n established) devil, Mephistopheles can put an intense heavy pressure on the entirety of mankind as a species. If there is a possibility of failure in any situation, it will fail without exception, one falling into a state like they had been abandoned by fortune.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Tick-Tock Bomb: Dozing Bomb

- Rank: A+
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum Number of Targets: 30 people

A kind of Curse Technique that intentionally lays bugs into one’s Magic Circuits and the Spiritual Bodies of Servants before making them explode by causing an impact on them. Specifically, they appear in some image that is like a combination of a pocket watch and a bomb. Mephistopheles installs these on the field so they would explode on contact————or rather, that is how he pretends to use them in such a method.

But actually, on the occasion of having its “True Name” invoked, it results in a situation where the targets that are within a medium range will have bombs inserted inside their bodies. In this situation, a check based on one’s resistance to curses is carried out to prevent this. The maximum number of bombs per person is five, and in addition, including the ones installed on the field and the like, it is possible to install a total of thirty bombs. Of course, Mephistopheles can just finish his targets off right there and then if he detonates the bombs inserted inside their bodies, but he likes to take the opportunity to have the overall picture of the bombs being inside their bodies stand out to them on purpose, choosing a means of having them obey him as well by threatening them. It is possible to say that this unscrupulous Noble Phantasm is as if his trickiness and ruthlessness had combined together.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: watakushi
- Second Person Pronoun: anata-sama
- Third Person Pronouns: ano kata / kare / kanojo, etc.

## Personality

Mephistopheles acts as someone cheerful and easygoing, and because he takes up a jestful attitude at all times no matter the kind of occasion it is, one cannot feel a sense of seriousness from him. That is to say, he is more cruel than what anyone can imagine, and he is similarly cruel towards his Master too. He is really like “making fun” of the whole world, and if he is happy, it seems he is willing to kill Masters as well.

## Attitude Towards Master

At a first glance, Mephistopheles faithfully serves in a cheerful manner. However, regarding his Master, he basically does not think of them as anything but “a toy to entertain himself with” to a degree, and he will drive his Master into despair if given the chance. In the case where his Master has vigilantly restrained every way for him to act against them, even though unwillingly, Mephistopheles will accept the relationship between a master and a servant. He basically does not take up the “disobeying one’s commands” attitude. However, it is a different story of whether or not he properly understands and acts on the commands.

And from there progressing one step even further, where a situation has appeared in that his Master had deepened their bond with him while accepting all of those wickedness and immaturity of his, it seems Mephistopheles will fight while gambling his life for the sake of his Master, all with pleasure and while laughing.

## Dialogue Examples

“Greetings, greetings. Caster, I have come. Although it is regretful in that it appears your expectations have been infringed upon, for as you can see, I am not particularly the one you call a ‘devil’. Please kindly understand that these horns are decorations.”

“Oh? Master. You are also making an amusing face, no? What happened? Have you made up your mind on what you even want to do if it is for the sake of having your wish granted?
Peaceful, so peaceful like the life of a single child.”

“Oh dear! Master. You are a human being who cannot help being very careless! It is no wonder I have been summoned as you have only succeeded in doing reckless things!”

“Make the name of Mephistopheles my True Name! Let us drive a humorous despair into our enemies!”

## Historical Character and Figure

Georg Faust is the model for the protagonist in Goethe’s play, “Faust”. He is an astrologer and an alchemist, and the devil he contracted with is Mephistopheles.

Mephistopheles is the Devil of Temptation in “Faust”, and he played a bet with God on whether or not he was made to corrupt Dr. Faust.

In the end, Mephistopheles was defeated in this bet, and his wish to acquire Faust’s soul had not come true, but it is said that the real Faust, in the middle of his alchemy experiment, was killed in a bombing where his whole body violently exploded and broke apart into five pieces. It did not become clear whether this was Mephistopheles carrying out his contract, or if something separate was the main cause of Faust’s death.

… In this work, Mephistopheles is a kind of familiar cast by Dr. Faust; namely, a sort of homunculus. Dr. Faust, with his gifted engineering, had advanced homunculus technology several generations ahead of his time, but because of his strange sense of aesthetics, he chose to strengthen the homunculus’ self (ego). A homunculus that is exceedingly full of human traits————That is the key part of “Mephistopheles”; furthermore, by being clad in that legend, the Servant Caster – Mephistopheles, was born.

“I… was born to be a Servant.”

Pay special attention to Mephistopheles’ face that feigns ignorance. Indeed, it may not become known that although Mephistopheles was born to be a Servant, since there was no need for him to have a person who he could call ‘Master’————

Ok, Mephistopheles is just a little lonely.

## Comment from the Illustrator

I viewed Mephistopheles as and designed him in the image of an abnormal, visually-looking clown. In relation to his clothing, because the Director was worried about it, having said that “Shimokoshi-kun, they are not good clothes to wear when he is getting on a bicycle”, they had changed into snug clothing that is like a cycling jersey. I tried to make his overall design insect-like and with gaudy-ish hues; doing things like adding some tactile-like horns of a longhorn beetle, and so on.

Mephistopheles’ weapon. I thought it would be normal if it was a cane (stick), but it was going to be a pair of scissors by the time his character design came together, and they particularly have no significance. Say, it was nice for Mr. Koyasu to be given the assignment for his voice, given that I was drawing Mephistopheles’ pictures while imagining his voice, so when the cast was decided, I was happy. Just like Mephistopheles’ image! (Shimokoshi)
