## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [C+]**

Cancels spells with a chant below two verses. Can’t defend against large scale magecraft like High-Thaumaturgy or Greater Rituals.

Has a remarkable resistance against Japan-related sorcery.

## Personal Skills

**Exorcism of Grudging Spirits: [A]**

An incantation of resistance against evil curses by performing the kuji “Rin-pyō-tō-sha-kai-jin-retsu-zai-zen” (curiously, they wrote 臨 instead of 临 for the first syllable). If it succeeds, it’ll seal the opponent’s magecraft.


**Imposing Stance: [B]**

A reproduction skill of a famous episode that Benkei performed.

Of course, since he’s not Benkei himself, he doesn’t have the ability to sublimate it as a Noble Phantasm, it falls into a simple defense enhancement and acknowledgment as a target, a state of receiving concentrated attacks.


**Blank Subscription List: [-]**

A reproduction skill of a famous episode that Benkei performed.

It forcibly executes a Noble Phantasm sealing order, but since he isn’t Benkei to begin with, the chance of sealing is low.


**Attendant of Iron: [C]**

A reproduction skill of the episode of how Benkei was in the past. Increases the Master’s stamina.

(Not used in 『FateGO』).

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Gohyaku Rakan Fudaraku Tokai - Sea Passage to Potalaka of the Five Hundred Arhat

- Rank: EX
- Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum number of targets: 500 people

Gohyaku Rakan Fudaraku Tokai.

Calls a large procession of wandering saints. They are travelers that go to a sea passage to Potalaka (a drifting going to attain Buddhahood in life while confined in coffin-like boats with the Western Pure Land as a goal).

In the occasion that those in the spot fail a resistance check, they’re forcibly moved, finally taken to the Pure Land and enter Nirvana. Namu.

In other words, it’s a semi-forced instant death spell, but in the game it only has a chance of inflicting stun and curse.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First person pronoun: 拙者 (sessha) / 拙僧 (sessō)
- Second person pronoun: あなた (anata) / 〜殿など (〜-dono nado)
- Third person pronoun: 彼 (kare) / 彼女 (kanojo) / あやつ (ayatsu)

## Personality

Fundamentally, he acts as a boorish military man…… but, as a matter of fact, he’s quite a funny one, and happens to have a cowardice (or pacifism) that hates battle.

## Attitude Towards Master

He apparently has a feeling of guilt for not being Benkei to begin with, in some respects solemn. If he’s trusted, he’ll reveal his True Name on his own, and will fight as Hitachibō Kaison.

## Dialogue Examples

『Musashibō Benkei, I have manifested as a spearman. Nice to meet you.』

『What? To fight with Yoshitsune-dono? I don’t mind. Now, whether I have a chance of winning or not is a different issue.』

『…… I, I’m called Kaison. Benkei is here, but I want you to hold to this name.』

## Historical Character and Figure

The first subordinate of Minamoto no Yoshitsune (Ushiwakamaru), and the most famous warrior monk in Japanese history. Even in modern times, he’s loved in a wide range of stories like kabuki and jōruri. Many legends like Benkei’s imposing stance or Benkei’s crying spot are told nowadays.

Following Yoshitsune until the end, he finally arrived at his lurid last moments striking a daunting pose while receiving countless arrows without giving a single step backwards.

――― The summoned one isn’t Musashibō Benkei, but the fellow subordinate of Yoshitsune, Hitachibō Kaison.

Just before the battle in which Yoshitsune and Benkei met their bloody end, he ran away like a coward.

As an atonement, Kaison uses Benkei as his True Name. In order to make his name eternal, he seals the comicality of his future personality.

According to one theory, he’s said to have lived hundreds of years after becoming a hermit.

## Comment from the Illustrator

The character designer is that Terada Katsuya-daisensei. I carefully observed the design sketches in the pictures, but I was made realize again how astounding his drawing art is. I struggled not to make an unfavorable comparison as much as I could, but I only was overwhelmed by my lack of ability…… (Shinjirō)
