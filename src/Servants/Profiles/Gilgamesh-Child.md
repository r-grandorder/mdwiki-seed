## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [E]**

Nullifies low ranking Magecraft spells.

**Independent Action: [A]**

Gilgamesh possesses a high-ranked Independent Action Skill. But in the case of using a large amount of Magical Energy, backup from his Master becomes necessary.

**Divinity: [B] ([A+])**

Gilgamesh originally had his Divinity at his maximum rank of A+, but the rank has been lowered because said person does not have a favourable impression of the gods.

## Personal Skills

**Beautiful Rosy-Cheeked Boy: [C]**

One’s nature as a pretty boy that attracts people. It works as a magical charm effect towards people, regardless of their gender, but evasion is possible with the Magical Resistance Skill. Even if one does not have Magical Resistance, they can abate it to some extent so long as they maintain a will to resist.

**The Golden Rule: [A]**

Indicates the fortune of how much money flowed around oneself in their life.

Gilgamesh, who is considered to be someone who has infinite wealth in the Golden Capital, will never be troubled with money throughout his whole life and can live as an extremely rich person.

**Charisma: [A+]**

Gilgamesh, who is said to be the most outstanding King, possesses an extremely high charisma – as if it is even a charm or a curse – already since the time of his youth.

**Collector: [EX]**

The talent to obtain items of a superior quality.

It is the good luck to incessantly procure even rare items, but it must be remembered that it is a Skill Gilgamesh possesses, so there is no benefit for his Master.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Gate of Babylon: The Treasures of the King
- Rank: B+
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: –
- Maximum Number of Targets: –

A keyblade that is linked to the Golden Capital. It connects to the capital’s dimensional space, with which Gilgamesh will be freely able to take out the tools that are within his treasure house. It goes without saying that the more of the user’s treasures there are, the more powerful this Noble Phantasm becomes. By connecting the space near himself to Babylon with this Noble Phantasm, Gilgamesh can shoot out innumerable “Originals” of Noble Phantasms that come in a variety of forms, such as swords and spears.

Although the quantity of the contents that can be shot out is lower in comparison to what Gilgamesh in his normal state would have, from the way it seems, Kid Gil is choosing the Noble Phantasms that are to be shot out with the aim of observing his opponents properly in order to “strike at their weak points.”

# Enkidu: The Chains of Heaven
- Rank: ?
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~30
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

A Noble Phantasm crowned with the name of Gilgamesh’s one and only friend. One of the Noble Phantasms utilized through “The Treasures of the King”. Countless chains will bind the opponent in a moment upon activation. It causes a Paralysis status effect and sustained damage onto the opponent by means of binding. It is an Anti-Divine armament that was utilized in the legends – at the time of when the “Bull of Heaven” Divine Beast was being suppressed, thus the higher the target’s divinity aptitude, the more its power grows.

# Sha Naqba Imuru: The Omniscient and Omnipotent Star
- Rank: EX
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: –
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

Sha Naqba Imuru (He who Saw the Abyss). Hero King Gilgamesh’s mentality, which reaches every corner of the world like the radiance of the stars and sees through all of creation, sublimated into a Noble Phantasm. A Noble Phantasm of the Constantly Invoked-Type. Not to mention an opponent’s True Name and Noble Phantasm(s), it can definitely see even a truth hidden underneath multiple layers without obstruction and with a single glance. Although it is in a state where it seems to be constantly invoked, one can also assume from appearances that some parts of the Noble Phantasm’s ability are being intentionally limited.

If its True Name is released, it will operate as “instructions” for Gilgamesh to guide himself and others with the most optimum tactics according to the situation presented to him, simultaneously increasing the offensive power and defensive power of his whole team near his own position as a result.

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronoun: boku
Second Person Pronoun: anata
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / ○○-san

## Personality

‘His nature is cruel and heartless. A tyrant who does not comply with the people’s opinions and treats only his own standards as absolute’————such disposition does not hold true for Gilgamesh in this form. He, who has materialized with the figure of a boy’s, strongly possesses the mentality from around the time when he was called a wise ruler in the past, and he basically behaves as a polite and modest boy. The women he has a liking for are of a type similar to “flowers that bloom in the fields.”

## Attitude Towards Master

Gilgamesh might be prone to attaining even a fragment of the truth regarding the demise of human history. Still, he does not speak of anything about it. Rather, he is only watching over the Master’s battles and smiling. It seems he is not reluctant to lend even his support in the likes of combat, but even so, he will merely not talk about anything that concerns the “truth”————

## Dialogue Examples

“What to call me… That’s right, please casually call me, Gil.”

“Please think of me as just a child, and also, please tell me anything you want me to do, ok Master?”

“Not too simple, nor too showy. Hey, do you think making around this much adjustments is the most different aspect about me?”

“Wouldn’t it be better to do the things that should be done before long?”

“Growing up, huh?... Say, I have mixed feelings about that…”

## Historical Character and Figure

Uruk’s Hero King. Mankind’s oldest Hero. The demihuman, demigod King who governed the Sumerian city-state Uruk around the 26th Century BC. Kid Gil is completely the same person as the Heroic Spirit of the same name.

It is not certain in “Fate/Grand Order” whether Kid Gil is truly “Gilgamesh” – the one who materialized with his usual appearance – who became much younger by eating the wonder drug of rejuvenation, or whether he truly materialized with this figure from a much younger stage of his life since the beginning.

## Standard Weapons

Kid Gil shoots magic swords by means of his Noble Phantasm “The Treasures of the King”; shooting attacks. The quantity of the contents that can be shot out is lower in comparison to what Gilgamesh in his normal state would have. The shooting is done not with the majestic style where both of his arms are usually crossed, but with a relaxed style where he clearly stands still.

Kid Gil has more mixed feelings than usual when it concerns the adult Gilgamesh.

## Comment from the Illustrator

He is fundamentally Kid Gil from hollow. There was even a plan for the size of the armour in Gil-kun’s Third Stage Ascension where it matches with the dimensions of his body, but then it appears as if this is much more better for the small child impression, right? Thus, the armour and cloth that are of the same size as the adult Gilgamesh’s are floating by his hips with a mysterious power. There is the impression that when he walks normally in Chaldea, it looks like he is slowly dragging his mantle along. (Tenkuu Sphere)
