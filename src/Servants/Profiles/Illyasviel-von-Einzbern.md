## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [B]**

A powerful magic boundary granted to the transforming Illya.
Invalidates magic with chant 3 verses or less.
Unable to defend against large scale magic such as great thaumaturgy and ritual spells. (ok this line is weird because this is description for MR C, not B, so i assume misprint. for MR B peeps, it is hard to injure them even if you use great thaumaturgy of ritual spells)
Furthermore, during her transformed status her physical protection, healing acceleration, and physical ability and such are strengthened, exerting an effect to each of her status.

**Infinite Magic Energy Supply: [C]**

A literally infinite supply of magic energy from the Kaleidostick.
But due to the output being restrained by the user's own Magic Circuit's ability, Illya still yet to be able to show the stick's original power.

## Personal Skills

**Pleasant-Type Mystic Code: [A]**

The self-proclaimed Ruby-chan. Formal name "Magical Ruby."
It is made by the old geezer sorcerer of the jewel. Within the sorcery stick dwells a natural man-made spirit.
Unnaturally obsessed with magical girls; although it supports its user, it stubbornly refuses to accept things other than magical girls.
As long as it's having fun, everything's fine. So, cheerful-type.

**Child of Nature: [B]**

A miracle born of her father, Emiya Kiritsugu and her mother, Irisviel, hoped to to live a normal life.
THose miracle and love is bundled within the pure Illya, granting a blessing unto her.

**Suspicious Drug: [A]**

Ruby-chan's handmade magic potion. Its effect is quite extraordinary, but you just can't have any confidence in it. At least until you drink it yourself anyway.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Quintett Feuer - Multiple Ensemble Saturated Bombardment
- Rank: A+
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1-100
- Maximum target: 1 person

Quintett Feuer.
In the 5th volume of the original works Zwei! it was fired at the deformed giant Gilgamesh and defeated him. A super output of magic energy bombardment that surpasses Ilya's own limit.
When invoked, she accept magic energy simultaneously from Kaleidosapphire in addition from Kaleidoruby as the foundation, the premise for "Kaleidoliner - Zwei Form". In this form, due to it falsely taking her own nervous system and blood vessel system and others as Magic Circuit, she must prepares herself for the giant toll on her body as a compensation. Truly an attack that risks one's own life.

# Character

## Pronouns

First pronoun: watashi
Second pronoun: anata/~san/~oniisan, oneesan
Third pronoun: ~san/minna

## Personality

A very docile, friendly heart. An exceedingly normal girl for her age. She has a sort of bad habit where, when it comes to her bestfriend Miyu and her stepbrother Shirou, she would get worked up and a weird switch is flipped on. As she drives herself to the wall, the chaotic condition reaches its peak and she ends up throwing away everything and just runs away.

## Attitude Towards Master

Revealing her confusion in Chaldea's current situation, she is continuously surprised by the environment with Servants surrounding her. But it it is for the sake of her friend and for the sake of those in trouble, she shall wield her power as a magical girl to her heart's content.
In regards to the Master, she takes to him/her as that of a reliable big sister/brother, and as long as it doesnt contradict her feelings she will diligently cooperate on her duty.

## Dialogue Examples

Illya: "Ruby, if you please!"

Ruby: "Alrigh~ty! Compact, full open! Illya! If you'll excuse me!"

"Fullpower firing (Fire)!"

"Rapidfire (Shoot)!"

"Slash (Schneiden!)"

"Of course magical girls can fly, right?"

"But, it's because this counts as a medical treatment, alright!? No feelings or interest involved whatsoever! ...Okay?"

## Depiction

An elementary schooler of Homurahara Academy year 5, class 1.
In the world of "Magical Girl Prisma⭐Illya" she resides in Fuyuki City.
She made a contract with the Kaleidostick Magical Ruby and became Magical Girl Prisma⭐Illya.
Due to her experiencing a division of Chloe, who is an offshoot of herself, from then on the surface of her magic energy had been weakened. But by means of detailed planning and an amount of good luck, she still carries her duty as a magical girl.

## Character in FGO

She made an appearance in the collaboration event of "Magical Girl Diary ~Prisma Corps~".
Although she separate her ways afterwards, following the bond between her and the protagonist she is summoned as a Servant of Chaldea.
But if that's the case, then is Ruby-chan existing simultaneously in the world of "Magical Girl Prisma⭐Illya"? Also, if Miyu the Magical Sapphire isn't there then how does she able to go to Zwei Form? Also, the heck is a Servant to begin with....?
Such and such questions infinitely arises, but don't think too hard about it. Said MAHIRO⭐. Seriously, just don't.

## Related Characters

**Chloe von Einzbern**

I must! Give my all! As the OLDER sister! But she is really reliable. But I have to say, she's also really cheeky! (last sentence is a bit confusing, might need a recheck)

**Kogil**

I think he is a bit scarier than the Gil-kun that I know? But still, Gil-kun is Gil-kun.

**Emiya**

Although you're being so cold, and although I and the "I" that you know are different persons, but I do know that you're watching over me. But I never thought you'd cry from eating a mapo eggplant... even though it doesn't taste any different.

**Emiya (Assassin)**

Uh, Mr. slightly-dark-skinned-professional-killer-who-looks-like-Papa-but-isn't-actually-Papa? U-Um, I think k-killing people is a bad thing to do!

**Irisviel**

Mmm, a goddess-like.... something... that looks like Mama but isn't actually Mama? Huh? There aren't really any change at all!?

## Comment from the Illustrator

Uniform -> normal form -> Zwei form. Because there're already stages of form change that fits the game system, curiously I didn't need to puzzled over it too much and just put the orthodox finishing touches. Because the normal form is the design from back then, I feel like some parts are really shoddy. But still, now that I have drawn for many years, I no longer fumble with the balance. The big mantle is a respect of sort to the first generation Kaleidoruby. By the way, Illya already has, like, 8 different battle costume already, so...wouldn't there be a Costume Dress unlock in the future? Please? (Hiroyama Hiroshi)
