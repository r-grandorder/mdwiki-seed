**Presence Concealment: [E]**

A Skill that erases one's own presence.
It is weakened due to the skill "Beach Crisis", but she herself doesn't really care about it.

**Beach Crisis: [A+]**

Attracting people's gaze simply by being at the beach.
Unlike Beach Flower, it even attracts gazes that doesn't count as yearning.

**Primal Rune (Sea): [A]**

A rune bracelet tied on her wrist.
Specialized on water or sea.

**Midsummer's Mistake: [C]**

It's not bad to merrymake once in a while.
Scathach who ended up with that thought may have lost the limiter known as going easy.

# Gae Bolg Alternative - Spear of Kick-Lunging Death Flight
- Rank: B+
- Type: Anti-Unit/Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 5~40
- Maximum target: 1~50 person

Gae Bolg Alternative.
It's is fundamentally a similar Noble Phantasm as the one she utilizes while manifesting as a Lancer. The form is largely different.
Cu Chulainn names it the "Kicking Bolg".
Accordingly, it is known as Scathach's most extreme forte, the special move of spearthrowing with her foot.

(ffffuuuuuuuuuck i hate so much how lunging kick sounds somebody help me come out with a new word that encompass both kicking stuffs and stabbing stuffs)

# Character

## Pronouns

First pronoun: watashi/washi *natural tone is washi, but sometimes after saying washi she will correct herself with "...watashi"
Second pronoun: onushi/omae/kisama/** (no honorifics)
Third pronoun: yatsu/kare/kanojo/** (no honorifics)

## Personality

Just the usual Scathach.
Is what one'd thought, but being on the waterside makes her a bit more high spirited than usual.
"Being festive in the beach once in a while is good."
Since she is in the mood for swimming in the ocean, she is dressing more stylishly.
Kind of like between a chief and a senior who acts slightly different from usual during a training camp. Basically, she's troublesome.
During battle, there are numerous times where she uncharacteristically covers for her allies.

## Attitude Towards Master

Since we're in the beach, might as well have some pleasant times.
You too. Go and enjoy yourself.

Sometimes she gives off the nuance that tells the Master to train, like "Why don't you do some laps, hmm?" But she stills says "Take a proper rest" too. Seems like more or less she is showing some consideration. However, once the Master is warmed up she'd probably urge him/her to endlessly run over the sandy beach until the end. Don't show any negligence.
Due to modifying her own spiritual foundation, Scathach's liveliness is as expected different from usual.

## Dialogue Examples

"Servant Assassin, Scathach, has descended here.
Mm. A dress for summer, I see. Or perhaps a dress for the beach?
Matters not. I am still me. Much obliged, Master."

"I might as well do away with this bind. Charmed as you may, but try not to show an unsightly demise, yes?"

"No excessive parts, I see. Easy to move around too. What's the matter? You know not where to place your gaze, hmm?"

"That is fine. A basic straightball; that is the way of the Celts."

"I shall get serious. Just a little bit."

## Historical Character and Figure

Completely the same with her Lancer manifestation.

## Character in FGO

The figure of Scathach who, for the sake of adapting in the uninhabited island, modifies her own spiritual foundation.
It's possible too for her to be different in style from her usual battle manner so that she can moves around easily. She will uses hidden weapons too. So, Assassin.

--Waterside means swimsuit.
--Nothing is strange at all. Yes, nothing at all.

Additionally, she may be an Assassin but her rank of Presence Concealment is quite low.
There's absolutely no concealment happening here.

## Standard Weapons

Spear, triple stick, beam arrow, throwing knife, dagger, longsword, kick, It's quite a variety.

## Related Characters

**Artoria Pendragon (Archer)/Tamamo no Mae (Lancer)/Kiyohime (Lancer)/Mordred (Rider)/Anne Bonny&Mary Read (Archer)/Marta (Ruler)/Marie Antoinette (Caster)**

Good, good. I see that the swimsuits are perfect match for each of you.

**Edward Teach**

Ah, you. Do not move. Stay right there. This will be over quick.

**Fergus/Cu Chulainn**

Have you prepared yourself? (with a large smile on her face)

**Queen Medb**

Haha. No need to glare at me so. I am not particularly trying to make you the odd one out. If you wish for it, would you like to change to a swimsuit too?
...What? You don't want a rehash?

## Various Design Elements

**Bracelet**

As per Scathach's special characteristic, rune letters are engraved on the golden bracelet. The opposite side is the same as this drawing, but turned 180 degree. Because the craftmanship is a bit too small, I'm fine with it not showing in the action model (sprite).

**Hair ornament**

Going for Azalea impression.

**Gold chain**

In the thin gold chain (on her left hand) there is 1 stone , 2 set each.
in the gold chain (on her right feet) there are 2 small stones and 2 big stones, 2 set of each.

**Throwing knife**

Eleven throwing knife surrounds her thigh.

## Comment from the Illustrator

I'm pushing it up. Following the setting in that she is well acquainted with many weapons, she has plenty of choice of arms. I consider her decided direction to be the triple stick Bolg. It's a regret that I don't really know about Celtic braided ornament. (Koyama Hirokazu)
