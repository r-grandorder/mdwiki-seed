Eye of the Euryale.

The charm of the goddess, capable of turning heroes into captives by a single blow, taking form as a Noble Phantasm.

On her bow, her bewitching charm; on her arrowheads, her sweet, sweet whispers. An arrow that will shoot down the hearts of any male, be they a human or a god.

Its appearance is truly divine. Also cute. A golden bow patterned with heartmarks all over it.

Say, isn't that the God Cupid's... is what her younger sister was about to say before meeting a terrible fate.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First pronoun: watashi
- Second pronoun: anata
- Third pronoun: kare/kanojo

* She calls Stheno "watashi (Stheno)" for both second and third pronoun

## Personality

A beautiful maiden, purity and chastity themselves given form.

Her character is free and unrestrained, her action without concern, her smile overflowing, and her words and deeds pure.

The perfect goddess, the ideal woman.

A "cute maiden" who thoroughly behaves spoiledly and makes men cares about her. Beautiful and adorable things, she freely and unconditionally loves; while ugly things, she unconditionally hates.

At least, that's how she pretends to be-----

The truth is, although she is endowed with purity and chastity, at her core one can say that she is extremely sly and capricious. She thinks that as long as she keeps quiet about it no one will get mad, and that it's not a fraud if no one knows about it. (ALthough she would end up on a self-loathing afterwards.)

She possesses a sort of timidity, one that differs from her other self (Stheno).

She gives off a bit of a tsundere feeling.

Particularly, even though she bullies her younger sister Medusa together with Stheno whenever possible. In truth, she loves her. She truly loves her.

## Attitude Towards Master

She shows her smiling face towards the Master in a pleased manner.

But to tell the truth, this is due to her enjoying watching someone on the path to ruin. With the Master being the first human she had laid her eyes on ever since a while, she wants to observe his/her suffering to her fill. For her to force unreasonable demands is a matter of course.

Only those who manage to overcome this bargain sale of unreasonable demands are worthy of actual conversation with her.


She has no wish towards the Holy Grail.

If she is compelled to think of one, it would be to "return to the place where the three sisters once were", but she already knows. That it is nothing but a wish that would never come true.


## Dialogue Examples

"I am Euryale. Mm, yes, I am indeed a goddess. Although yours would be a short life, do your best to make this most enjoyable for me, alright?"

"I don't care much about Medusa. ...Although, well, I suppose a servant is necessary."

"Now now, hurry up and come out. I (Stheno) had just received such a lovely gift. Just for today, I shall share it with you. "

"I detests noisy people. To say nothing of violent ones. ....No. I just, hate people."

"You are prepared to fall for me, of course?"

## Historical Character and Figure

She has no ability to fight, and she is unable to survive on her own.

The eternal maiden, unable to live without accepting help from others-----

The second daughter of the three Gorgon sisters from the Greek mythology.

The embodiment of men's yearning, she is a goddess born as the perfect idol.

The same with the eldest daughter Stheno, she was once one of the gods of ancient Greek. Normally there is no way for her to be summoned as a Servant, but for some reason she manifested anyway. She is truly weak, possessing practically no combat prowess, but her Noble phantasm is exceedingly powerful in a certain sense.

Helplessly weak in exchange for eternal beauty...such is a goddess she should have been, but due to becoming a Servant she becomes somewhat stronger.

The Gorgon sisters were originally the same existence, so naturally Euryale and Stheno are eternally identical existences as well, connected together. Existing in a similar way with a certain kind of collective system, they call each other "me".

(The third daughter is an exception; she ended up growing and becoming different in height and build, her heart losing her connection with them.)

## Concept
An ancient idol.

As a genuine idol, she demonstrates the problematic characteristic of "combat ability being of no use whatsoever, yet filled to the brim with only beauty".

## Related Characters

**Stheno**

Her other self.

She calls her as she calls herself, "me".

**Medusa**

Her beloved younger sister. She actually really loves her.

On the surface she calls her "mere slave" and "Meduseless", always bullying her. Her younger sister definitely fears her. And yet...

When Medusa was exiled to the Shapeless Isle by the twelve Olympians, she went together with her, as if it was only obvious that she would do so. She had continued to harbor no fear towards her sister, even as Medusa was gradually changing into a grotesque monster, and met her for the last time.


**Asterios**

The boy who had turned monster.

He reminds her of Medusa, and for some reason she just can't abandon him.


## Comment from the Illustrator

As I was thinking of making them to have same hair color but different clothing detail, I thought what if "the two who I would've normally spend time to mirror trace each other" becoming slightly different little by little? So I had the elder big sister's clothing layer to face inward while hers to face outward. I wanted to use anemone and cyperus for her headdress' flowers, but although I want to split the latter in ones and twos, it became too hard to prepare it, so I ended up with the simple motif instead. She gives off a refreshed feeling comparatively (in contrast with the elder big sister).

(the whole thing is this: ヘッドドレスのはなに二輪草と三輪草, 後者を二つと一つにわけて使いたかったのですがうまく仕込むのが難しく単純なはなモチーフにな っています, 比較的スッと気持ちを出してくれそうな姉様のイメージです and it was long and some parts I'm not sure I get right so if somebody got a better rendering of it Im all ears.)
