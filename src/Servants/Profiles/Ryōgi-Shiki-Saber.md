## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [A]**

No matter how powerful the spell is, any magic below rank A will be nullified.

**Independent Manifestation: [C]**

Special skill. Enhanced version of Independent Action.

This skill signifies a confirmed existence. Those with this skill have resistance to instant death and time-control attacks. Said skill is normally restricted to...

**Connection to the Root: [A]**

All existence originates from 「 」 and follows 「 」.

Separating the Ryougi, rotating the four phenomena, and assembling the eight trigrams. Revealing the truth of the world. The Ryougi is the yin-yang of the taijitu. Her name comes from the "shiki" of suushiki and the "shiki" of shikigami.

In other words, the mark of an all-powerful wish machine. For those who possess this skill, regular parameters become meaningless.

## Personal Skills

**Mystic Eyes of Death Perception: [C]**

The rank is lower compared to her Assassin counterpart, since she doesn't need them originally.

**Cloud Shine: [B]**

After switching one's attitude to that of a swordsman, the user performs ultra-high speed movements and slashes. Five intervals... nine meters of space are instantly covered, as if a flash of light.

**Yin Yang: [A]**

Raden of Yin and Yang. In order to remember an existence, one must abandon the existence. In order to save an existence, one must forget the existence. Longing and return are two sides of the same coin. Just like life and death. Paradox Spiral. This Shiki recovers HP by losing NP.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

## Personality

A deeper level of consciousness, created from Shiki Ryougi’s dual personality.

A female personality, in her late twenties. A calm and understanding older sister.

The Shiki who grew until the late twenties and has begun to give out maternal charm.

One may get the feeling that she’s detached from worldly affairs, but actually, she simply has no sense of crisis, as everything is like “part of Shiki's dream”; for her, everything is taken in as “a view across the glass”.

The image of “A goddess who descended on Earth through some sort of mistake”.

An oriental goddess rather than a western goddess. Though her aspect is close to the Merciful Bodhisattva, her underlying personality is that of a meanie. One could say she is an Impish Bodhisattva.

She denies the view of human nature as fundamentally good. “Since humanity at its core is evil, things tends to turn out for the worse” while sighing, “So please do your best, ok?” cheering mankind’s stubborn endurance with a supportive smile, for that is her stance in the matter. Truly troublesome.

## Attitude Towards Master

Although she was summoned by an odd coincidence, she decides to follow you as a good servant. Almost like a pleasure trip, so to speak.

For she who could neither be found nor talked to by anyone, what exactly could come out of this temporary rendezvous?

## Dialogue Examples

「Servant Saber, Shiki Ryougi. I have come forth, to answer your summon.

Fufu, I wonder if this is okay? I know I'm rather peculiar, but I'm pleased to meet you, Master.」

「Everything is a dream 一 These are the flowers which are left behind」

「It’s fine to change your blade. A beautiful sword will remain good no matter what kind of grip it has.」

「I am a Servant. Whatever happens, I will follow and obey any orders Master gives. After all, this seems quite entertaining.」

「What I like? Of course it will have to be you who has summoned me, Master. Even if this is nothing more than a fleeting dream.」

「To tell the truth, I do not sleep. That’s why I'm always lonely during the night. As if I’m lacking something, it's quite frustrating. But as a side benefit, I am able to look at your sleeping face. It would’ve been great if I could appear in your dreams and protect you there as well.」

## Character in FGO

The woman whom we’ve gotten a glimpse of during the irregular singularity, the Boundary.

She wears a bright clear kimono with graceful gesture, showing discernment, but full of affection. This defines her routine even in abnormal situations.

Due to the uncertainty of her own existence, she wishes to remain uninvolved in strange cases, even when she knows the details about them.

A distinguished individual one would not normally meet. But— in the opposite case, it would be on a snowy day, while everyone is asleep.

She’s the same person as Shiki Ryougi, the girl who wears a jacket over her kimono. However, their personalities are different.

If Shiki Ryougi is the girl known as 「Shiki」, then this person is the woman known as「Shiki Ryougi」

The personality of the body itself, embodying 「 」 that represents the beginning.

She slumbers within Shiki from her birth to her death.

Shiki can't perceive 「Shiki Ryougi」, and 「Shiki Ryougi」 will never take Shiki's place.

## Related Characters

**Mysterious Heroine X**

「She is so cute. By the way, I want to cut her.」

**Minamoto no Yorimitsu (Raikou)**

Since we are both sword-based servants, it would be nice to have a bout with her.

I can sense the influence of the demonic self residing on her mind. Somehow, I relate to that feeling.

**Xuanzang Sanzang (Sanzou)**

Shiki can't hold her excitement after hearing about priest Sanzou.

「If I'm not mistaken, that's the Buddhist fist style from Nyorai-sama himself. Well then... can you catch my blade with your bare hands?"」

## Comment from the Illustrator

Initially, I thought of choosing Shiki’s appearance as a young wife as seen in Mirai Fukuin for her Third Stage, but considering that it seems a little different from FGO’s concept, I did a new design for a perfect expression of the Princess Kaguya motif. Hence, the pattern of her uchikake uses a pattern identical to the one on Silicon Princess’s uchikake in Tsuki no Sango. (Takeuchi Takashi)
