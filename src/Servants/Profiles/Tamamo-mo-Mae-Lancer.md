## Class Skills

**Riding: [A]**

Talent for riding. It is natural for the Lancer class, but it feels like the rank is very high.

**Divinity: [A++]**

Wakemitama (bunrei) of a divine spirit...or avatar, or incognito...that is what supposed to be. But this is the result of summer. Shining like the sun on the beach! As if that sexy pose is the normally suppressed Divinity. What is going on, good wife fox?

**Territory Creation: [A]**

What “trauma from the past”? Summer beach is my hunting ground, needless to say it’s the power to create territory. Be elegant at any time and any place, the beach parasol is not just for show.

## Personal Skills

**Beach Flower: [EX]**

Is she really the incarnation of a sunflower? Attack power of allies are raised and additional effects are granted for male Servants. Her figure is just like a goddess of summer. “No no, I am an actual deity right?”

**Midsummer Witchcraft: [A]**

Powerful charm ability. Although the enemy suffers from various debuffs, at the same time charge gauge increases due to their mood being lifted. A skill that requires getting used to, but a very powerful and convenient skill when used right (1). Turning demerit into merit!

**Goddess Metamorphosis: [B]**

Highest form of Shapeshifting skill. User transforms into a goddess, gaining a feast of buffs. But then she is stunned afterwards. Apparently there was a holy woman in a certain cyberspace who acquired this Skill (2). Incidentally, Tamamo's Divinity has casually became A++, but that is because her aspects as Amaterasu leaking out under the summer sun modifiers, or something like that.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Everlasting Summer Sunlight - Sunshade Parasol of Master's Most Favorite Deity
- Rank: C
- Classification: Anti-Unit
- Range: 4-30
- Max target: 1

Tokonatsu Nikkou - Hiyokegasa Chouai Isshin.

"Sunshade" is something drawn as a "charm against evils spirits". It is filled with a prayer of eradicating the bad bugs that stick to the master. In a certain other world, it is also called "Polygamist Castration Fist". Of course, it is a special attack against males. For detailed story, Robin Hood is (probably) well-informed. During the Noble Phantasm animation, there is an exclusive bust portrait, and Tamamo-chan is happy “Such gorgeous Noble Phantasm, yay me!”. But a year later, a surprise situation arrived. “Of course it’s me! ☆” (3)

# Character

## Pronouns

First pronoun: Watakushi/Kochira/Tamamo-chan/Watashi (when talking to herself)
Second pronoun: Anata/Sochira/〇〇-sama
Third pronoun: Anokata/Sonokata/Minasamagata

## Personality

Even when she wears a swimsuit, as expected, she’s still the usual Tamamo-no-Mae. But thanks to being in a vacation, she has completely exhausted her magical energy, turning into the beast of summer. That is the reason for her abnormally high physical ability. Perhaps due to having full flexibility and leeway, she seems to be more refined and high society than the usual Tamamo. She’s under the assumption of being an elegant mannequin herself. But a true elegant lady wouldn't cheerfully carry a swim ring with intention of playing around.

## Attitude Towards Master

While she appeals her beauty as a woman, this doesn’t mean she’s making love-traps whenever she has the chance. When it comes to summer・beach・parasol, it’s about the chance to showcase her refinement. A strategy of putting up more charms than usual, so that the other party is already madly in love by the time they return to their ordinary days. "Instead of a lady, isn't she a hunter?" "Yup, exactly, Master. Despite being the Original, she is the Tamamo-no-Mae who stuck one foot into the Tamamo-Nine... hunter of the sea, aka Tamamo Shark." (4)

## Dialogue Examples

“SUNSHINNNNE!” (“Hottt!” nuance) *When got hit with enemy Noble Phantasm*

“Beneath the umbrella, a beauty gazing wistfully at the far horizon... Aah, what ennui! This is the sunset summer beach seen in dreams. Now, there are no more regrets... ...No, I've still got a lot.”

“Ah... Summer will be over... Though there's still things I really want...but it might be good to leave it at that. Thank you for playing along with my selfishness, Master. ...These memories will always... Forever... Will be recorded in the Tamamo-chan Album. If you forget... It's going to be scary☆!”

## Character in FGO

When talking about summer, it is the beach.
When talking about beach, it is the parasol.
When talking about parasol, it is yours dependable miko-fox.
This is, surely, the common sense of the Ashihara no Kuni...! A solar explosion.
With wet T-shirt and a swim ring as her weapons, Lancer Tamamo-chan, shining like the sun on southern countries!
...To understand her enthusiasm, let me explain. Tamamo-no-Mae is good-wife aspirant miko shaman. She was a peerless beauty who served Emperor Toba as his most favored court lady at the end of the Heian period. She was also said to be the Golden Fur White Face Nine Tailed Fox and the bunrei of the great goddess Amaterasu in the Throne of Heroes. Having that much of a career, it might be fine to live a life of enjoying a vacation in the southern countries…is what Tamamo-chan thought.

## Related Characters

**Kiyohime (swimsuit)**

Kiyohime-san has a naginata..! Though originally she was someone with a Chinese flavour, now totally has the taste of a luxury Chinese cuisine takeout huh...Ah! Naginata, doesn't it overlap with my parasol?

**Martha (swimsuit)**

A fist-fighting cleric with long black hair... Ugh, my head… Oh well, that's Martha-san for you. Tarasque-san, try your best to survive, okay?

**Kiara Sessyoin**

Just thinking about her already gives me headache, Nope!
Eh, principal deity (5) or not, I don’t hate selling style argument. But it’s better that she should have some self-restraint. No, it’s not like that’s a problem in my perspective. Once she shows her true nature, the amount of sharp and wicked language will also increase, right?

**Nero (swimsuit)**

Wh..why are there homing lasers shooting out of your theater!?

## Comment from the Illustrator

See-through! You can see-through her shirt! Since the weapon is the above item called parasol (spear), this time the mood is extremely high when she’s by the summer sea. ❤Grab everything❤Triangle bikini~straw hat~towel~and of course the swim ring too❤That’s just like Tamamo. Not enough cornflake puffs in her beer jug in the final ascension? I was told that and now I really want to go back to add more (taste)... (Wada Arco)

## TL Notes

(1) Gameplay advice basically.
(2) Kiara.
(3) Swimsuit Nero talking.
(4) Tamamo Cat talking.
(5) Shingon Buddhism reference. Kiara's sex cult is a branch of Shingon so Tamamo is the principal deity of her cult.
