## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [A]**

Artoria Ruler possesses an extremely high magic resistance, invalidating the effects of most magecraft.

**Territory Creation: [B]**

The skill of the swimsuit blademaster to create their own casino.

## Personal Skills

**Royal Bunny: [A]**

Look at the thing shining above the king's head, what is that! Ears like that of an animal!
Could it possibly be some kind of curse or the grudge of the howling Beast Glatisant (唸る獣, "Growling Beast")[1] that appeared in Britain long ago, which now afflicts King Arthur. How terrifying, the growling beast[1], oh, to bare its fangs at the king even after the passing of hundreds of years…  
ー Nay, that is incorrect. Our king has simply come to harbor an interest in the thing known as bunny girls.  
Oh? Then that getup, could it possibly be.
ー Yes. A costume.  
So that's it.

**Royal Card: [C+]**

That which the King seems to be a throwing does not appear to be a kind of dagger, no. Is that a card? — Yes. As a casino dealer, one must be exceptional in the handling of cards, as per the king's decree. Is it not a wonderful skill.
At times, I have heard this place called as a casino being as for amusement.  
— That's right.  
Though the manner of throwing seems as if she has the intention of annihilating enemies in mind.— Perhaps it is something as intended to drive off inebriated guests and the like.  
Is that so…

**Knight of the Lion: [B]**

It is said that in the past, Sir Ywain fought alongside a lion.
Thus, it is no wonder that as his liege, our king, is able to command a lion of light. Or possibly, at the time of the Saint Graph changing, the King purposefully selected as her own the skill that should have been originally possessed by Sir Ywain.  
― That may also be the case.  
Yes.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Be Brilliant, Mine Hall of Radiance
- Rank: A+
- Classification: Anti-Army
- Range: 1~99
- Maximum Number of Targets: 300 people

Bright Ehangwen.
The high mobility great hall Ehangwen that conquers the surface of the waters is temporarily materialized, firing a super-large magical light unto the entirety of the enemy camp, it is the greatest attack of the Swimsuit Lion King, Artoria Ruler.
It is unclear whether the Ehangwen of the past had this sort of navigational or bombardment capabilities, though from her manner of speech "while it has never done it before" "there is nothing it can’t do" or something similar to that regard.
On the other hand, in relation to the bombardment, there are suspicions such as "isn’t it actually the installed Rhongomyniad doing that" and "isn’t it actually the same Noble Phantasm as when you were a Lancer." Concerning this matter, she remains silent and says nothing at all.

## Pronouns

First Person Pronouns: watashi  
Second Person Pronouns: anata / sonata / kisama / kikō  
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo

## Personality

Fundamentally the same person as when she was Lancer.
However, because she is off duty she subconsciously thinks that she can spread her wings a bit, and her speech and conduct are a little lax in areas that are unrelated to the Swimsuit Blademaster Official Bout.

## Attitude Towards Master

Fundamentally the same person as when she was Lancer, but...
The Master is not a swimsuit blademaster, so they are carelessly caught off guard (油断している, "being careless/unprepared").
To be more specific, the percentage of smiles showing is slightly higher than usual [when they are a Lancer]. Though only just a little.

## Dialogue Examples

"Now then, let the duel commence (デュエルスタート, lit. duel start)"

"To be honest I'm actually dressed as a rabbit, could you tell?"

"Oh, you've noticed then. Yes, that's right. This umbrella is a different modified form of Rhongomyniad."

"Casino Camelot, isn't it so. It feels more like a garden than a castle. Castles are meant to function for battle, but gardens are supposed to be a space for repose. You too, please feel free to relax and make yourself at home."

## Character Image

Swimsuit Lion King.
There are three meanings behind that name.
First, the manager[2] of Casino Camelot, the apex of the five great casinos which reign over dazzling Las Vegas.
Second, the organizer of the bout match of the Swimsuit Blademasters — Tournament of the Seven Swimsuit Blademasters, who watches over the swimsuit blademasters competing with their swimsuits and their swords for a single summer’s memory.
Third, Lancer Artoria, who has changed into a summer outfit.
Please note, this is a completely different individual from the so-called "Lion King" or "Goddess Rhongomyniad."

Since the foundation of the Saint Graph is from her time as Lancer, she is still a heavenly/divine Heroic Spirit close to (being) a Divine Spirit, or Goddess.

Her class is Ruler.
Of course, it would be a class for the purpose of arbitrating the match of the swimsuit blademasters.

Furthermore, her favored horse Dun Stallion is not by her side as she is no longer a Lancer.
The white horse has not disappeared, having been sighted resting in the stable area of Chaldea. What about the magical energy to manifest within the present world? That remains unknown.
Though she no longer has her favorite horse, she instead has come to control a lion of light.

With her natural competitive intuition, insight, and mental fortitude, she reigns as Vegas’ strongest dealer.
Before her, any foul play is seen through, and any lucky player are brought to their knees.

The Swimsuit Lion King, Artoria Ruler, intends to enjoy this vacation to the fullest.
This is a rare occurrence.
Because, fundamentally she is a Heroic Spirit who is always combat-ready at all times, never off duty, and diligently and earnestly keeps on fighting.
However, concerning that...
due to the mischievous machination of the mysterious older brother Merlin, she has become a Swimsuit Lion King who tackles this vacation with all her strength.

Master must be mindful.
She is serious.
With her usual solemnity (overly serious demeanor), once she has made up her mind about enjoying the vacation earnestly, she would absolutely not cut any corners at all.
Now then...with your whole body and soul! Play!

## Standard Weapons

Card Attack (1st and 3rd) / Attack with Parasol (2nd ascension) / Attack with Radiant Lion (appears with EX attack in each ascension)

**Swimsuit Hokusai**

Novel swimsuit blademaster.
How will she fight and how will she shine?
I had high hopes・・・ and she has lived up to them.

**Swimsuit Blademasters**

Fufu. Really, all of them are highly skilled/peculiar people (くせ者).
It's been a noisy summer vacation, but judging from Master's expression, it seems they all did a good job.

**Knights of the Round Table**

The knights who gathered for the sake of managing the casino. Their loyalty, is splendid.
However they truly did work well.
I'll have to think of a bonus.

**Moriarty**

You're a fine bartender.

**Arthur Pendragon**

Apparently, he had a sentiment he wished to share concerning bunnies, but it was terribly inarticulate.
Wait. Finish what you were saying, Arthur!

**Mordred**

Hm...?

**Jekyll**

I humbly ask for your continued support.

**Gareth**

(I want to stroke her head to my heart's content, but I cannot because I am worried about the knights of the round table around me)

## Comment from the Illustrator

The first ascension was a bunny, and the second ascension was a swimsuit...it was a natural progression, but I had some trouble deciding on the third ascension, I listed several candidates and waited for Takeuchi san and the management's direction on the matter. I expected it would be something like an armor dress, but the response that came back was "bunny armor dress with a card funnel" ...am I...a genius after all. The lion proposed in the rough idea draft (アイデアラフ, aidea rafu) was also accepted as a method of attack, and the ship design for instance as well was something I had never experienced before, but it was enjoyable being able to illustrate it.

## TL Notes

[1] Questing Beast, or the Beast Glatisant (Barking Beast), is a monster from Arthurian legend. It is the subject of quests undertaken by famous knights such as King Pellinore, Sir Palamedes, and Sir Percival. The strange creature has the head and neck of a snake, the body of a leopard, the haunches of a lion and the feet of a hart. Its name comes from the great noise it emits from its belly, a barking like "thirty couple hounds questing". 'Glatisant' is related to the French word glapissant, 'yelping' or 'barking', especially of small dogs or foxes.

[2] Shihainin (支配人, "executive/administrative manager") is an authorized representative of a company or unincorporated business under Japanese commercial law.
