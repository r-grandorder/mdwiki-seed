## Class Skills

**Territory Creation: [C]**

Creation of a territory that is advantageous to himself as a magus.

However, what he creates is not a Workshop, but a Study to spin stories.

**Tool Creation: [-]**

This Skill is lost due to his inherent "Enchant" Skill.

## Personal Skills

**Enchant: [A]**

Bestowal of concept. It adds powerful function on others or their properties.

Fundamentally, it is a strengthening ability with the purpose of making the Master fight.

He himself watches over the battle as an audience, irritating the Master as he inquires the Master's psychological state.

**Self-Preservation: [B]**

In exchange of having no combat ability, as long as the Master is safe he is able to escape from most dangers. In other words, he himself never fights at all.

Yet for all that, he himself is fond of high risk high rewards type of tactic.

**King's Men: [C]**

The Globe. A miniature magic version of Shakespeare's Noble Phantasm, "Let the Curtains Rise to Thunderous Applause."

Unlike his Noble Phantasm, it doesn't consume much magic energy. It summons shadow actors without any combat ability and manipulates them at will.

Shakespeare is the one that decides the shadow actors' lines, but the shadow actors themselves automatically imitates the target in regards to the lines' details (such as the tone of the lines or how it is said), so there is no worry of exposure on that part.

Even if one understands that the shadow actors are fake, it requires a powerful force of will in order to break this magic.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# First Folio - Let the Curtains Rise to Thunderous Applause

- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~30
- Maximum target: 1 person

First Folio.

The ultimate play that Shakespeare unleashes.

Regardless of friend or foe, the target is made into someone that appears in his plays. On top of that, the target is then thrusted with challenges. Of past regrets for heroes, and of moments of their fall for anti-heroes.

An anti-mind Noble Phantasm that breaks the mind of any and every hero.

::: tip
* as people would probably already know, First Folio was a collection of Shakespeare's play post his death. Its actual title was Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies, but modern scholars commonly calls it First Folio. It was printed in folio format and contains about 36 plays.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First pronoun: wagahai
- Second pronoun: anata
- Third pronoun: kare/kanojo

## Personality

Wagering everything on the works that he writes, one can say that he is a writing junkie.

Fundamentally, he holds no interest on anything other than "things he finds to be interesting", and he detests mediocrity.

Falling into either side of good or evil, he sometimes even wishes to write about the tragedies on his own allies.

Not even a single virtue in him... and yet at the same time he is not wicked. Truly a neutral existence that could fall to either side of the scale of good and evil depending on which is more amusing.

## Attitude Towards Master

He does not attend to the Master with pure sincerity in mind.

To begin with, his natural style is one that supports the Master, a type of Servant that does not really show himself.

In addition, he detests mediocrity and is fond of disturbance. It is the same way in regards of how he treats the Master; preferring an all-or-nothing, sink-or-swim type of gamble over a steady plan.

In other words, the component that he desires from a Master is "a combat ability that is comparable (or if not, then at least a Mystic Code that is comparable) to a Servant" and "a stormy life full of drama, one with accomplishments as a hero, be it falling to a tragedy or a comedy".

And obviously, a Master possessing such components is decidedly rare in this days and age.


## Dialogue Examples

"Caster, Shakespeare! Have arrived here! Now then, shall we enter the beginning of this tale!?"

"The thing I hate is decidedly obvious! I absolutely loathe ordinary ones. For they are no more than rabbles, easily manipulated by the likes of Antonio!"

"May your tale is met with a blessed ending! May you face your path with strength, no matter what tragedy befalls you! And should your tale becomes a comedy, may it ends such that anyone would stand in applause!"



## Historical Character and Figure

Perhaps the most famous playwright in the world. Even in the history of England, there are not many authors who managed to gain pupoularity that equals those of heroes.

Not only in England; even in Europe, Asia, or America, there are probably nobody who do not know of the name Shakespeare or his works; "Romeo and Juliet", "King Lear", "Macbeth", or "Merchant of Venice". To say nothing of his numerous quotes, such as "To be or not to be; that is the question" or "O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"; there are probably only a very small amount of people who have yet to heard of it.

In the present era, the first edition print of "First Folio" that had survived amounts to roughly 200 copies. Its value would change depending on the damages on it, yet it still ranges around aproximately three to six million British poundsterling* each.

...Be that as it may, while it is an evident fact he had written numerous of works, it is also a truth that those works had influenced roughly every "stories" in the modern world.

To add, he himself is an eccentric exceedingly fond of stories.

Just as he is fond of tragedy and drama, regardless of good and evil.

He is ever in embracing the hope for the Master and for all the others connected to him.

A hope for their story, yet to be seen, yet to be heard, and yet to be known.

...And somewhere in his heart, he embraces the faint envy in something he has no other way to describe.

William Shakespeare is, too, a drama actor.

--To take the leading part, in a story filled to the brim with vicissitudes.

Perhaps, that is the very thing William Shakespeare desires of.

* it was 350mil to 750mil yen in the mats; convert it to british pounds because i felt like its more appropriate, and the amount corresponds to what i found for lowest and highest bid of a copy

## Comment from the Illustrator

Gaia whispers to me to keep on drawing, to class change him from a bit of an old man to fullblown old man! Ok, I guess the severity and stress of the manuscript deadline has really piled up on me. Now that I look at it, even the drawing of his last ascension looks like the face of a man finishing his manuscript while chugging energy drinks, all day all night. For his sprite, I really enjoyed giving it the finishing touches of the looks-quite-handsome-if-he-just-stay-silence-but-gives-off-bad-feelings-the-moments-he-opens-his-mouth nuance.
