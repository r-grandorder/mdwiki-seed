## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [B]**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done with a chant of three verses or below. One practically does not suffer damage from Magecraft even if it was a Great Magecraft or Ritual Spell.

## Personal Skills

**Imperial Privilege: [EX]**

Skills that essentially cannot be possessed can be acquired for a short time. The Divine Founder is almighty. The relevant Skills this covers are Riding, Swordsmanship, Fine Arts, Charisma, Military Tactics, and many others. Because this is not lower than Rank A, those that are a burden to the body (such as Divinity) can even be acquired.

At the time of being endowed with this Skill, Romulus is sealing his own Divinity Skill that he naturally possesses at a high rank.

**Natural Body: [C]**

The possession of a perfect body as a living being since birth.

It becomes possible for Romulus to temporarily rank up his Strength Parameter. Furthermore, even without training, his muscles are beyond brawny, so no matter how many calories he absorbs, even his figure will not change.

**The Seven Hills: [A]**

Romulus can grants blessings to those he personally recognizes as “his own children”.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Magna Voluisse Magnum: All Things Lead to My Spear

- Rank: A++
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~99
- Maximum Number of Targets: 900 people

Magna Voluisse Magnum (Deeds Not Words). The Spear of Nation Building. It was told that the spear was combined with the great tree that symbolizes Rome itself, the tree appearing in a dream that Silvia, Romulus’ mother, saw before she had given birth to Romulus by means of a virgin birth. At the occasion of the founding of the nation of Rome, it was said that Romulus thrust this spear into the Palatium.

As a Noble Phantasm, it is being endowed with tree manipulation abilities, and at the time of its True Name Release, the spear will transform/enlarge as the great tree that creates “the past/present/future appearance of the imperial capital, Rome”, washing away the targets according to a torrent of surging waves of trees. A mass weapon Rome.

# Moles Necessarie: All Things Lead to My Love

- Rank: B
- Classification: Barrier Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~40
- Maximum Number of Targets: 100 people

Moles Necessarie (Necessary Rocks). It materializes the anecdote where Romulus put to death his beloved younger brother Remus with his own hands as a rampart of love smeared in blood. It is a Barrier Noble Phantasm where a rampart appears and divides the space, protecting the inner part isolated by the walls. Since the appearance of the rampart suddenly rises up from the ground in an instant, depending on the coordinates of his current position, it is even possible for Romulus to cleave his targets with the rampart like a guillotine.

## Pronouns

## Personality

Because Romulus is a superhuman by birth, there is composure and presence of mind in him. That human nature is that of Rome itself, which reigns over the world. The Rome. All of Rome is the fruition of his very own flesh and blood, purpose, and destiny, and those who were born in Rome and those who died for Rome are equally his own children; in other words, he calls other Emperor Heroic Spirits related to Rome, such as Nero, Caesar and Caligula, “my own children” and loves them.

Towards Romans, Romulus is very kind. Even to companions who are not Romans, given that he interprets their nature as something “that exemplifies the world; in other words, that exemplifies Rome”, before long, he will come to interact with them kindly. That is to say, he is nevertheless kind to everyone.

Romulus usually has an air of composure around him, but he abandons himself to being crazy about blood to some degree and forgets about himself when he gets well into battle. He has an aptitude for the Berserker Class. When he is in a blood frenzy for a moment, he is out of control.

It is possible for Romulus to talk together with animals far and wide, and from the way it seems, the words are clearly understood by wolves especially since they are Romulus’ siblings whom were raised up together with him. (One cannot also deny the possibility of Romulus simply starting a conversation with animals other than wolves just to get into a good mood.)

## Attitude Towards Master

Rome is the world; in other words, the world is none other than Rome. If so, human history is also equal to the history of Rome. Surely because of that, the Divine Founder continues to offer his patronage to the Master who fights for human history.

“You too, are Rome!”

## Dialogue Examples

“I (Rome)… am (is) Rome.”

“My (Rome’s) hand can reach even the ends of the world, no matter what.”

“I see. You are Nero, huh? How lovely, how lovely; what a brilliant thing, are you not? The way you even nodded showed that you support Rome with those slender arms. Come, come. Past, present, future, all of Rome certainly loves you.”

“Behold. My spear, namely————me (Rome), is here.”

“Your birth. That is also again, something produced out of Rome.”

## Historical Character and Figure

The Nation-Building Hero who appears in ancient Rome’s founding myth. Born between the God of War Mars and the beautiful princess Silvia, Romulus was raised by a wolf – which is a beast of the gods – as a friend.

After triumphing in the battle against Amulius, the King of Alba Longa who deceived his grandfather Numitor for the throne and persecuted his mother Silvia, instead of ruling over Alba Longa, Romulus established the city-state of Rome in the Italian Peninsula. And after overcoming the tragedy where he killed his younger brother Remus, who fought together with him in the Alba Longa War, with his own hands in a quarrel during the occasion of the founding of the nation, Romulus annexed the states around the Mediterranean Sea in an instant, building up the cornerstone of Rome, which will become a great empire that will boast a glory spanning over a long time.

The Great Nation Founding King. In his last moments, Romulus did not die, but rather had “disappeared”. After storms and lightning broke out suddenly at a field nearby the Palus Caprae (Goat Marsh), his figure was erased. Because of the words spoken by a farmer later on after Romulus’ disappearance, the people of Rome interpreted this anomalous phenomenon as, “The Great Romulus had arrived at the queue to become a god due to the intentions of the God of War, Mars, who is his father”, and that became the conclusive interpretation. The farmer encountered Romulus after his “disappearance” at Quirinal Hill, and from the mouth of the Great King of Nation Founding, he informed him that Romulus has now changed into a god referred to as Quirinus————It is said that this is what has been informed to the people.

Quirinus. That is the name of an olden god purported to be among the ranks of Jupiter, the Supreme Being spoken of in Roman Mythology, and Mars, the God of War. This anecdote was spread to the people of Rome, and this olden god was born again as a new god who became unified with the King of Nation Founding.

## Related Characters

**Nero**

“A child of Rome who is my own beloved child. The glory of Rome itself that was born brilliantly as well. A child endowed with the talent to obtain the embodiment of the genuine Rome.”

**Caligula and Caesar**

“Romans who are my own children… are ought to be loved.”

**Altera**

“A person who attempted to trample down Rome. However, that person is surely hiding Rome within her.”

“… It is a little weird for me to say it, but the heart of Rome’s Divine Founder is quite profound, is it not?” says Altera.

## Comment from the Illustrator

I just requested “I want to draw muscles”, and the responsibility for Romulus turned to me. Since I have heard that he will become the boss character in Chapter 2, I kept in mind of a way to show an air of importance to his frontal appearance so that it does not appear to consist of mere coloured clothing. His whole body being golden in his Third Stage is said to be Takeuchi’s idea. The posing of his battle sprite had came up with tremendous impact, and I was relieved that surprisingly, from the way it seems, they were generally able to accept it(?). Hey, I also happened to draw something that does not look like a gigantic spear? (Koyama Hirokazu)
