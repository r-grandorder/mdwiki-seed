## Class Skills

**Mad Enhancement: [EX]**

Mutual understanding is perfectly established.

However, she sees the Master as 「the person she loves」, and forbids them to tell lies.

In the case of lying, she’ll certainly see through it no matter what kind of lie it is, and will automatically consume one Command Spell.

「———— You are lying, right?」

## Personal Skills

**Shapeshift: [C]**

Borrowing bodies and molding them. She was reduced to a venomous snake by a woman’s determination, and crossed a large river.

Can transform into a low grade Oriental dragon. She’ll run with all her heart as long as she has legs, but when her legs disappear, she’ll start crawling around on the ground. She will also exhale flames. What’s going on?

**Stalking: [B]**

A skill to continue pursuing the beloved target.
With something that includes the five senses and mana, and that should rather be called a wild instinct, she chases after Anchin everywhere.

**Flame-Colored Kiss: [A]**

What Kiyohime seeks from her Master. If their lips lock once, she’ll get rid of any hindrance, and will be willing to turn into Super Kiyohime-chan.

As a compensation, the definition of the Master’s future (groom) will be seized, but it’s a trivial risk.


## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Tenshin Kashō Zanmai -Flame-emitting Samadhi of Transformation [1]

- Rank: EX
- Type: Anti-Unit (Self)
- Range: 0
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person

Tenshin Kashō Zanmai.

A serpent that spits flames. In other words, transformation into a dragon.

Each turn, either a constricting or a fiery attack is performed.

The constriction is a direct and single-target attack.

The flames are a ranged mass attack with a maximum range of 10.

Still, it’s not as if she inherited blood from the Dragon Kind.

What is here is just a persistent, firm conviction on the man that lied to her.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First person pronoun: わたくし (watakushi)
- Second person pronoun: あなた様 (anata-sama) (only to Master) / あなた (anata) (the others)
- Third person pronoun: あの人 (ano hito) / あの方 (ano kata) …

## Personality

Basically so calm that she’s dyed in madness, she can converse so flawlessly that most humans wouldn’t think of her as a Berserker.

However, she’s not interested in the whole world, and only recognizes that it’d be good if there were only 「her」 and 「Master」.

Also, her biggest concern is 「whether Master loves her or not」, and she’ll forgive with a laugh being popular enough to have a harem, but if they enter a specific route with someone that isn’t Kiyohime, she’ll aggressively stare with empty eyes, really scary.

## Attitude Towards Master

Of course, she’ll treat them with ardent affection.

Gently waking them up in the morning, staying at their side at noon, and diving in the futon and gently whispering 「Good night」at nighttime, she’s a devoted Servant, ri-ght?

## Dialogue Examples

「Servant, Berserker. Thank you very much for having summoned me. Ah…… I finally found you. Dear……」

「Thank you very much. It’s fine, my Mad Enhancement skill is not an important thing. Thank you for your concern」

「―――― Lies, right? That isn’t good, Master. It’s true that she’s more cheerful and lively than me, and she matches Master’s tastes. But, you certainly said you loved me. Unless you disprove it, that love is a distorted ostentation. I shall take one Command Spell. Next time, please use it yourself. Otherwise ――――」

「My trigger is lies. When I’m lied to, my own heart boils irremediably. That’s why, I love you, Master. Please, may you not lie」

「―――― You are a liar, right?」

## Historical Character and Figure

Knocking at the temple of Dōjōji

Under the temple’s bell A hidden body

Anchin Kiyohime Turned into a snake

Coiled seven times One turn One turn [2]

---

——— Liar, liar, liar.

The beautiful (yandere) heroine that appears in 「The Legend of Anchin and Kiyohime」. That’s Kiyohime.

While the beautiful monk Anchin proceeded to the main Kumano shrines, he sought the inn of the elder of the Masago, Kiyotsugu to spend the night. The daughter of Kiyotsugu, Kiyohime, had her heart trembling for Anchin’s beauty, and sneakingly visited him at night.

——— You and me, are tied by fate.

Although Anchin, whose body was to serve Buddha, rejected Kiyohime, Kiyohime stubbornly didn’t acknowledge it. He, who was at a loss, promised to stop by when he returned from visiting the Kumano shrines.

——— Weren’t you the one who promised to reunite?

However, Anchin broke his promise with Kiyohime and traveled without stopping by Kiyohime’s place.

Kiyohime, who knew this, truly took the form of an oni, and began the chasing of Anchin.

——— If you didn’t love me, it was fine to say you didn’t love me.

——— It would have been fine not to leave any regrets.

——— It would have been fine if you rather killed me.

Anchin was horrified at the hateful her that kept glaring at him, and ran away to escape.

The girl that shouldn’t be able to chase a good walker priest, kept pursuing him through tenacity alone.

Resentment, grudge, bitterness ——— The accumulated emotions soon changed Kiyohime into a bizarre appearance.

In order to tenaciously chase him, she grew a tail and her legs disappeared as she lost her human form.

Although Anchin somehow reached Dōjōji and fled into the bell, Kiyohime, who had turned into a giant dragon, spit out flames and pressed hard against the bell with her entire body, and burned Anchin to death.

But Kiyohime, who burned him, without being able to return to be a person like that or to reign as a Phantasmal, committed suicide by drowning while shedding tears.

Anchin was unaware of being loved until the end.

Kiyohime couldn’t understand her violent feelings until the end.

——— Aah. Why didn’t my love go well?


It is also said that the couple, who were held a service by the priests of the temple, became tennin.[3]

## Related Characters

**Elizabeth**

Lacertid, beaded lizard, Komodo dragon, and countless other insults.

**Tamamo no Mae**

E-pal. I often suggest her to meet offline, but for some reason she has something to do and it doesn’t go well. For both, the advises that often consult each other about were off the mark.

## Comment from the Illustrator

The originator of the yandere that fell in love with Anchin but burned him to death for deceiving her. The Kiyohee that everyone loves. Since the game character of Kiyohime already is here and there with black hair and Japanese clothing, I thought about trying to make her completely different, and tried a more Western design covered with a yandere atmosphere. At the beginning there were lots of design ideas in which she was dressed with something like a jūnihitoe, but I told the boss about opening fully the thighs after drawing while balancing the numbers and it resulted in the current shape. Actually, when I listened to one battle voice that has been stored, I thought it was definitely charming but it was helplessly put on hold, but… At that time I thought that was awful but thinking about it now I feel there wasn’t any problem (lol) (BLACK)

## TL Notes

[1]: Samadhi is a state of mind in which you're super-concentrated on something. 
<ruby>Zanmai<rt>三昧</rt></ruby> also refers to "being immersed/absorbed in something". Quite fitting for a yandere.

[2]: This seems to be a fragment of the original legend. I couldn't find any good translation, so I tried to do it on my own

[3]: Tennin = Celestial person. The official translation is vague, so I transcribed it literally like with "oni" to avoid You's rage.
