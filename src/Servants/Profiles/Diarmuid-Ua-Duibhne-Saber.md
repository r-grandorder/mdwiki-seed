## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [A+]**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that are Rank A or below.

Modern mages would not be able to wound Diarmuid with their Magecraft.

It was originally Rank B, but it is being raised up to Rank A+ due to the effect of one of Diarmuid’s Noble Phantasms.

**Riding: [B]**

One can freely handle all vehicles and beasts except the Phantasmal Kind.

## Personal Skills

**Magical Burst (Jump): [A+]**

Having been raised by the gods, Diarmuid acquired superhuman jumping power. Having materialized as a Saber, he possesses this Skill in exchange for his Agility Parameter being lower when compared to the case where he is a Lancer. By emitting Magical Energy, his mobility explosively rises, raising his overall offensive power as a result.

**Honour of the Knight of the Fianna: [B]**

Diarmuid’s incomparable resolve. The unwavering mentality of a chief knight given shape.

**Love Spot: [B]**

Seduces those of the user’s opposite sex by means of a beauty spot tinged with Magical Energy.

A female who confronts Diarmuid will bear a strong feeling of love for him. Evasion is possible with the Magical Resistance Skill. Even if one does not have Magical Resistance, they can abate it to some extent so long as they maintain a will to resist.

(Diarmuid’s control over this Skill is effective under this Saint Graph in “Fate/Grand Order”.)

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Móralltach: Surging Seas of Fury
- Rank: B
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~20
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

If one were to nominate the most powerful armament among the many armaments Diarmuid Ua Duibhne handles, it could be none other than this fearsome magic sword. Bringing certain death in one blow – bringing certain victory on the first strike. This unsheathed magic sword bestows certain victory to Diarmuid and brings about defeat and death to his opponent.

This sword, as if it can manipulate even fate, was gifted to Diarmuid by Manannán[1], who was to the Celts the God of the Sea and the Otherworld. Manannán was surely the deity who bestowed Noble Phantasms such as Fragarach to the Sun God Lugh and an existence who owned and offered Noble Phantasms in great numbers.

After making use of a super jump that goes beyond human understanding – which became apparent due to his materialization in the Saber Class – Diarmuid executes a falling attack at the moment of its True Name Release. At this occasion, Móralltach becomes three blades – resembling even the “legs of the god Manannán” that were spoken of in legends – and cuts the opponent to pieces.

According to anecdotes, it is said that Diarmuid would carry the magic sword Móralltach and the magic spear Gáe Dearg when betaking himself to adventures where life and death truly hung in the balance, and in cases where he judged the danger of the trip to be little, he would take the magic sword Beagalltach and the magic spear Gáe Buidhe.

————When Diarmuid died, the equipment he had been carrying was the latter set.
If Diarmuid went into the mountains with the former set of equipment, the Demon Boar would have been killed, and he might have lived a long life.

# Beagalltach: Rippling Waves of Passion
- Rank: B+
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

A defensive Noble Phantasm. One of the armaments gifted to Diarmuid by the Sea God Manannán. It takes the form of a short sword. Diarmuid uses this sword not as his main weapon, but as his sub-weapon. It is a defensive Noble Phantasm that increases Diarmuid’s own defensive power, while simultaneously, it raises his overall combat performance when he handles it alongside his First Noble Phantasm – the magic sword Móralltach.

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronouns: ore / watashi
Second Person Pronouns: kisama / ○○ (without honorifics) / anata [kanji characters] / anata [hiragana characters] / omae
Third Person Pronouns: kisamara / ○○ (without honorifics) / kare / kanojo

## Personality

A noble Heroic Spirit who is fervent with loyalty and endowed with faithfulness. Although Diarmuid is basically the same person as when he was a Lancer, his self-awareness as a “knight” has particularly gotten stronger when he was summoned as a Saber. He enjoys battling formidable enemies and is not afraid of what others may think of himself in pursuing such things. Whether he is aware of it or not, his self-esteem is somewhat stronger when compared to the times where he was a Lancer.

## Attitude Towards Master

Basically the same as when Diarmuid was a Lancer.

Even regarding the Holy Grail, Diarmuid does not intend to use it for himself from the way it seems. In the case that he obtained the Holy Grail in battle, he would have the intention of presenting it to his master as his supreme goal.

## Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Saber. Knight of the Fianna, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. Allow me to serve you as a knight.”

“It’s disappointing, but whether I’m equipped with swords or with spears, I’m a hero who will surely be serviceable to you. The likes of a field I’m not very good in doesn’t exist for me.”

“Master. I shall devote this battle to you.”

“Let’s depart now, in accordance with chivalry.”

“Ah… O’ Knight King. I want to be a witness to you once more…”

## Historical Character and Figure

A robust knight who makes free use of two magic spears and two magic swords. A peerless handsome man who was raised by the Sea God Manannán and the Fairy King as well as the God of Love Aengus. Diarmuid Ua Duibhne was the best knight among the Knights of the Fianna whom were led by Fionn mac Cumhaill, and it is said that he greatly played an active role in the united front between the knight order and the Fairy King Abarta. The tale of the blighted love between him and Princess Gráinne is even said to have become the model for the later tale of Lancelot and Guinevere.

On this occasion, Diarmuid has further materialized with the Saint Graph of a Saber. This is because he considers not only spears, but also swords as his strong points, and yet… in this Saint Graph, his aspect as a “Mythological/Legendary Hero” has been strongly emphasized, so perhaps since he possesses several Noble Phantasms that were owned by the gods, the cost/difficulty level regarding his summoning is higher when compared to the case where he is summoned as a Lancer. (Still, if specific conditions are not satisfied for his Saint Graph, it would not be established and will end up vanishing like mist.)

Diarmuid’s Noble Phantasms are the twin magic swords Móralltach and Beagalltach. During the times he was a Lancer, he also possessed Skills that were apparently sealed. In legends, it is said that Diarmuid chose to equip himself with one magic spear and one magic sword at a time, but just like how he was equipped with “paired spears” as a Lancer, he got “paired swords” with him as a Saber. Once he is summoned, there is no doubt that he will flourish as a powerful knight of the “two-sword style”.

## Related Characters

**Artoria (Especially Saber Artoria)**

Saber Diarmuid is delighted to meet with the Knight King again. Seeing that there are no legends in Pan-Human History where the Knight King and Diarmuid – the Chief Knight of the Fianna – encountered each other, one can conjecture that they have met in some Holy Grail War. Although they do not speak of the details… Saber Diarmuid dreams and smiles of the day where they can cross swords once more.

**Miyamoto Musashi**

Diarmuid is quite aware of Musashi’s existence. That is to say, is the reason because they are both dual blade wielders as one would expect?… Or perhaps… Is it because Diarmuid is experiencing over again the fate of a man being picked up by a woman?…

**Cú Chulainn**

A companion Diarmuid reveres. For the best master of swordsmanship among the Knights of the Fianna, it seems that the existence of the Great Celtic Hero from a different Cycle is about to be on his mind.

**Fionn mac Cumhaill**

A companion Diarmuid once served. Since he is strongly self-aware that he, as of now, is a Servant who serves the Master, Saber Diarmuid does not call Fionn “My Master”.

**Yagyuu Tajima-no-Kami**

A friend Diarmuid took up at Chaldea.

According to Tajima-no-Kami, he recalls his seven sons from his early years whenever he looks at Diarmuid.

## Comment from the Illustrator

As Diarmuid is said to be a Saber with paired swords, I at least did his image and design with a nimble look to them. In addition, I added to him armour, which plays a role in his appearance so that he appears like a swordsman. Even though I was nervous in being able to take and being entrusted with a handsome character like Diarmuid, I remembered that I drew him while silently praying to myself, “Become a handsome man~~ Become a handsome man~~!” However, although I assuredly drew him in advance by myself, the impression that Diarmuid and his Saint Graph is slightly at a distance from me is indeed there, and I even slowly came to ridicule myself for that.

## TL Notes

[1] – According to the common versions of the myth, Manannán actually gave Móralltach and Beagalltach to Aengus, who then gave them to Diarmuid.
