## Class Skills

**Madness Enhancement: [A+]**

Rank up for all Parameters, but snatches away most of one’s reason.

Since only Caligula’s sense of duty where he must expand more of the Roman Empire and make it prosper is not lost, in the situation where one seeks to make contact with him by revealing a reference to Rome to take sides with him, a Luck Check is conducted, and he restrains his rampage if the check is successful. If the contact happens from a figure who is related to Rome, a plus modifier is appended to the check. That is to say, if Nero or Romulus approaches him for example, to start with, Caligula will reliably succeed in restraining himself. However, given that the matter of being restrained is just him “changing into a standby status instead of rampaging around”, one can conclude that coming to a complete mutual understanding with Caligula does not prove to be feasible.

## Personal Skills

**Imperial Privilege: [A]**

Skills that essentially cannot be possessed by oneself can be acquired for a short time. The relevant Skills this covers are Riding, Swordsmanship, Fine Arts, Charisma, Military Tactics, and many others. Because this is not lower than Rank A, those that are a burden to the body (such as Divinity) can even be acquired.

**Sadistic Constitution: [A]**

A Skill that applies a plus modifier to one’s aggression in battle. Their sadistic nature will continue to grow to some degree should the battle drag on.

As it is close in nature to the Madness Enhancement Skill, Caligula cannot demonstrate this Skill to the fullest.

**Glory of the Olden Days: [B]**

The memories of the four-year period when Caligula lived as a wise ruler do not soften his insanity, but rather accelerates it. This Skill applies a plus modifier to his resistance checks against mental interferences and temporarily raises his Strength Parameter when attacking bare-handed, but every time Caligula uses these effects, he personally takes damage. His rampaging insanity makes his Spiritual Core grate.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Flucticulus Diana: Devour My Spirit, Moonlight

- Rank: C
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~50
- Maximum Number of Targets: 300 people

Flucticulus Diana (Rippling Diana). A wide range Mental Pollution attack that diffuses Caligula’s own insanity through the moonlight projected through the sky. The manifestation of his insanity was something due to the affection and divine protection of the Moon Goddess Diana (who is equivalent to Artemis of the Twelve Olympians)————This Noble Phantasm sublimated that legend. If employed on an opposing army for instance, a situation that is repulsive and even tragic would probably be born. Its primary usage requirement is “for the circumstances to be at night.” This Noble Phantasm’s effects do not apply to those that are related to the Goddess Artemis[1].

# Character

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: yo
- Second Person Pronouns: omae / ○○ (without honorifics)
- Third Person Pronouns: yatsu / kano mono / ano mono / ○○ (without honorifics)

## Personality

A complete sadist who is swayed by sadism. All enemies that catch Caligula’s eyes will become targets of tyranny and wickedness. (Fundamentally, with the disposition of a Servant, Caligula will not bare his fangs at his own faction.) Furthermore, because he fell into a state in which his self-restraint is ineffective due to the Madness Enhancement Skill, Caligula is unmanageable. Even if he speaks the human language, given that it is something like a beast’s roar, coming to a mutual understanding with Caligula is impossible. However, even in such a state, he likes Rome. He also likes Nero.

## Attitude Towards Master

Caligula is thought to be regarding the Protagonist as a Roman citizen. Because he likes Roman citizens, naturally, he likes the Protagonist too. Still, since he lost his reason as he is now, as expected, Caligula cannot come to a mutual understanding with them. Though one can understand to a degree that he is probably not loathing them.

The wish Caligula wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to get rid of his insanity.” If it is possible for it to come true, he wants to return————

To that time where he was once called a wise ruler,

To that time when he was reading stories to his younger sister’s beloved child, Nero, who was sitting on his lap————

A time from even before that moment where the Moon Goddess fell in love with him and overflowed his body with madness.

## Dialogue Examples

“My, conduct, is, in, my destiny.”

“Offer me, that, life!”

“Offer me, that, body!”

“Beautiful, ooh so… beautiful… I want to steal it, I want to indulge in it, I want to tear it up, and I want to excessively violate, with my whole body, all of the beauty that has become your purity, as if that purity was of a goddess’s! I, love, you, my younger sister’s dear child, Nero!”

“▂▂▃▃▅▅————!!”

※ Although he can pretty much enter into a conversation of words, given that it is something like a beast’s roar, coming to a mutual understanding with Caligula is impossible.

## Historical Character and Figure

Ancient Rome’s Third Emperor who possesses a legend of tyranny. A figure of the 1st Century. Emperor Nero’s uncle. At one time, Caligula vigorously stimulated government affairs, and it is said that he had received a lot of support from the people as a wise ruler.

## Character in FGO

At a certain time, Caligula’s mental state had transformed. Without waiting for deification by the statesmen of ancient Rome that one would succeed in acquiring after death, Caligula forced the people, with his tyranny and dissipation, to call himself a god while he was still living, having exhausted his wickedness and perversion to their limits. The people of Rome violently trembled from the sudden change of the Emperor, and unanimously whispered: “The wise ruler had already disappeared, and now, Emperor Gaius, no, Caligula, has fallen into madness.” The reign of the young Emperor who had gone insane did not last long. He was assassinated, struck by the blade of rebellion from the many people who chose to center their influence around powers such as the Senate. That reign was only four years. However, that name was deeply left behind in the people’s memories as numerous acts of atrocities.

According to the values of ancient Rome at that time, it is said that Caligula’s insanity was namely considered the same as “being loved by the moon.” That is————Caligula had received the affection of the Moon Goddess.

While he is an existence close to an Anti-Hero, the reason why Caligula materialized as a Heroic Spirit is unknown. Perhaps the reason was really a prank from a Divine Spirit who governs over the Moon, or maybe, the reason secretly exists in his insanity, where perhaps his spirit from around the time when he was once called a wise ruler was encouraged once again when the demise of human history was laid before him————

## Related Characters

**Nero**

The beloved child of Caligula’s younger sister. His niece. Caligula loves Nero. She is a blood relative of his, while simultaneously, Nero, being the Emperor who took over the next era of Rome back then, is a subject who Caligula ought to love.

**Caesar**

Caligula’s great ancestor. An ally who should also be called the genuine First Emperor. Caesar, who realized the foundation of Imperial Rome by accomplishing the Roman Republic’s subjugation, is a subject who Caligula ought to love.

**Romulus**

The exalted Divine Founder above all else. The whole Roman world originated from this person. Being truly the child of the God of War Mars, even though the likes of “Roman Emperors were deified after death” already, they cannot even reach this person’s feet.

**Altera**

Caligula feels an unpleasant presence…

## Comment from the Illustrator

The Roman Empire’s Third Emperor… Caligula is the uncle who loves Nero. If I remember correctly, I think he is the character I designed first in the beginning. ‘At any rate, he appears Roman!‘ I tried to make that impression become clear. Given that I was drawing while looking with a sidelong glance at Ms. Wada’s Nero, he does not feel out of place that much even if they are put side-by-side… I think. Berserkers; there are many cool characters whom fully come out with an aura, or more precisely, with some flashiness to them, but it is disappointing because it is common for them with their circumstances to not hold conversations, so their personalities come out a little bit weak.

## TL Notes

[1] – Should also be including Diana.
