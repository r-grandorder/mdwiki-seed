Cancels magecraft with a chant lower than two verses. Can’t cancel large spells, like High Thaumaturgy or Greater Rituals.

Cú Chulainn, who is the son of the Sun god Lugh, has high attitude as a Divine Spirit.

## Personal Skills

**Rune Magecraft: [B]**

Possession of Nordic Magic Crests, Runes, given from his mentor Scáthach. By using different Runes, strong and diverse effects can be used. Besides attacking, the main usages are effects proper of the Magic Resistance skill, effects of the Clairvoyance skill, effect of rising parameters, etc. These are all temporary, and can’t be used simultaneously.

**Protection against Arrows: [B]**

A defensive effect against projectiles.

**Beast Killer: [B+]**

A special effect against Demonic Beasts or wild animals. Cú Chulainn, who knows deeply about the nature of beasts, knows the way to kill them.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Gáe Bolg - Piercing Crimson Spear

- Rank: B/B+
- Type: Anti-Unit/Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 2~4/5~40
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person/50 people


Gáe Bolg. The spear of causality reversal. A crimson lance handed by his mentor Scáthach, as well as a certain kill spear technique.

It has two methods of attacking, an Anti-Unit thrust, and an Anti-Army throw.

Although it’s not as if it was being sealed, for whatever reason, Cú Chulainn doesn’t use it when attacking normally. Only when he is convinced he can give the target a decisive strike with his 『trump card』, he wields the crimson spear with a full-power True Name release.

## Personality

A coarse but likable man. He doesn’t talk about『who is at the top』 between good people or villains, but since his roots lean towards justice, he’s not mature enough to understand the unreasonableness of the world and the equality of good and evil. He’s also an animal tamer. Specially compatible with dogs and wolves.
Compared with the Lancer summoned with the same True Name, he’s equipped with heavy armor. But still exceeds the Agility parameter of 『that one』 with an A+. It’s not a performance difference of the body, but the youthful and proactive personality can be thought to lead to a slight difference.
His feelings and emotions regarding his mentor Scáthach occupy a somewhat bigger place in his heart than 『that one』 Lancer’s. It’s unknown whether it is due to youth or due to the season. Truly the unreasonableness of the world, is it impossible to recognize the equality of good and evil……

## Attitude Towards Master

He finds the existence of a Master challenged to restore humanity likable, and wouldn’t doubt to lend them his power. But, be careful. The reactions aren’t completely applied in the same way as with『that one』 Lancer with the same True Name.

## Dialogue Examples

「Ulster’s Cú Chulainn. Lancer. For starters, nice to meetcha.」

「The hound of Culann is me. Yeah, I’ll bite to death. The enemies, that’s it.」

「Just because we’re Heroic Spirits of 『the same hero』, it doesn’t mean the same one will always come. Whaat, you'll soon get used to it.」

「You, do you like any animal? I, let’s see ―― dogs, it is. Hounds in particular are good.」

「I don't really dislike it, but women always bring bad luck. But, a nice woman is attractive 'cause of that too. For real, ain’t there anything worse?」

## Historical Character and Figure

He seems to be the very same person as the Lancer with the same True Name, but ―― his body and personality are seemingly slightly younger than 『that one』.

## Related Characters

**Scáthach**

Compared to the homonym Heroic Spirit, his obsession with her is a bit stronger.


**Medb**

Perhaps because his feeling of annoyance when followed around is thinner, he doesn’t put a bad face even if she’s in front of him.


**Artoria**

…… A woman? The Holy Sword Wielder?

## Comment from the Illustrator

Before painting I thought the number of lines was bad, but it was bad after all. Konoe-san is the designer of the armor, but I was making many speeches in my head, like "what the hell is this, Konoe-san…?!" (Lol) (Nakahara)
