## Class Skills

**Presence Concealment: [—]**

Due to the Skill “Espionage”, Presence Concealment has been lost.

## Personal Skills

**Espionage: [A++]**

This Skill does not conceal one’s presence, but rather makes their very presence not feel like that of an opponent’s. It causes misunderstandings such as one being a familiar neighbour, a harmless pebble, a beloved person, and so forth.

Since it is at A++, as long as there is no indictment from her current ally faction, it is impossible to perceive any hostility from Mata Hari. However, the moment she starts to attack directly, this Skill loses its effects.

**Pheromone: [B]**

Pheromone is the general term for substances secreted/ejected from the insides of an animal’s body, and they cause an effect on the behaviour and physiological state of another specimen of the same race.

Without even passing through as a beautiful courtesan, Mata Hari can dissolve the wariness of men and women alike, and as long as she does not make a mistake in the approach of her conversations, she can probably even obtain information from the innermost circles.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Mata Hari: The Woman with the Eyes of the Day

- Rank: A
- Classification: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1
- Maximum Number of Targets: 100 people

Mata Hari (Eye of the Day). The realization of the legend called ‘Mata Hari‘; a brainwashing Noble Phantasm. By means of a bewitching dance, Mata Hari forcibly paralyzes people’s trains of thoughts. Ordinary people and Masters are a matter of course, but Servants who do not have Mental Resistance Skills and are not under Madness Enhancement also fall under this Noble Phantasm’s effects, regardless of their gender. A person who failed at their check will basically be Mata Hari’s puppet.

The effects last until the sun rises. However, because evidence of this Noble Phantasm being employed are not left behind, it can even be repeatedly used on the very same person. Also, in the case that a person failed at their check even once, they will bear a handicap on those checks next time and thereafter.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: watashi
- Second Person Pronoun: anata
- Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / ano kata

## Personality

Exceedingly cheerful, and maternal. Although her appearance is in the late teens – having the looks of someone who is midway between a girl and a woman, and no matter how crafty she is being too, Mata Hari will treat one as a “child” if they are of the opposite sex. However, said person shuns her own lack of fortune and her fate in regard to how fickle it is.

## Attitude Towards Master

Mata Hari is devoted to her Master… but she can say with confidence that, from her position, it is easy for her Master to become a somewhat dangerous person to her. (Especially even more so if they are of the opposite sex.)

## Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Assassin. I beg your pardon for I’m not a Hassan. That’s right. Furthermore, I’m sorry, but I’m… unable to fight.”

“… We’ll be most capable of breezing through it with Mata Hari’s way, right? So, let’s go with that. Call me Mata Hari, Master.”

“Tsk, tsk. Are you okay? Fine, try to tell me everything. It’s okay if the story I’m going to hear about is depressing, because I’ll be ready too.”

“Lend me your ear. I’ll secretly teach it only to you…”

## Historical Character and Figure

A female spy who suddenly and roaringly made a name for herself during the First World War. Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, also known as Mata Hari, was born as the eldest daughter of a wealthy household in Amsterdam[1], Netherlands. However, Margaretha’s happy days have signalled their end because of her parents’ bankruptcy. After the breakup of her family, Margaretha made an effort to study under the guidance of her guardian as much as possible to become a kindergarten teacher, but because her school’s headmaster had a blatant meddling affair with her, she was evicted by her guardian.

Thereafter, after her own marriage and divorce, Margaretha debuted as the dancer “Mata Hari” in Paris. Mata Hari is the Sun, the name standing for ‘Eye of the Day’ in the Malay language, and it seems that Margaretha has been named as such by her employer who was pleased with her exotic appearance.

Mata Hari shared the bed with a great number of people as not only a dancer, but as a harlot too. Some of her clients were foreigners whom visited Paris, some of them being high-ranking military officers, politicians, etc., and it is believed that at this time, she was operating behind the scenes as a spy.

… Regarding Mata Hari’s spying activities, no clear evidence could be procured. At the time of being 41 years old, Mata Hari was executed as a double agent of France as well as of Germany. However, both the French and German sides whom executed her did not particularly believe her to be a spy who extracted important intelligence, and it is even said that she was treated, at most, as somebody who sold secret information to some degree.

At any rate, being granted that, France took advantage of this convenient situation and just pushed all their military failures onto Mata Hari. Due to their inept military operations, and also because a scapegoat was presented to them, she was accused of being a spy who had leaked information on France, and it resulted in the existence of Mata Hari being carved into history.

There are various episodes that talk about Mata Hari, such as one where she claimed “There’s no man who could shoot me” at the time of her execution as she became naked, her beauty causing those nearby to go crazy for her, so the shooters wore blindfolds in order to avoid that, but those episodes were probably exaggerated as one would expect.

Was Mata Hari truly a spy, or was she just a common secret information broker? The original name of a beautiful woman trifled by fate has been completely forgotten, and only her usual stage name has become a legend.

**Boudica**

Being of the type of that nature, Mata Hari is not able to have a particularly close relationship with another Servant, but among other things, she is relatively on good terms with Boudica, who arrived at an untimely death much like herself.

## Comment from the Illustrator

You know, I agreed that it would be nice if I drew an erotic elder sister, so I designed one as this dancer and female spy. Mata Hari’s usual personality is full of positivity, so with that being the case, she does not make me have an impure feeling in designing her as such. Well, at first, it even looked like there was such a scene where Mata Hari attacks with the cloths on her arms…

Although I submitted various colouring plans for Mata Hari, there was even one among those draft plans where she has something like tanned skin. For her character performance, although she is regarded as someone extraordinarily difficult to use, I felt happy since I received numerous reports saying she had been raised up to her Final Ascension.
