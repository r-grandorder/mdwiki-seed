## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: watashi
- Second Person Pronoun: nanji
- Third Person Pronoun: kisama

## Personality

Atalanta is fundamentally stubborn because of the wish she has in saving all children in the world. Due to her nature of being brought up together with animals, she is an extreme realist except when against children. Her outlook on life and death is more severe than a human being’s, basically not showing any mercy towards the weak… provided that children are excluded.

## Attitude Towards Master

Atalanta embraces the grand desire of saving all children. Regarding that, taking an unsparing attitude even towards her Master, in the situation where she does not catch sight of them having a zeal in obtaining the Holy Grail, she will even slay them. Nonetheless, if one goes along with her entirely while respecting her dream, she will even probably hand over a golden apple to them… Well, speaking of faults, regarding unfaithfulness in comparison to other Greek heroes, Atalanta deals with that fault in a strict manner.

## Dialogue Examples

“Hmph, too slow. In that case, thou probably cannot keep up with me.”

“Master, thou hast to become faster than me on foot.”

“There is only one wish I want to make on the Holy Grail. A blessing for all children, please…”

## Historical Character and Figure

Atalanta is a huntress who appears in Greek Mythology and is the daughter of Iasus, the King of Arcadia. However, she was abandoned on the mountains immediately after she was born and was brought up by a female bear sent by Artemis, a virgin goddess who felt pity for her. Thereafter, Atalanta was discovered by hunters whom threaded into the mountains, and she also became a huntress later on.

Atalanta boasts to be the fastest among humans, and right after becoming one of the few female crewmembers on the Argo, she happened to meet the Hero Meleager.

Meleager was charmed by Atalanta, and he invited her to the extermination of the Calydonian Demonic Beast, but this resulted in giving rise to a tragedy right after this event. For the sake of exterminating this Demonic Beast that was dispatched by Artemis, who got angry with a king who was being negligent in offering her a sacrifice, Atalanta and the others exhausted their efforts in a desperate attempt to hunt down the boar. However, although Meleager pierced the finishing blow, he handed over the achievement of hunting down the boar to Atalanta, who was the first one to hit her arrow onto the boar, this being an act of good will towards Atalanta, or Meleager having thought that it is simply something that should be followed as a Hero.

Concerning the males————they held displeasure towards that, where they cannot grow to be simply tolerant and were saying that they possess skills greater than Atalanta, who is a female————A fight suddenly occurred between Meleager and his relatives, and Meleager was inflicted with a deadly curse.

Regarding Meleager, it is unclear what kind of feelings Atalanta had been embracing for him. However, she seemed to have watched the outcome of a man who decided to love her get dragged into a tragedy, while regarding her father’s persuasion to marry, she tried to escape the unreasonable demand thrust at her, but she could not accomplish that either.

As far as she is concerned, Atalanta exists as a symbol of purity for children while simultaneously, she is an existence that projected her very own former self. Although she was saved by the hands of the gods, it is nearly beyond redemption for the rest of the children. She, who materialized as a Servant, entrusts the salvation of children to the Holy Grail. All children throughout the world, far and wide————That quest is without any reward, and yet, even though she is aware that it is a difficult challenge that is close to impossible to accomplish, she will chase after that dream for eternity.

In addition, when she became an Argonaut, Atalanta had interactions with her companion Peleus, who is the father of Achilles. In regard to this modest young man, he cannot look at the egoism of heroes in Greek Mythology, and it was, among other things, an aspect for her to think about all right.

## Standard Weapons

The Bow of the Heavens (Tauropolos)… a large bow Atalanta received from the gods.

## Related Characters

**Heracles**

A member of the Argonauts. The strongest, the invincible, the almighty! It is difficult for Atalanta to approach Heracles for he is excessively powerful.

**Medea**

A member of the Argonauts. At the moment when she met Medea, Atalanta requested for a moment of time with her before long, and the memories with Medea (as a Lily) were touching lovely… And then, when Atalanta tried to converse with a samurai who happened to be casually nearby, she burst into laughter as she fainted in agony.

**Artemis**

The goddess Atalanta believes in.

“I’m okay, yea sweets art REALLY okay. No problem. I’m okay after all. I’ll bear with it. I’ll persevere.”

## Comment from the Illustrator

Only in this place, there are people saying that they’re poor at drawing characters with animal ears, isn’t that right?… Although, I think what everyone ponders about is, “What’s going on with Atalanta for the section where her normal ears are!? Four ears? Holes? Hey, anything else?” they said…

When I think about it, rather than saying she’s like this child or beast, isn’t Atalanta an insect or something? I’m thinking something like that. Atalanta is like that sort of insect girl (her mouth isn’t too bad), but doesn’t she seem to be presented as very cute? (Rin Kususaga)

## TL Notes

[1] – The Tauropolos mentioned here is The Bow of the Heavens. Atalanta has access to another Tauropolos while using Agrius Metamorfosi, known as Tauropolos: The Dark Bow of the Heavens.
