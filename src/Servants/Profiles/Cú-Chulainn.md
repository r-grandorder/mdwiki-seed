Cu Chulainn inherits the blood of the god of light Lugh, one of the Tuatha de Danaan.

## Personal Skills

**Battle Continuation: [A]**

He is bad at giving up. This is not a method[1] to preserve one’s own dominance, but simply the karma[2] that induces the pride of Celt warriors who does not stop fighting until their last breath. It's possible for him to fight even on the verge of death, surviving as long as his injury is not decisively lethal.

**Protections from Arrows: [B]**

Protection against projectiles.

As long as the shooter is within his visibility, he would be able to seize all manners of thrown weapons with his bare eye and deal with them. However, it is not applicable to super long distance direct attacks or attacks with extensive range.[3]

**Disengage: [C]**[4]

The ability to withdraw from battle.

It also returns disadvantageous battle to the turn it began (turn 1) and skill conditions to its initial values.

[1]what is even 生き汚い
I got 自分の利益や優位を保とうとする様と言う感じの意味 but could appreciate a second look from more native moonruners

[2]業
It’s a Buddhist term that means karma, but it can also mean deed, work, performance, act. I feel like karma is the more correct one here considering Cu is big on this sort of stuffs, but native moonruners do correct me if im wrong.

[3]add on info from CM3: He can deal with most projectiles even in conditions where the opponent cannot be visually seen. Even if the battle with Hasan Sabbaha, he cancelled the throwing swords hurled from the darkness. As long as the attack is a thrown type, he can avoid even Noble Phantasms, but he can't gain the effects of this protection with respect to wide range attack types where the attack range of the weapon explodes on impact, or a direct attack by a weapon that has simply long reach.

[4]just a trivia, but Restart or Re-engage is actually a closer translation.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Gae Bolg - Spear of Piercing Death Thorn

- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 2~4
- Maximum target: 1 individual

Gae Bolg.

Hitting correction +100. Upon hitting, adds the damage in proportion to the enemy’s HP.[1]

The spear of curse that would always pierce through the enemy’s heart once it’s thrusted. The thorn of certain death utilizing the demonic spear Gae Bolg.

Its true nature is the demonic technique, where the spear was unleashed towards the enemy after the spear had already struck the enemy’s heart. In other words, the reversal of cause and effect.

It is the “spear that possess the effect of already striking the heart, thus no matter what the enemy would do it would always pierce through it.”

Because the action is done after creating the result, neither defense nor evasion is possible against it.

In evading Gae Bolg, what needed is not high agility, but luck; the ability to change fate before Gae Bolg is invoked. The magical energy needed for this Noble Phantasm activation is low, and its extreme efficiency of killing in each blow makes for an excellent Noble Phantasm.

[1] Could also mean stamina or physical strength but wouldn't make sense on the context here and what we know of GB already.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First pronoun: ore
- Second pronoun: omae/temee/** (no honorifics)
- Third pronoun: yatsu/** (no honorifics)

## Personality

Even if one is a close friend of his, as long they are the enemy he would laugh on his own bad luck as he exchanges blows to death with them; even if one is the enemy of his parent, as long as they are allies he would persist in protecting them until the end of his vow. Such is how he lives, abiding to the characteristic way of thinking of the Celts warriors.

During battle, he is extremely pragmatic, not shying even from performing surprise attack from behind. He displays the heartlessness where, if ordered, he would even kill ordinary persons so as to seal their mouths.

He excels in defense, unparalelled in regards to Skills to survive combats.

By the same token, he has the temperament of an elder brother; one who is refreshingly wild yet helpful.

Rough, savage, yet affable; at his root, he is a frankly loyal and faithful man. Be they friend or foe, he would proactively chat those he likes, not discouraged even if he is ignored. Truly, the legendary protagonist of Celt mythology.

He has special regards towards dogs from the origin of his name as well as the geas (vow) from during his live. As such, he loathes when the word “dog” is said in an contemptuous manner.

His hobbies are outdoor activities, such as fishing, diving, and mountain climbing.

His favorite things are strong-willed women and reckless promises. Things he dislikes are roundabout plans as well as reckless promises. However, the ones he had deep connection with during his lives were mainly the latter.

His Noble Phantasm, which upon unleashed would always pierces the heart, the “Spear of Piercing Death Thorn (Gae Bolg)”. One can say that it is essentially a Noble Phantasm that symbolizes the distinctiveness of the Holy Grail War, with it being a conflict made happen by magic.

## Attitude Towards Master

From the perspective of a third party, the manner of his death during his lifetime may look like a tragedy, but he himself is consent in meeting his death.

Due to that, he has no particular wish to entrust to the Grail. If forced to say, he responds to the summon in order to challenge powerful heroes to a worthy battle.

However. Ironically, during the Holy Grail War that he had participated until now, there are numerous of times where he was given the mission that he did not wish for; reconnaissance.

One may well say that this is due to the Master’s plan, but it might also due to his high level of speed and close combat ability that are characteristics of Lancer Class.

While he would voice his complaint and discontent, at the foundation he is faithful towards his Master; even with complaints, he would performs his simple duties.

## Dialogue Examples

“I’ll be taking that heart of yours-----!”

“Let’s go. Accept this one blow as a tribute.”

“Don’t think we’re the same. I ain’t got any interest for a second life to begin with.
…..Well. Heroes are a bunch who mostly just ain’t got any interest for things like that.
We don’t really adhere to this world. We just persist in regrets of things we didn’t get to accomplish. Not like a greedy, vengeful spirit like you would understand.”

## Historical Character and Figure

A hero told in Ireland’s Ulster sphere of of Celt mythology, also known as the “Child of Light” due his father being the god of light, Lugh.

His childhood name is Setanta. During his childhood, he made the mistake of killing the watchdog of the mastersmith Culann. He then vowed to be his watchdog in its stead, becoming known with the name of Cu Chulainn which holds the meaning of “the hound of Culann”.

Growing up, he served the Ulster king Conchobar mac Nessa, winning the fame as the greatest brave warrior of the Order of Red Branch. When he was 16, he proceeded under Scathach, who ruled over the Land of Shadow. Learning under her, he was given the secret of leaping, as well as the demonic spear technique of Gae Bolg.

In the tale of Táin Bó Cúailnge, he fought alone against the army invading Ulster that had received an order from the queen of Connacht, Medb. At the end of his continuous days and nights of fighting, he was pressed with the contradiction of the vow (geas) to not eat dog meat and to not refuse hospitality; not only he ended up losing the freedom of his left hand, he also had no choice but to let go of his demonic spear at the behest of the poets. Under such conditions where he was not allowed to fight fair and square as a hero, he lost his life before long.

## Character in FGO

In the prologue, “Ablazed Contaminated City Fuyuki”, as well as fifth chapter, “North American Myth Great War E Pluribus Unum”, the different aspects of Cu Chulainn made appearances in classes besides Lancer.

Among others, Cu Chulainn and Queen Medb, whom he is deeply tied with, were both key persons especially in the fifth chapter; the scenario depicted of the warped love and hate towards Cu Chulainn, just like depicted in the Táin Bó Cúailnge. To add, her master also made an appearance as a Lancer; Scathach, the queen of the Land of Shadow and the one who gave her the demonic spear Gae Bolg. His personal quest depicted the world of the savage and purely violent worlds of the Celt warriors, of when Cu Chulainn was still alive.

## Depiction in past works

In Fate/stay night, he bears the devastating development of killing the protagonist straight from the beginning. There is also a route where he becomes a dependable ally; although, it is a development that inherits Fate/stay night prototype short story’s development where the three knights of Saber, Archer, and Lancer ends up fighting together with the protagonist. In Fate/hollow ataraxia, he sets up a fishing line in Fuyuki’s harbour, as he accompanies the protagonist while telling of his personal experience during his life.

He also appeared in Fate/EXTRA series with a SF-ish look.

## Related Characters

**Scathach**

The master he respects. ….Although, he secretly worries for her. “Really, is this woman gonna be ok like this?” If this gets out, he’s totally getting ripped through pieces.

**Celt Servants**

The elder brother figure Fergus is obvious, but he is also deeply tied with those whose generation (cycle) came after him, such as Finn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid. However, he does feel that they sure are somewhat more gentlemanly compared to those of his own time.

**Emiya**

About time to settle the matter for good. Aggressively.

**Medb**

“She has always been a pain in the ass of a woman, but really? This much?”

## Comment from the Illustrator

Just like Emiya, his third stage ascension does not really differ from the original design. We go with the concept of “if he is designed at present time”. Upon consideration, I wonder if I should have made some more modification. (Takeuchi Takashi)
