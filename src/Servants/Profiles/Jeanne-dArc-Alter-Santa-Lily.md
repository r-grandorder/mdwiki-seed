## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [A+]**

Due to becoming Alter Santa Lily, the Magic Resistance Skill that she lost as an Avenger is restored.

## Personal Skills

**Saint's Present: [C]**

A Skill gained by virtue of completely turning to Santa Claus.
Giving away presents enriches the heart.
She may still be inexperienced, but her attitude of giving it a serious effort in anything perhaps makes her valuation as a Santa to be same rank as Santa Alter.

**Self-Reform: [A]**

Normally a Servant summoned on her heyday, but she is exceptionally summoned as an existence that "will grow from now on".
She would become evil if she desires evil, become good if she desires good.
Perhaps her future is not a bright one, and still the light of the saint will be bestowed upon her should she wish for it.

**Ephemeral Dream: [EX]**

A Skill that took to the extreme the dream brought forth by an individual's desire, and furthermore even the absurdity brough forth unconsciously by the dream.
At any rate, her fate that she would disappear one day would not change.
And yet, even knowing that she still desires of the door that leads to the sea.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# La Grace Fille Noel - Sing with Grace, of the Holy Birth
- Rank: A+
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum target: 10 person

La Grace Fille Noel.
An anti-unit Noble Phantasm that forms a pair with Howl, Mine Rage.
It doesnt invalidate enemy's buffs, but instead strengthen one's own encampment.
On top of that, it also drives an attack to the enemy.

As if heaps of present falling down from the sky, it truly can be said as blessing itself.

# Character

## Pronouns

First pronoun: watashi
Second pronoun: anata (neutral gender)/anata (female usage)
Third pronoun: kare/kanojo

## Personality

She acts like a grown up, but when she got confused she goes into panic and ends up crying. She herself insists that "I'm not crying!", but no matter how you look at her she is definitely half in tears.

She wants the Master to spoil her, but due to have never done anything of the sort, she becomes at loss on what to do and then cries again.

She is comparatively indifferent towards the other Servants, with the exception of those saint-type Servants and especially the childish, children Servants. Her favorite phrases are "Are you and idiot!?" and "Refutation!" and such.

## Attitude Towards Master

She puts in great effort to come across as a "Servant who puts her act together", but since she is still a child she still wants to be spoiled.

## Dialogue Examples

"Servant, Lancer. Jeanne d'ArcAlterShantaLily! N-No I didnt bite my tongue!"

"Everybody, please pull yourselves together! It's really troubling when you all act so slovenly. You are making it hard for the others!"

"Sob.....sob... uuu! I-I'm not crying! I'm not!"

"Now, time to work as a santa! I am going to do as much as I can!"

"Now it has been proven that you are a slovenly adult. A perfect refutation!"

## Historical Character and Figure

...Jeanne d'Arc enters the pages of history at the age of 17. Consequently, before that she is a girl of a countryside farmer family working hard, and there is no other record of her besides that.
Although no one would deny her faith and piety, she did not display any sort of wondrous miracle until she was 17 years of age.

## Character in FGO

The current Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily is born as the result of filling the nonexistent past of of Jeanne d'Arc (Alter).

However, because a saint takes part in it, the attribute of "person of firm character" is put in, and because she is a child the attribute of "crybaby" and "spoiled child" is also put in, resulting into "a kid who overstretch herself as a spendid adult".

## Standard Weapons

A spear.

## Related Characters

She is not going to become that sort of adult.
She so swear. To be more specific, the sort of adult that flip the table out of anger from losing at a party game!

"Don't remember. My secretary (Gilles) did it."

The aspiration as her true self. She calls her "original me", pulls on the sleeve and has her spoil her.

## Comment from the Illustrator

Actually originally the design is for Jeanne Alter Santa, and I had already finished up to rough design and all, but then Nasu said "Hmm, we need more twist." I took that into mind and wandered off on reworking her, and thus she is born.
Personally, I think that Amakusa being her teacher is her greatest charm (moe?) point. Isn't this like, how the protagonist's old rival takes care of the protagonist's child and like, teachs her everything he knows sort of development!? (Takeuchi Takashi)
