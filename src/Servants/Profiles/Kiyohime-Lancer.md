## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [D]**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done in one step (a Single Action). A Magical Resistance of the same degree as an amulet that rejects Magical Energy.

**Madness Enhancement: [EX]**

“Ha? No matter if I’m a Lancer or a Berserker, I’m still absolutely choosing to yearn only for Master wholeheartedly, so I really don’t happen to know anything about the likes of Madness Enhancement?”

## Personal Skills

**Blazing Summer of Passion: [A]**

Summer is the season of passion.
“I’ll spend this season several times sultrier than usual.”
Hot.

**Bathing Transformation: [A]**

Even though traces of the Berserker Class still remain, Kiyohime manifested in the Lancer Class. However, it resulted in her wearing a swimsuit as compensation. It is slightly embarrassing, but she is even willing to wear a swimsuit if it is for the sake of the Master.

**Pursuer of Love: [A]**

A powered-up version of the Stalking Skill.
“I! Love! Youuu!”

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Doujou-ji Kane, Hyakuhachi-shiki – Karyuu-nagi (Doujou-ji’s Temple Bell, Method 108 – Fire Dragon Mower)
- Rank: A
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

Kiyohime summons the bell that Lord Anchin once confined himself in, and according to the eloquence of Kiyohime herself, since Lord Anchin did not come out from the flames, she decided on also trying to stab some naginata in there this time… Perhaps it is, more or less, in the category of being called a Noble Phantasm that is viewed as a realization of that incident during her lifetime.

Furthermore, although there should be no particular connection, every time this Noble Phantasm is put to use, Blackbeard always complains with “But it’s terrible to lie heavily on the stomach with chills, a shortness of breath, dizziness, a headache and a sore throat!”

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronoun: watakushi
Second Person Pronouns: anata / Master [hiragana characters]
Third Person Pronoun: ano kata

## Personality

Although the same Kiyohime as always, she is somewhat positive… positive…? She feels like playing towards that orientation. The gloomy part of her state of being has disappeared due to the summer heat.

## Attitude Towards Master

Like usual, Kiyohime greets good morning to the Master first thing in the morning;
like usual, Kiyohime sits next to the Master in the cafeteria;
like usual, Kiyohime comes to give the Master the towel she has if it were the case that they took a shower;
like usual, Kiyohime will get into the Master’s bed if there is space;
to sum it up, like usual, Kiyohime will not come to anyone but the Master.

However, in the situation where there is Berserker Kiyohime as well, this will consist of two Kiyohimes instead.

## Dialogue Examples

“Kiyohime-chan’s great victory! Just kidding…”

“That… I-I want to do that sort of thing called holding hands with our fingers interlocked and… Ohh… I’m so happy…! That being the case, more than holding hands, this is what they now call husband and wife!”

“Love! I! You!… I’m—Out—Of—Sync!!”

## Historical Character and Figure

It is no different from Kiyohime’s time of her as a Berserker.

## Character in FGO

It is no different from Kiyohime’s time of her as a Berserker… But, the only thing one should be careful about is that she still exists as a Servant – that she is a Heroic Spirit of the past (and that she is still an Anti-Hero). With how much common sense one has, one even understands that an appearance like hers is the standard at the waterside; even so, as far as Kiyohime is concerned, for her own body to be in a swimsuit, it is possible to say that this is surely insane for her… Declaring that to be an easy understanding however, she changed into a swimsuit, and concerning her, given that in itself is the result of her having mustered her courage, one should give praise for her openheartedness, please.

## Standard Weapons

A naginata (it is something part of a maiden’s taste somehow).

## Related Characters

**Kiyohime (Berserker)**

“If we multiply as we are, that being the case, won’t this complete an absolute encirclement that won’t let Master get away?”
The Kiyohimes are suspicious.

**All of the Cú Chulainns**

“I’m thinking of treating him as the midway target.”

**All of the Artorias**

“I’m thinking of treating her as the final target.”

## Comment from the Illustrator

‘I also happened to receive requests that are full of variety, such as for kimono-styled swimsuits, school swimsuits and bikinis, so I guess I will specially do some drastic designs for those people based on the modifications of her attire!’ I completely conveyed all of those requests when I drew the designs for Kiyohime. AAlthough I thought the first Kiyohime wanted the second one to be cheerful and was absolutely going to come to me for a retake… I did not understand why I thought that. Nevertheless, given that I was considering her appearance as a battle sprite as well, I was able to implement her designs, and I was likewise happy. Hey, speaking of such, for her Third Stage, I had put a parker on her when I was designing her in the beginning. However, because it was plain, I turned it into a kimono. Although, since it was later intended for her chest to be just a little bit bigger, the charm of huge breasts with the nature of cosplay made me put aside the first one… By the way, given that my child is LV 100, has a Lv. 5 Noble Phantasm and MAX Skills, and is being fed all the 4☆ Fou-kuns, she is stronger than the limited teacher[1].
