## Class Skills



**Mad Enhancement: D**

Rank up parameters by 1, but takes away reasons for the most part.

In Bunyan’s case, instead of her reasons, it maddens her foundation existence instead; she is unable to recall whether she is spoken of as a man or woman in the legend.



**Saint Graph Expansion: D**

A Skill falsely similar to “Shapeshift”.

A Skill that enlarges and strengthens her own Saint Graph while keeping her form the same. It includes not only scale up but also scale down.

Bunyan’s size changes depending on the environment.

Within a room with ceilings, she would settle on a size where her head would touch the ceiling as she stoop, but even during movement in which the environment is not constant, her size would change to a compliant size to the place unnoticed. Even if one were to intently looks, it would be like looking at trompe l'oeil, the situation changing before one notices.

Perhaps it is due to that’s how things are in the literature source, but it seems like observation of her size changes circumstances is impossible.

This is a digression, but she knows that through the folkloristic world she is treated as a fake lore, and she really minds a lot about it.

This Skill rank being low is also considered to be one of the reason she has no self-confidence if she isn’t worthy of being Heroic Spirit.

Carelessly touching the subject would make her show a troubled smile with a sad face.

Please don’t.

Also, she completely does not understand the reason of why she is summoned as a woman.



## Personal Skills



**Happy Comrades: A**

Originates from the anecdote where a bunch of abnormal stalwarts gather under Bunyan.

It seems that it is not due to a coincidence that Bunyan’s comrades and the crops he raises up are enormous, but due to Bunyan’s Skill influence.



**Bean Soup Lake: A**

Originates from the anecdote where Bunyan’s camp make bean soup out of the whole lake, enough food for a season.

Bunyan has the ability and the magnanimity to provide for tens of thousands of corps.

As long as you’re with Bunyan, you’d never miss a meal.



**Popcorn Blizzard: B**

Originates from the anecdote where the animals, who misunderstood of the shell of popcorn that Bunyan ate and downpoured from the sky as blizzard, froze to death.

The death from the cold even though it’s not like snow was actually falling, was perhaps due to an unconscious mind attack, or perhaps through the warping of reality by means of Bunyan’s skill.



## Noble Phantasm(s)



# Marvelous Exploits: Exploits to be Astounded for



* Rank: A
* Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
* Range: 2~30
* Maximum target: 30 unit



Marvelous Exploits.

The concept of United States of America itself as a Noble Phantasm. The history of nation founding is turned into energy which strikes the enemy and mows down everything there.

…..is what she herself said, but in actuality you can’t really see it as anything but a giant leg stepping on the enemy.



Its speed is astounding, even among all Noble Phantasm.

## Personality



She is bright yet not lively, obedient, and has the tendency to restraint her self-assertion.

On an aspect, she is also shy and fears strangers. But should she open her heart, she is able to treat others in a friendly manner.

Meek in the way a child is, she is an owner of a sincere heart. But that does not to say it is pure; it seems that she has another aspect going on with her, a strong-willed and determined one.

(She is able to speak of lies, poke fun on others, as well as speak in an unkind manner, as much as anybody else)



Although she likes humans, and is always wishing to communicate with others, she has an introvert mindset and it is quite hard for her to speak for herself.

She is unable to enter herself to an exciting conversation and the likes.

The causes for her mindset being introvert are her insecurity against others and the lack of confidence on herself.

Perhaps it is due to that while on one hand she possesses a large confidence in regards of the character spec and capabilities of Paul Bunyan, to begin with she felt the uneasiness of feeling unworthy as a Heroic Spirit.



She does not hate the gigantic body given to her by her parents; however, she is afraid that it would trouble others and make herself treated like a nuisance.

(She worries that it becomes an environmental burden, both space wise and cost wise)



Which results in her thinking that she would become a hindrance in anything she concern herself with.

She thinks that it is important to verify her own usefulness so that she can be accepted by others; she is very much delighted if given role for things such as manual labor.

(While Bunyan likens herself to a heavy machinery or a large scale wheeled vehicle, that was because she wishes to express that she is useful.)



Such a delicate person, one who thinks of usefulness as the most important thing in the world, would have a simplistic way of thinking that approves of pragmatically eliminates those without use or those which serves as obstacles.

(Like thinking that if all trees on the earth is felled, than mankind would have more space to inhabit, lumbering would increase, and everybody would be happy.)

That is due to her young experience of life, and should she study of the complexity of the world than she would probably revise her thinking.

(She does have the Mad Enhancement skill, so she probably wouldn’t.)



<>



Bunyan, who reclamates the untouched lands for the sake of the happiness of the people.

She has completely no hesitation in the destruction of nature, and to add, she also does not feel any joy in destruction.

Bunyan implements destruction as a duty dispassionately; on the contrary, she actually feels joy in the act of creation.

Her fingers are unusually dexterous, and she got a good head on her shoulders, so she is able to create many things.

She proudly speaks of how it would be a waste to not make use of raw materials such as lumbers and animals meat and skin procured from lumbering and hunting, and so everything must be effectively utilized.

During battle, she would also sharply collected raw materials dropped by enemies.



Babe the Blue Ox which she always brings with her is a mysterious existence, perhaps even one of her Noble Phantasm.

It seems that while Bunyan is fond of Babe, presently she think of it as less of a partner and more of a pet, or perhaps an able livestock.

(Were she in the adult form of her heyday, she would probably feel more sense of friendship….)

It seems that she puts the standard of the merit and demerit in terms of usefulness even on animals, so the way she treat them is quite indifferent. She has no hesitation in hunting.

Even seeing a cute, small one would rarely mellow her.



She is frank towards those equal to her, but towards those above her, those of dignity, she would shrink back and uses polite language.

She speaks unreserved towards the Master because she thinks of them like a family.

She normally uses gentle expressions, but she would also uses rough words when angered.

There is a theory that assumes Quebec woodcutters as her origin; perhaps due to that, she sometimes uses French vocabularies (only simple ones).

She also calls Babe French style, Bebe.



Her magic energy consumption rate is bad. The Master needs to prepare a large quantity of magic energy to compensate for that.

Due to a fear of being constantly hungry, Bunyan really eats her food well.

(Of course, it adds to her magic energy for just a little bit.)

She is sensitive to heat due to her high heat generation and cold region origin.

Because she is young, she doesn’t really feel shy in dressing lightly.



## Attitude Towards Master



She is always thinking of someone’s usefulness.



She really idolizes the Master. What she feels are affection and admiration towards a cool, relative big brother / sister. While she is aware that this is an unrestrained relationship, she still holds herself back and is unable to give her own opinion.

Fundamentally, she obediently performs her order as duty. She would also endure and perform orders that she is unwilling to do.

She rarely takes selfish action out of her own will. (She rarely do selfish things from yielding to her desires such as appetites.)



## Dialogue Examples



“Ashante. I’m Paul Bunyan. Berserker. Nice to meet you.”



“I think I’m really, really useful, you know? You can expect a lot from me. No need to hold back, just tell me anything.”



“Ah, I’ll do it. Leave it to me.”



“If I’m a bother, please tell me, okay?”



“Is it really alright if I’m here….”



“Isn’t this place a bit warm...?”



“Wooow…. amaziiiing (deadpan)”



“C'est la vie... (resignated)”



“Ah! …..I’m hungry.”



“Udon….? What’s wrong with udon? I was made from udon…? What are you saying? Are you alright?”



“This is not really hard, you know. Anybody could’ve made it if they have a workdesk and the recipe.”



“If you’re there, I can’t do reclamation…. You’re in the way.”



“I’ll pulverize you all and use you as land fertilizer (angry)”



“Fuhehe… I squashed it again.”



## Historical Character and Figure



Paul Bunyan was born in America during the age of reclamation.

It seemed that during birth, Paul’s weight was around 36kg.

Paul grew in a blink of an eye, becoming so big that he protruded out from the cattle barn.

Made from the sail of a ship was his cloth, a ship floating in the sea was his cradle, and the guns of the battleship are what woke him up.



He attended school as he grew up. (Naturally, he couldn’t enter the school building)

He had a good head on his shoulders, immediately completing all courses.

The story also goes of how he immediately became an expert in fishing and hunting as well.



Bunyan’s favorite dish is pancake. With an iron plate so big you can’t even see it all if it’s besides you, he would lay oil so much that people can strap bacon on their shoesole and skate on it to bake a pancake for himself.



For Paul Bunyan, his hometown was just too narrow; and so he decided to set off on a journey.



One day during winter where the blue snow had piled so, he found a gigantic, blue baby ox freezing.

He cordially took care of the sick ox and called it Babe, and then it became Bunyan’s companion.



Bunyan continued on his journey while mowing down the trees on the forest, and he realized that the calling of his life was to be a lumberjack.

It is said that the trees that Bunyan had cut down in large quantity flowed down through the river, and in the blink of an eye his business prospered.



Afterwards, there were many stories about Bunyan.



Like how he made bean soup out of a whole lake so that the beans that got thrown carelessly to the lake weren’t wasted;

Like how he freezed and pulled out the evil lake that got in the way of lumber transportation;

Like how the water that he moved using a gigantic bucket was overturned, and he immediately dug a giant ditch on the spot that became flooded and managed to avoid any accident (the ditch became the River of Mississippi, while both sides of the river became the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains);



Like how for the sake of accepting many immigrants he embarked to North Dakota with a large force and thoroughly shaved down a large dense forest (it seemed that at the time, on the excessively gigantic camping grounds it took one day to serve food on the dining table from one ends to another);



There had been many of absurd incidents just like those.

Afterwards, nobody knows what happened to Paul Bunyan.

Perhaps even now he still lives in a forest of America.

Since Paul Bunyan entered the 20th century, on the occasion of being made as an advertisement character for commerce, the original legend had been disregarded in favor of aiming to make the people laugh, and it seemed that the story had been substantially exaggerated.

His unprecedented anecdotes the way they are known currently, like his figure of a giant that blew the clouds, seem to be mostly fabrications during the time.

Folklorist such as Dr. Richard Dorson had seemed to criticize it as a groundless, fake of a folklore.



Putting aside whether it is right or wrong, the giant legend of Paul Bunyan had been widely acknowledged.



## Character in FGO



Paul Bunyan made an appearance in the Tall Tale (cock-and-bull-story) during the United States of America’s age of reclamation, spoken of as a giant of a man who blows the cloud.

There are many legends with scale thoughtlessly large that made use of that enormous size, and it is said that many of North America’s geographical characteristic was due to the influence of Bunyan’s deed.

The reason of why Bunyan is summoned as a young woman is unknown.



Like in the legend, she is accompanied by a giant blue ox as her partner, but its appearance is that of a globe-shaped apparition which, no matter how you look at it, you just can’t think of as an ox.

Perhaps it is the fearsome creature rumoured in America age of reclamation, or as called now, UMA.



Bunyan loves the people; she believes that development of civilization is itself the happiness of the people, and so she cultivates undeveloped lands. If it is so that everyone can lead an abundant life, then she would not hesitate to devote herself in destroying the magnificent mother nature.

The young Bunyan had yet to understand how would that play out for mankind in the future.



## Related Characters



**Andersen, Nursery Rhyme**

She is worried in how the authority in folk story would assess of her tale, and if there is any value in it.



**Altera**

She feels fear against the catchphrase of “destroying civilization” as the creator of civilization. However, because she thinks that destruction too is another part of creation, perhaps they are of the same kind… such is the concern she harbors.



**Hessian Lobo**

The rage of an animal persecuted by the hands of humans in front of her eyes seems to make her feel a slight guilt.



## Comment from the Illustrator



Because her current status is a kid inferior to her heyday, I thought of the stage one ascension to feel childlike, with an urban one piece silhouette like that of the well-known Madeline-chan from the picture book, with the details using outdoor spec because it’s cute. The stage two ascension is Bunyan’s general image as it is. The third stage ascension is the hobby of the heroine from “~By Manga”. (Riyo)[1]
