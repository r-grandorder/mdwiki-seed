# Character

## Pronouns

First pronoun: watashi
Second pronoun: anata/masuta/~onichan, ~oneechan
Third pronoun: kare/kanojo

## Personality

Cool and assertive. She gives off the feeling of maturity, but at the basis she is no different from Illya, possessing the sensitivity of a young girl.

## Attitude Towards Master

Unlike Illya who prefers tranquil, normal life, she proactively accepts the mission on Chaldea as a place where she fully brings to live her own ability.
In regards to the Master, she takes to him/her as a big sister/brother, while behaving herself devilishly.


## Dialogue Examples

"Don't get negligent, or I'll end up killing you, okay?"

"You and I are mutual enemies."

"Now then... guess where I am!"

"My, oniichan, are you that interested with your sister's skin?"

"Go to the hospital, won't you?"

"My magic energy is drained. Resupply? Please?"

"Hey... if you're going to kiss me... then hurry up..."

"Again, a magic energy severance... be counting on you."

"Aww, there's no helping it. Then, I suppose protecting you is my duty."

## Depiction

Together with Illya, she is an elementary schooler of Homurahara Academy in year 5, class 1.
In the world of "Magical Girl Prisma⭐Illya" she resides in Fuyuki City. An offshoof of Illya with completely similar appearance.
Although she had once wagered her own existence in a fierce confrontation with Illya, now she has reconciled with her and is now living together with her officially as her cousin.
With her prodigious battle sense, she excels in her intuition and martial skill, fighting by projecting various weapons.
Normally she requires periodical magic energy supply so that she doesn't cease to exist.
In Chaldea every Servant is automatically supplied with magic energy, but it's still yet to satisfy her.

## Character in FGO

She is a reward Servant after completing the collaboration event of "Magical Girl Diary ~Prisma Corps~".
Simultaneously with the return of the protagonist to Chaldea, she is summoned as a Servant. Since then, she truly lively supports the protagonist as the Master. She herself seems to feel that this is an environment with nothing to criticize.

Widely known as the magic energy sommelier vouched with an abundance of experience. The ally of Chaldea women who desire valor and bravery. (Sometimes the predator of them too.)

**Illyasviel von Einzbern**

For her to follow me even coming to Chaldea... Mm, maybe I've said too much. I know the truth, to be perfectly honest. (ok it said ホット but i bet dollars to donuts its a typo and it actually supposed to be ほんと　because otherwise it just doesnt make sense.)

**Kogil**

Somehow or other, he is the same on the inside, right? Is he just teasing around?

**Emiya**

He's kinda opposed to spoiling the meek and docile me, it's kinda vexing... ah, I've thought of something good⭐

**Emiya (Assassin)**

One of the possibilities of my Papa, huh. There are some areas where I and Illya also overlap with, so I can symphatize.

**Irisviel**

Is Mama an airhead, simple of mind, or all knowing instead? She's really hard to understand, but... mm, yeah, in the end I know she is totally one-of-a-kind.

## Comment from the Illustrator

Being a welfare character, she only has 1 clothing set and it's decided to be her usual piece without any debate. Were she to have 3 stages appearance instead, she would have a bikini armor with armor parts jutting here and there on it. Too bad, so sad. Since, the same with Illya, her design is from the old days, even I am kinda forgetful about it, but the foundation is Emiya's arrangement. Her dark skin is also Emiya's influence. Her breastplate is cut in the image of heart shape. (Hiroyama Hiroshi)
