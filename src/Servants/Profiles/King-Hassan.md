Even if targeted by High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals, it is difficult for them to be wounded.



**Presence Concealment: [A]**

A skill to erase one's presence. The vestiges of what he once learned.

As he carries a strong curse, even if this swordsman obtains a perfect success in his stealth check, his existence ends up being perceived by the “opponent he is about to kill".

In short, the opponent breaks out in cold sweat, perceiving a premonition of the death that is to be their fate.



**Independent Action: [B]**

Originally, an Archer-class specific skill.

This swordsman, who attained a faith pure to the extent of shaving off his meat and scraping out his internal organs, is capable of acting at his own discretion by pure will alone.



**At The Boundary: [A]**

The sword of this individual who continues to walk within the boundary of the Valley, is said to add an instant death effect to every attack.

Although the probability is low, it presents a danger of dying instantly, no matter how formidable the enemy might be.

Those in the Valley are familiar with Death and are one with it, acquiring a resistance to instant death and fear.

When taking the form of a Servant, the rank is lowered to A since he is leaving the boundary by himself.

Instant death immunity, charm immunity and the addition of instant death effect to normal attacks.

## Personal Skills

**Battle Continuation [EX]**

The ability to resume combat.

Allows for survival unless dealt a decisively fatal blow, continuing to fight even when sustaining a wound that leaves one on the verge of death.

This swordsman who is no longer certain whether he is alive or dead, even if he receives a fatal wound or loses half of his body for example, will keep snapping at the enemy as if he was in perfectly good health.



**Natural Body: [A->C]**

The possession of a perfect body as a living being since birth.

It is possible to increase the rank of the parameter of one's physical strength.

A muscular shape even without training, what's more, the body shape won't change no matter how much calorie is ingested...is how it was supposed to be, however, this swordsman has ended up remodelling his body, influenced by his own religious faith. Therefore, the rank is substantial​ly lowered.



**Protection of the Faith: [A+++]**

A Skill possessed only by those who have sacrificed themselves for a religious view.

Despite being a called divine protection, it is not a blessing from a higher existence.[1]

It is nothing but the absoluteness of one’s body and mind that was born from their beliefs. ....If it is too high, it causes abnormalities in the personality.



**Uncrowned Martial Arts: [-]**

Skill with arms that was not recognized due to various reasons.

The rank of his sword, spear, bow, Riding and Divinity-related skills is one rank lower each and the attributes are displayed as the exact opposite of what they are.

In the occasion that his True Name is revealed, this skill is terminated.



**Evening Bell: [EX]**

The evening bell that informs people of funerals and resounds the call of Death.

A unique Skill that manifested as a result of having become one with these rites of passing.

This swordsman does not pick those he kills of his own free will; he brings salvation to those who "lost sight of their moment of death" in place of the Lord of Heaven.

Everything is by the will of Heaven, therefore, those who end up meeting with this swordsman will know of the end of their fate.

―――Can you hear it, the tolling of this bell.

Your luck ends here. Accept the release of your soul. That is your last chance for a peaceful slumber as a human being.

# Character

## Pronouns

* First Person: ware (Also, he uses "The Old Man of the Mountain" as a single "word")
* Second Person:  (Refers to a person by their attribute or the name of the organization they belong to)/omae(This is how he refers to those whose deaths by the hands of "The Old Man of the Mountain" has been decided. Now, this is how he refers to "someone" who's not tied down by the bonds of an organization and who's not a slave to their fate.)
* Third Person: man/woman/person of magecraft(regarding the Master)

## Personality

Due to his fiendish outward appearance​ and fierce manner of fighting, he's pictured with a ruthless nature, but the individual in question is just silent, with a noble disposition that strictly adheres to the Lord's teachings.

Well-versed in both the law of men and the law of God, he perceives "the suspension of life activities" and "the end of life" as different things.

By God's will, the soul is brought salvation at the end of one's life.

As long as they don't go against the teachings, this individual will be the ally of a righteous person. However, since he absolutely won't show any mercy or consideration, he'll spread fear and dread in battle as if he was the Grim Reaper itself.

It is rare for him to say anything, however his intention will be clearly conveyed.

When mad, the (skull's) eyes will shine. When sad, the eyes will shine. Even when pleased, the eyes will shine. No matter what, the eyes will shine.

He holds no interest in the other Heroic Spirits and he does not convey his views, thoughts and desires to others.

However, towards the other Hassans, he becomes a strict Senpai to the point of being relentless.

「Cursed Arm. What didst thou seek to grasp, to the extent of obtaining that devil's arm? Thine own foolishness? Very well, hand over thy head.」

「Hundred Faces. What hast thou accumulated with thy countless knowledge? A desire to contend thy hundred souls for a single truth? How shallow. Now, hand over thy head.」

No matter what you do, your head will be lopped off.

## Attitude Towards Master

A knight of terror (dread knight) who does not display any loyalty, but answers the trust placed in him with his all of his soul.

This swordsman, who once turned all of his faith into a sword, continues to condemn the evil of this world in the name of the Lord.

What is evil?

Those diseased beings who do not concern themselves with the Lord's authority and the righteous actions of man.

He shows no mercy for evil.

For argument's sake, he would cut down even a believer if there was something evil inside them. For God does not perform evil. That is a false believer, in other words, the most wicked evil on this world.

## Dialogue Examples

* 「―――――――――」

* 「Call me as thou pleases. I hadst no name from the beginning. There is no insistence or agreement.」

* 「The setting sun that is rewarded with vanishing in the mountain range upon the battle's conclusion. That is thou.」

* 「Be at ease. Hand over thy head.」

* 「Dost thou hear hear the bell announcing death? Thy overdue disappearance is forgiven. God's will has finally reached thou.」

* 「Mine aspect is the death of the Old Man. Mine sword is the verdict of the Old Man. For the Old Men of the Mountain, I am Old Man of the Mountain. ――――In other words, the Hassan who executes Hassans.」

## Historical Character and Figure

The assassin wearing a skull mask.

Regarded as the first Hassan Sabbah, who was born when the name “Old Man of the Mountain” changed into a title, after the assassination cult became established as assassins.

However, it has been said that neither the other 18 Hassans nor the followers of the cult knew this individual’s true identity and proof of his existence was nowhere to be found.

The legendary assassin said to appear to take the head of a generation’s Hassan-i-Sabbah when they go against the teachings.

In other words, a Hassan who executes Hassans.



Supposedly there was not a single eye-witness within the assassination cult who saw him, which is as it should be - one’s life would be forfeit from the moment they laid eyes on this individual.

He, who was the origin of the “Old Man of the Mountain”, also chose the life of a guardian who convicts the corruption of the religious organization at the same time.

Even if the cult is righteous according to the teachings of God, that does not change the fact that their deeds as human beings are evil. Therefore, this individual could not forgive the cult becoming corrupt.

For those who protect the teachings of God to drown in human cravings.

That, in particular, is the greatest blasphemy against God.

The corruption of the cult is, namely, the degradation of its top, the “Old Man of the Mountain”.

Regardless of whether it is the degradation of the mind or of the skills, the name of “Old Man of the Mountain” is not bestowed upon one who has declined.

Decline is, in other words, death. The severing of one’s head is a pardon for their sins and a hope to be entrusted to the next “Old Man of the Mountain”.

In order to provide a just cause for this failure of a role of assassinating assassins, this individual chose not concealed weapons and assassination tools, but to openly fight with a large sword.

When someone catches sight of this skull, that means the end of that person.

After he has handed down the verdict upon the fool who broke the religious organization’s dogma, those who have seen the figure of the swordsman of the skull disappear from this world. Having buried many assassins, he is said to be concealed in the darkness of the Order of Assassins until the day of its destruction.

The living legends, the abyss of assassins of whom nobody exists as an eye-witness.

Such is this swordsman of the skull.

## Character in FGO

Introduced in Chapter 6 of Part 1, the individual standing at the summit of assassins.

Since he is legend who's dead while alive, he can be summoned in Chaldea if the person himself feels like it; this is the sort of out-of-the-norm Heroic Spirit he is.

Merlin who can not fade away until the extinction of mankind and "The Old Man of the Mountain" who continues to wander the boundary between life and death are both those who travel eternally and because of this it seems like they are somewhat kindred spirits.

Named "King Hassan" in chapter 6 by the Protagonist who does not know much about Magecraft, but with a "I do not mind being called that", he easily accepted it, and from there on, there were many times when he was referred to as that.

In order to return the favour to the Master of Chaldea who broke into the hearts of the mountainfolk, and also broke through the Lion King, throwing away his grand title, he became the sword of the summoner, known as "The Old Man of the Mountain".

This is a bit of a digression, but in the early days of FGO's development, even a special summoning banner was taking into consideration.

It was an idea where, by collecting one hundred Hassans (any kind of Hassans) and fusing them, you could summon him.

『Oh...? The Hassans are...?

A unique SSR Servant that anybody can get if they just persevere, one you can obtain even if you have no luck!

His name is Ki~ng Hassa~n!』

......It was the model example for something interesting that can not be put into practice.


## Related Characters

**Hassans of the successive generations**

As the Founder, he scolds the Old Men who did a poor job. It goes without saying that scolding = death.



**Ereshkigal**

The teachings might be different, but from her belief and obligation towards death he feels something virtuous.

If Chaldea were to be involved with the "Land of Death" once again, if she was also present, there would be no role for him to play, is what he thinks.



**Nitocris**

The teachings are different, but her decorum towards the "deceased", the attitude of a ruler, is something to which he can nod in approval.

If Chaldea were to be involved with the "Land of Death" once again and she was all alone by herself at that time, the burden might be bit too much for her...is the concern[2] he feels for her.



**???** (The name is censored)

"O Smoking Mirror. Killing for the sake of killing. Existing to die. If that is thine faith, I am unable to dispute it."

## Comment from the Illustrator

When it comes to his outward appearance, first was the impression of a "Knight Hassan" so the first draft gave off the feeling a knight in full armor equipped with the mask the other Hassans wear, but he received a revision to strengthen the elements of "Grim Reaper" and "skull", resulting in his current appearance. Anyway, I am delighted that I could cram all the elements I like into him. (Ryota-H)

## Translation Notes:

[1] This line might be a bit confusing since the TYPE-MOON wiki and the FGO wiki translates "信仰の加護" as "Protection of the Faith", but "加護" should be translated as "divine protection".

[2] Gotta love the Japanese word ("老婆心") for "concern" here. It's made up of the kanjis for "old", "old woman/grandma" and "heart/mind".
