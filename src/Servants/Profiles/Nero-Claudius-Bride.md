## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [C]**

Negates magecraft with a chant of two verses or less. It can’t block larger scale magecraft, like High-Thaumaturgy or Cursing Rites.
Since she herself has no innate Magic Resistance whatsoever, she boasts a rank unbefittingly low for the Saber Class.

**Riding: [B]**

Talent for riding. Can ride most mounts better than most people but can't mount beasts on the ranks of demonic beasts or holy beasts.

## Personal Skills

**Stars to the Heavens: [A]** / **Flowers to the Ground: [A]** / **Love to the People: [A]**

Powerful support skills. They grant various buffs to one party member of her choice.
The blessed hymns from the bride who, in the apex of joy, sees the world filled with light.
Using them as support Skills is the correct way to use them, but when Nero Bride is the only one left, she can use all of them into herself alone, ascending these into an absurd set of Cheat Skills. Truly a Super Egotist.



## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Aestus Domus Aurea (Inviting Golden Theater)
- Rank: B+
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 30
- Max. Targets: 1 person
 
Aestus Domus Aurea: Marriage edition.
Titled: Nuptiae Domus Aurea.

The absolute imperial range she uses to achieve her own wishes, but redecorated for a wedding.
The special sword move she uses here is the Fax Caelestis (Star-winning Rose of Finales).
It’s just a sword move, but it’s treated as a Noble Phantasm due to Nero’s own statement: “It’s floridness, it’s beauty and the overwhelming marriageness released from the wedding dress are more than enough for it to be considered a Noble Phantasm, are they not? Hm?”.
It is nicknamed “Confession Sword”. See Fate/EXTRA CCC and/or Fate/EXTELLA to learn why.

# Character

## Pronouns

First person pronoun: you
Second person pronoun: kiden/ kisama/ name with no honorifics
Third person pronoun: kidentachi/ kisamara/ name with no honorifics

## Personality

Pretty much the same as Nero, so we’ll be skipping this part. THIS IS NOT OUT OF LAZINESS!

## Attitude Towards Master

While the normal Nero Claudius represents her life as the “Emperor Nero”, this one represents her life as a “bride”.
She acknowledges and affectionately respects her Master and likes to have them watching over each other as people who walk side by side and keep constantly growing.

## Dialogue Examples

“Aye, I reenter the stage, in new outfit! Call me bride Saber, or Nero Bride!”

“I am glad to be getting stronger, but with this size, my dress won’t last much longer…”

“Why did I change into a wedding dress, you ask? Huhuhu, it is evident. Because! I! so wanted to!”

“Sunrays of spring, dancing of flowers! The winds of May brush against my cheeks, while blessings reach beyond the stella… Open, Nuptiae Domus Aurea!”

## Character in FGO

A guest fighter from Fate/EXTRA CCC.
The emperor of roses in new outfit: a snow-white dress.
The new outfit changes her mood, making her fighting style different from her standard form. Her favorite sword, Aestus Estus, got the memo and changed its blade from red to silvery white.
She was conceptualized in Fate/EXTRA CCC as an extremely niche fetish, with her wedding dress being born from the thematic question of “what would be the most charming restraining tool for a woman?”.
That said, Nero is so fixated in her bride mood that she fails to see any problems with this.

…One alternate possibility.
Her source is Fate/EXTRA CCC but she is not the Nero that appears in CCC.
A snow-white Servant who died before she could ever meet her fated spouse and kept fighting as a Servant without ever finding a soulmate.In other words, this is her form that sunk into dreams without ever taking part in that virtual world’s Holy Grail War.
Her Bond 5 My Room line as a top contender for the most powerful among all Servants.

**Tamamo-no-Mae**

“This new Fox Wedding Skill is far too clever. What gives?”

**Altera**

“I’m somewhat interested… I mean, look at that brown skin and that unexcessive buxom… Fine, very fine! Even as an enemy, I’m find myself charmed by her!”

**Emiya**

“Emiya? Not Nameless? What are you, a bat!? (1)”

## Comment from the Illustrator

I was the regular Nero for references and felt like I drew her face too stern, so for Bride I had my thoughts of “I want her to feel swee~eeet♥” diluted in my consciousness. I think I did the outfit variation well. I made it very gaudy and that’s great~!The Slime tits (2) and the butt in the final picture were both by my own input. (Wada Arco)

**TL Notes**

1. Aesop's fable of the cowardly bat. The birds and the beasts were at war. A cunning bat observed this and whenever the beasts were winning, he would appear to the beasts and say "I'm covered in fur, so I'm on the beasts' side". Whenever the birds were winning, he would appear to the birds and say "I have wings, so I'm on the birds' side".The war ended on a peaceful settlement, but the bat ended up hated and rejected by both the beasts and the birds because he was a two-faced opportunist who keep double-crossing both sides all the time. Since he was rejected by everyone everywhere, he began to hide himself in the caves and only fly at night.Nero is calling FGO's Emiya an opportunist for being both FSN's Emiya and FE's Nameless whenever it's convenient.

2. Not slimy tits, but tits shaped like the Slimes from Dragon Quest.
