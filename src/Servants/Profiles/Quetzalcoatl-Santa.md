## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [A+]**

Her already powerful magic resistance has become even stronger after having turned into a Ruler.

Unlike the one possessed by the Saint-type Rulers, hers is more based around 'taking it and enduring it'. Even if its damage that could be avoided, she will still take it head on.

**Goddess' Essence: [A]**

A skill symbolizing how she's been a fully realized goddess since birth.

A skill that sustains the absolute nature of her mind and body. It blocks out any mental interference and halts her body's growth, so no matter how many calories she consumes, her body will not change.

It is a composite skill that includes the Divinity skill.

Due to having been embedded with such a foreign concept like that of Santa, its rank has degraded compared to when she's a Rider.

## Personal Skills

**Sambista: [B]**

One who loves Samba.

Her life of samba had all begun from a slight misunderstanding, but since she thought that if she was gonna do it she had to do it correctly, she ended up studying about it deeply, and of course being the human-lover that she is, she ended up thinking samba was truly wonderful.

Now she's come to love the culture of samba created by humans in the middle of their growth.

The problem is that she had nobody around who knew of the correct way to do samba, so at the end of her training she ended up acquiring a style of samba that might be a little different from the usual...but she doesn't really mind.

After all, the most important thing is to have fun, right?

**Gift from the Goddess: [A]**

A variation of Saint's Gift and Starman's Gift.

Even after becoming a Santa, the fact that she's a goddess still remains.

**Christmas Assault: [EX]**

Quetzalcoatl is a luchadora at heart.

However she's now also a Santa.

In order to erase the paradox created by her nature she created this skill that allows her to maintain her movements as befitting of a Santa while she also fights in the ring. Therefore, these are not aerial assault anymore but rather 'Christmas Assault'.

Her style of fighting is now not one that specializes in aerial fighting but rather one that specializes is fighting around the very concept of Christmas.

They say that when Santa Claus flies in the air you can hear a holy bell counting three times in the jungle of the ring's mat.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Yucatán Regalo de Navidad - Delivering Love to Children on the Holy Night
- Rank: A
- Type: Anti-Unit
- Range: 50
- Maximum Targets: 100

Yucatán Regalo de Navidad.

"What's that!?" "It's a star!" "It's a space colony!"

"No, it's a Christmas present!"

A move created by Santa Quetzalcoatl where she delivers a present with all of her power.

'Regalo de Navidad' is the literal translation to Spanish of 'Christmas present'.

This NP is also known as The Yucatán-style Present Slam.

Due to Quetzalcoatl having let herself go in the middle of Samba's liberating rhythm, the present that gets released turns out to be one of enormous size. Its impact is said to be similar to that of the giant meteor that crashed in the Yucatan peninsula, which is also said to be the origin of her as a deity. Of course, her present isn't filled with whatever it was that exterminated the dinosaurs, but it is filled with whatever makes children happy.

Even if she where to unleash it upon a bad guy in the ring, it would still only make the children watching their match happy, and thus, this Noble Phantasm exists solely to bring smiles to children.

# Character

## Personality

She's not any different from the usual Quetzalcoatl.

However, whenever some trouble happens she seems to always try and solve it with the rhythm of samba or her Santa moves. I mean, while she went through the trouble of becoming Santa.

What if that doesn't work?

Then it's time for lucha.

## Attitude Towards Master

She doesn't have a wish for the grail.

Actually, she managed to become a Santa due to the power of the christmas grail, so she's satisfied with just that.

In this holy festival she relies on her Master as her manager, or as her corner man.

Her Master already has so much to do that she doesn't expect them to act as a reindeer (she uses her Quetzalcoatlus for this). However if they still feel like helping, she will gladly take them along to deliver presents.

## Dialogue Examples

"I'll give you a finishing hold as a present!"

"I got a bit confused, but isn't it fun to deliver presents while dancing samba? A samba Santa, there is nothing more wonderful than this. Leave it to me Master! I'll do my best to bring back our proper christmas!"

"Christmas, lucha and samba were all things created by humans. That's why I love them all so much!"

## Character in FGO

Quetzalcoatl had suddenly been chosen as the next Santa by her predecessor, Altera the San(Ta).

She simply took the power of the Christmas grail and gladly became a santa, but then three problems occurred.

1-Quetzalcoatl had mixed up Santa and Samba.

2-Due to having taken in a concept foreign to her american divinity such as Santa Claus, two aspects of herself became divided, 'the kind goddess Quetzalcoatl' and 'the fighting goddess Quetzalcoatl'.

3-Due to the shock of having been divided, the evil Quetzalcoatl 'Black Quetzal' stole the grail and flew to Mexico.

Quetzalcoatl was too caught up in her duties as Santa at the time so she reassured everyone that there was no need to worry. But of course, there was.

In no time, Quetzalcoatl received a report that Mexico had turned into a singularity.

When she arrived, she saw the strange sight of a Mexican city filled with snow.

There was also a mysterious event, the Santa Tag Tournament, where the winning team would be given the power to become a true santa.

## Her role in the game:

She appeared in Christmas 2018 Holy Samba Night.

She enters the tag tournament in order to defeat Black Quetzal, teaming up with the female knight she met as her tag partner, and brings along her Master as her manager and corner man.

## Standard Weapons

Christmas Assault.

## Related Characters

**Santa Servants:**

"I'm so happy I always get new companions every year!

Now all together, let's make the children of the world happy!"

**Bradamante:**

Her trusted tag partner. She wants to fight together with her if they ever get the chance.

She already has a mask prepared for her.

**Mata Hari:**

A wonderful dancer she wants to have join her samba team.

She already has a samba outfit prepared for her.

**Mysterious Alter Ego Λ:**

"Oh I know, you're a dancer too, right?

Huh? You only dance on ice?

...A deathmatch on top of an ice ring? That's what you mean right? Ok, I'll take you on!"

**Astraea:**

A new worthy opponent who appeared suddenly like a comet.

"Her wrestling or my lucha libre, I really want us to test out which is best!"

However, as she's looking forward to it way too much, she's still avoiding facing her off officially on top a ring.

Whenever they happen to meet when walking down the halls, they stare at each other keeping their distance and walk to their sides while drawing a circle, each of them waiting for the other to make a move.

If one were to sound a bell at that moment, there's no doubt that the two would launch themselves at the other.

## Comment from the Illustrator

"The word 'samba santa' exuded so much power that it took a while until my mind could really process it. I did what I could and designed her, but the fact I couldn't do much more than add christmas tree motifs to a simple samba outfit is a result of my own lack of power as an artist. I really need to get better at character design...I also tried to give her a fit body due to her being a lucha master, but she ended up looking more like a competitive swimmer. I'm sorry. I'll do better next time so please let me draw Quetzalcoatl again." (Hiroe Rei)
