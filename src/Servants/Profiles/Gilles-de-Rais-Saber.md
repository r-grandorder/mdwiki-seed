## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [B]**

Invalidates magecraft with an activation chant below three verses.

Even being wounded by High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals is difficult.

**Riding: [B]**

Talent for riding. Can ride normal vehicles with above average skill, but can’t ride beasts on the level of Demonic Beast or Divine Beast.

**Mad Enhancement: [EX]**

Since it’s a very special summoning, and the name of Gilles de Rais is much more famously known as ――― Bluebeard, even Saber will be granted the Mad Enhancement skill.

## Personal Skills

**Military Tactics: [C]**

Tactical intuition in a battlefield in which a large number of people is mobilized, not for one versus one battles.

As Jeanne Darc’s assistant, he obtained several military merits.

In the case of being under an attack similar to a siege battle, a bonus is particularly added.

**Golden Rule: [B]**

Predestination of how much money went around in life.

Having an enormous territory and heritage, he shouldn’t have had any problem with money during his life, but……

**Prelati’s Encouragement: [A]**

Encouragement coming from Prelati. From where? Nobody knows.

It’s Strength reinforcement through magecraft, but as a compensation, the memories from after Jeanne’s death become clearer.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Saint War Order - Rally upon the Sacred Banner and Roar

- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm (Self)
- Range: 1
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person

Saint War Order.

A Noble Phantasm that reproduces the moments when he was fighting under the flag of the saint Jeanne, in other words, the moment at which he was shining the most.

Together with a status up effect similar to Mad Enhancement, performs attacks automatically until the targeted enemy has been completely silenced. A bonus is added to the damage from attacks.

# Prelati’s Spellbook - Textbook of the Spiral Sunken Castle

- Rank: C
- Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum number of targets: 100 people

Prelati’s Spellbook.

A grimoire wrapped with human skin. Allows to summon and exploit a kind of water demons from the deep sea.

This book itself has a function as a mana furnace, and allows to perform spells on the level of High Thaumaturgy/Greater Rituals independently of the caster’s mana.

…… But, the Gilles de Rais that is a Saber doesn’t use this Noble Phantasm even if he brings it with him.

Should he use it, he will automatically change his class to Caster, and 『Rally upon the sacred banner and roar』 will be sealed. (Not used in 『FateGO』).

Sincerely, he serves with earnestness. He who is an excellent warrior, will give accurate advice.

「After winning, counting the number of victims left behind is a vain thing.」

「Which is the right way…… for me to go……? No…… Master…… I dedicate my sword to you…… It’s just that…… Just that……」

「About the saint? Yes, I don’t have any problem with talking, but…… Do you have at least three hours to spare?」


## Historical Character and Figure

A curiosity-seeking murderer that tortured very young children to death.

That’s the valuation of Gilles de Rais nowadays. However, her wasn’t such a being from the beginning.

He was a nobleman with a vast territory at the western region of France, and lived his life indulging in every possible luxury.

Had things stayed like this, he’d have disappeared without being known by history as a libertine nobleman that didn’t know the ways of the world.

A turning point will come to him.

The Hundred Years War ――― A war between France and England that had been unfolded across a long period of time. In the side of France, which was being gradually cornered, one saint appeared.

Jeanne Darc.

The Gilles de Rais that met her had accomplished several accomplishments in the Hundred Years War. It could be said that the coronation at Reims was truly the peak period for him.

But when Jeanne Darc was sentenced to burning at the stake, everything went mad.

Suffering, he returned again to his luxurious life, but his heart was already filled with emptiness.

And as he began to perform mysterious rituals like alchemy or black arts, he awakened the cruel disposition inherited from his grandfather.

The shape of the once virtuous knight Gilles de Rais couldn’t be seen anywhere.

What was there was a murderer that had fallen into darkness.

And the judgment from God he believed that would someday come didn’t ――


## Related Characters

**Jeanne d'Arc**

The girl I used to line up with. I don’t regret having pledged everything for the girl, even my life, even my status.

**Jeanne d'Arc (Alter)**

A once saint that has fallen to blackness. Even so, if she said 「follow me」. I would gladly serve as her entourage to the ends of Hell.

**Gilles de Rais (Caster)**

I wonder what about those clothes. But looking well…… Not bad…… Hoho……

## Comment from the Illustrator

Since it was established that he’d have the grimoire, the semi-fallen estate of the third stage was the initial design. There, I received a suggestion from Takeuchi-san, a beautiful Gilles (1 – 2 stage) was born, and a story nature was given to the Ascensions. The fall to darkness of the heroine is erotic and nice.
