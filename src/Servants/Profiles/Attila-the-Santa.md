## Class Skills



**Magic Resistance: [C]**



Invalidates magecraft with an aria of three verses or lower.

Even if it’s a High-Thaumaturgy · Greater Ritual, she barely receives any damage. [2]

Since she sometimes can’t refute any claim of 『It’s different from the present I wished』 due to her natural kindness, her resistance to magical energy is lower than when she was a Saber.



**Riding: [EX]**



Chosen as a Heroic Spirit of Christmas, and engulfed by the quiet flames of a sense of duty, Altera has greatly improved · transformed her Riding skill.

Concretely, she has become a sheep master.

The figure running not on a famous horse, but on the famous sheep Zerco, is associated with that of the strongest king of the nomadic and equestrian tribe of the Huns who ran about the Western world… is it… associated?



**Civilization Erosion: [EX]**



A skill that is unconsciously activated by the Heroic Spirit Altera.

It transmutes whatever she has in her hand into the best attributes for her current self.

『The best』 doesn’t mean 『the most excellent』, but refers to the current obsession of Altera herself. It’s not necessary to say what Altera’s current obsession this time is.

Originally, the horses that should have been taken along as horses have all turned into sheep (kind of), and conversely her beloved sword Sword of the War God has been modified into the Cane (staff) of the War God. Amazing.



**Divinity: [B]**



Existence of aptitude as a Divine Spirit.

Altera herself has no biological relationship with a Divine Spirit, but the fact of she trampling the European World was considered God’s authority, and being subject of awe resulted in her obtaining the two names of 『Punishment of God』 『Whip of God』. From those things, Altera, who became a Heroic Spirit on earth, possesses a high rank of Divine Spirit aptitude.





## Personal Skills



**Gift of the Starman: [B]**



A skill acquired after becoming Santa Claus.

Giving presents, enriching the heart.

Although Altera wants to give presents, she can’t quite grasp the desire of others, and also because of her reserved personality, the skill rank is lower than Santa Alter (Artoria).

Santa Alter has 『Gift of the Saint』, but in Altera’s case, it’s changed for some reason to 『Gift of the Starman』.



**Natural Body: [D]**



Having become a Heroic Spirit of Christmas, since she can’t regulate her body temperature properly due to having the concept of winter added, it has unfortunately been lost.

(Not used in 『FateGO』)



**Sugar Sculpture of Rainbow: [B]**



The star attached to the Christmas tree’s top is called the Star of Bethlehem, and symbolizes the birth of the Messiah.

It is said that those struck by Altera Santa’s cane with a clunk will be given great blessings and favors. A minimum version of Merlin’s 『Hero Creation』. It’s Christmas, this much of a cheat is allowed!



**Crest of the Twinkling Star: [EX]**



A skill that has changed due to the fusion of the unique patterns carved on Altera’s body and the concept of Christmas.

Through this strong blessing power, Altera-san awakens the potential engraved on her Saint Graph, and can act as Altera Santa for just three minutes on Earth!

A super power-up for 3 turns. After 3 turns, stun.



## Noble Phantasm(s)



# Candy Star Photon Ray: Rainbow of Christmas Eve, Sword of the War God



- Rank: EX
- Type: Anti-World Noble Phantasm
- Range: 30~300
- Maximum number of targets: 1000 people



Candy Star Photon Ray.

A new Noble Phantasm devised by having transformed the Sword of the War God that Altera has into a candy cane.

Photon Ray is now Photon Ram.

Please enjoy the splendid Itano Circus by Altera’s subordinate sheep.[3]

In secret, it’s viewed as the rival to Caster of Okeanos’ Noble Phantasm · Pig Great Parade, but that’s for another episode.



Far away from the stone chamber.

Without connecting memories or records,

even if that huge solitude is still not healed.

The sheep she sees in her dreams span the night sky as a rainbow.

## Pronouns



- First person pronoun: 私 (watashi)
- Second person pronoun: おまえ (omae) / 〇〇 (without honorifics)
- Third person pronoun: 奴 (yatsu) / 彼奴 (aitsu) / 〇〇 (without honorifics)



## Personality



In order to infer whether Christmas, in which presents are given, is a good civilization or a bad civilization, she assumed the role of Santa Claus.

Saint Graph-wise she’s Altera, but since she has a slight fever, her judgment is weaker than usual, and it’s become easier to give her instructions.

One wonders if it’s fine to say the prettiness · loveliness of her appearance has increased.

Due to (thanks to) the fever, her Destroy-Civilization-Meter has been remarkably lowered.

The usual Altera is 90% character as a warrior, and 10% character as a girl,

but Altera Santa has become 40% character as a warrior, and 60% character as a girl.

Altera’s base is girlish and romantic, so she’s happy and excited about being entrusted the role of Santa Claus.





## Attitude Towards Master



She sees Master as a reliable partner or a beautiful sheep, and calls them 『Fluffy Master』.

She tells herself that she’s Santa Claus before Altera, so her demeanor · responses are softer than usual.

That, combined with Altera’s honor student character of『doing things with all her power』, resulted into a strange behavior.

How much she knows and how much she doesn’t know can’t be grasped, but in order to make Christmas succeed, and to deliver an 『important gift』 from a shining sheep, she straightforwardly relies on the Master.

Her special technique is an imitation of Elder Santa Claus.

※ Elder Santa Claus is a lifeform from Altera’s imagination.



## Dialogue Examples



「I’m Altera. The great warrior and king of the Huns.

… As you can see, I am Santa. I’m Santa」



「Wait, now I’ll become a perfect Santa」

Here she puts on a false mustache with a rustling,

「Hohoho. I’m Santa」



「There’s only one problem. That this outfit is a bit cold.

It’s not a change from the usual? That shouldn’t be… It’s a bit cold」



「I know. It’d be fine to distribute presents, wouldn’t it?

But there is only one day. What a problem. Can one person distribute presents to children all over the world…?」



「――― I understand. Christmas is a warm civilization」



## Historical Character and Figure



The Western great king that built a great empire. A person from the 5th century.

Attila the Hun.

Descendant of the Xiongnu (Huns)[4], a warrior and king of the Hun tribe.

A great hero that, leading equestrian troops and trampling all over the battlefield, made of a vast territory reaching from Western Asia to Russia, Eastern Europe, and even Gaul, her own empire through countless deaths and victories



## Character in FGO



Look to the skies.

If you’re one to pray to the night sky you should see it.

The lonely rainbow dashing through the night sky.

The flock of sheep crying meeh, meeh.

And with her body wrapped in daring garments,

with a little feeling of having a cold, the figure of a beautiful Santa…!

Her name is Altera the San(ta).

The great king of the West, the sword princess possessing the Crest of the Star has awakened from an eventful fate

with a duty and motivation as Santa Claus.

This time she’s accompanied by many nomad and equestrian soldiers from her anecdote as a great king. …Though, they all have become lovely sheep (although in a spacial way). Why is that.



♢



Her too healthy body and her too sound mind, as well as her a bit ignorant… Nay, innocent character gave her a unique opportunity.

When the Chaldea staff fell victim to a mysterious fever, Altera the Santa, as the only 『Servant able to move』, got on the back of the famous sheep Zerco and flew away for the sake of peace in Chaldea and Christmas.

For Altera, who wanted to ascertain the civilization of Christmas for a long time, this role was what she wanted. Changing into showy Santa clothes, she dove into the sky of the Underworld.

Her only insecurity is the chill of the Santa clothes.

「Compared to the usual clothes, the area isn’t that small…?」, Altera Santa tilts her head.

## Comment from the Illustrator



The rough sketch I drew when I said 「I’ll do it」 after being requested to do Altera the San(ta) went along easily so I worked happily with that pace. The scenario is the best and Ere-chan is so cute this has naturally entered my TOP3 of works I’m glad to have done! Thank you very much! (huke)



## TL Notes



[1]: But she was from 2017…

[2]: Why not ranking it up to B then?

[3]: This.

[4]: It’s written as フンヌ and ヒュンヌ between brackets, but there’s no alternative writing for “Hun” in English as far as I know. Also, Xiongnu aren’t exactly the same as Huns, but they’re associated with them.

[5]: Obvious reference to Padoru memes.

[6]: Just in case, she means Dumuzid. The ジ of ドゥムジ can be read as either “ji” (similar to G) or “zi”.
