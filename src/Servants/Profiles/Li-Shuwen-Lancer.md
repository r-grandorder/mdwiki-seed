## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [D]**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done in one step (a Single Action). A Magical Resistance of the same degree as an amulet that rejects Magical Energy.

## Personal Skills

**Chinese Martial Arts (Liuhe Da Qiang [Six Harmony Big Spear]): [A+++]**

A Chinese rationality. A value that measures how much mastery of the martial arts one has for the objective of becoming one with the universe. Its learning difficulty is of the highest level, and different from other Skills, it is at the Rank of A that one has reached the level where it is possible to say that they have finally “learned it”.

Since it is at +++, Li Shuwen is a master among masters.

Although summoned as a Lancer, Li Shuwen has mastered Bajiquan, including its spearmanship.

**Sphere Boundary: [B]**

A technique that uses Qi to perceive the state of affairs in the environment around oneself, while also, having their own existence disappear. By mastering this to achieve a state of oneness with the universe, it becomes possible to even have one’s figure become naturally transparent.

Due to being summoned as a Lancer this time, Li Shuwen’s usage of Sphere Boundary has not reached a complete Presence Concealment like before.

**Juezhao: [B]**

The secrets of Bajiquan that Li Shuwen had learned. With regards to Anti-Personnel abilities, this is certainly said to be the ultimate one among them.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Shen Qiang – Wu Er Da (The God Spear – No Second Strike)
- Rank: —
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 2~5
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

A technical skill that reached up to the point of sublimation as a Noble Phantasm, similarly to “No Second Strike” or “Tsubame Gaeshi”. Its effects are the same as “No Second Strike” during his time of being summoned as an Assassin, but its range has been extended in proportion to the spear he holds. From the anecdote of him having “pierced the flies perched on the wall without scratching the wall”, one can guess that his precise movements are also not very different from when he fights bare-handed.

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronoun: washi
Second Person Pronoun: onushi
Third Person Pronoun: ayatsu

## Personality

To put him in a few words, a blade that cuts sharply upon being touched. Li Shuwen has regained his youth; therefore, he is equipped with a condition where his rough nature is laid bare in the open. On the topic of one having attained their youth to some extent after becoming, more or less, heroes, there are many people who will have that sort of breezy feeling of feeling young again, but for Li Shuwen in particular, that nature is stronger within him.

At the time of having grown old, he was intimate with children as the “grandpa who taught them boxing”, but Li Shuwen as he is now swings his Evil Fist on his own accord, devoting everything he has to fight a formidable and tough enemy, as well as to being a martial artist with even some austere sense.

## Attitude Towards Master

Towards his Master, Li Shuwen basically treats them as a superior or an equal.

And, no matter what sort of unjust tactic it is, if it is “for the sake of fighting with a formidable enemy”, Li Shuwen will maintain a degree of generosity and close his eyes for his victims. As one would expect, he does not have a behaviour of attacking the weak on purpose, but he would especially not hesitate to attack them if he understands that it is necessary to do so. He does not kill without reason, but if there is some reason to kill, then one can conclude that he has no problem doing so.

Regarding the Holy Grail, Li Shuwen has no particular wish… but, if the opportunity of making a wish does come true, he is secretly intending on “Something like fighting against my aged self.”

## Dialogue Examples

“Even if I say so myself, it seems brutal to attain enlightenment with this body. I do not feel at ease.”

“If one has regained their youth, then have a desire in dedicating everything to martial arts; if one has completely grown old, then become eager in acquiring enlightenment to cross over death. Whichever one it is, the fact is that both are me. Although, you will understand someday what I just mentioned.”

“————Let us… have a fair… match!!”"

## Historical Character and Figure

Li Shuwen, originating from Cangzhou, Hebei, is a legendary martial artist who possessed so much talent, he was extolled to the point of being called “The God Spear” from the closing years of the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China era. Rather than mastering one thousand techniques, he placed an emphasis on polishing up a single technique, and it is said that the techniques he made use of were practically no more than the most basic of basics as well. To that degree, he also left behind a legend where his polished blows are so intense, his opponent died just from being given a feint. His Noble Phantasm has also been given another name, “A Second Strike is Needless”, and this is something that sublimated the episode of that time.

In his later years, although Li Shuwen displayed a side as a good-natured old man who taught boxing to the neighbouring children, around the time of his youth – like the occasion of him being summoned as he is now – he was at that moment the Demon Fist Master who wields his Evil Fist. The reason he shouts “seven wounds of gushing blood” at the time of being summoned as an Assassin in “Fate/EXTRA” was because of an anecdote where his opponent who received his blow had stopped breathing while spouting blood from both his eyes, mouth, nostrils and ears.

Furthermore, Servants in the Holy Grail War are fundamentally summoned in their golden age form, but limited to Li Shuwen, he can be exceptionally summoned in his elderly form. This is none other than because this single human being has entered his golden age twice with two different forms. It is a difference whether he is in his golden age with only his skill with the fist – wielding them to the utmost limit to achieve a state of oneness with the universe – or whether he is in his golden age during his season of old age where he possesses a fighting spirit that engulfs all his enemies. His youthful season where he exerts his wild fists, and his aged self where he exerts his rational fists that had arrived at a domain said to be beautiful. The directions of their strengths are different. This peculiarity is rarely seen by other Servants, and in a normal Holy Grail War as well, it is possible for even a showdown to occur between the same person summoned in different Classes.

## Related Characters

**Scáthach**

What resulted of the last bout in the Fifth Chapter? It is not clear because of the Human Order Correction.

**Wong Fei-hung**

In the history of Chinese martial arts, this person is the master standing at the highest peak. Imagining about that special move which leaves not even a shadow behind, Li Shuwen wonders how closely it can reach him, so he will not calm down unless he kills that hero, even if he is only dreaming of such a moment.

## Comment from the Illustrator

Braids! CHEERS FOR BRAIDS!!!! HOORAY!
The background of Li Shuwen’s last picture is based off a photograph taken at Yokohama Chinatown. Since I wanted to draw a nightlife Shuwen standing at a dazzling spot that resembles Chinatown and Kabukicho, his Third Stage outfit was determined through a reverse lookup of the image from his last picture.
