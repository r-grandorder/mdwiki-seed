## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [B]**

Invalidate magic invocation with chant 3 verses or less.

It is hard to damage her even with great thaumaturgy or ritual spells.

**Independent Action: [B]**

The ability to act independently for a period even if magic energy supply from the Master is severed.

At B rank, even if he loses his Master he is able to stay materialized for a period of 2 days. Seriously Nobbu, that a scout ability ain’t it!


## Personal Skills

**War Strategy: [B]**

The ability to perceive things such as diplomacy and logistic in a large perspective, assuring victory before the battle begin.

In the history of Japan, during the Battle of Okehazama she had executed an unparalleled form of surprise attack; however, it had been a fluke.

In Nobunaga’s lifetime, it had been the one great battle that overturn strategic defeat into tactical victory, but that fight had been a desperation on her part. Even now she still reflects on it.

**Charisma: [B-]**

The ability and disposition in commanding armies. Improves the ability of her own army during group battle.

Charisma is a rare talent, and it can be said that B rank is sufficient for a leader of a country.

It is B- rank due to the inconsistencies in its efficacy.

(It is fundamentally not being utilized in FateGO)

**Tenka Fubu: [A]**

A unique skill belonging to Nobunaga, revolutioner of the era. A conceptual revolution that imposes the new upon the old.

Grants advantageous corrections to an extent on herself if her enemies are those with high rank “divinity” and “mystery”, or Heroic Spirits that are guardians of the system. With this, Nobunaga is able to fight advantageously against Heroic Spirit and Noble Phantasm possessing “divinity” and “mystery”.

On the other hand, against the likes of modern Heroic Spirits with thin mystery it displayes no effect whatsoever. The efficacy of her own Noble Phantasms and all of her Skills drops instead.

**Demon King: [A]**

A monster that had her past’s way of being distorted later on due to the image she had when she was alive. Her abilities and figures ended up transformed.

In Archer’s case, it is possible to voluntarily activates and deactivates it due to it being her own self-proclamation while alive. She is able to receive all the benefits and none the demerits.

A Skill falsely similar to Innocent Monster.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Sandanuchi - Three Thousand Worlds

- Rank: E~A
- Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~99
- Maximum target: 3000 person

Three Line Formation.

Nobunaga’s three line shooting formation. An anti-army Noble Phantasm that deploys 3000 matchlocks and fires a volley of shootings.

From the exceedingly famous anecdote of her destroying the warring states strongest riding corps, its power is increased against Heroic Spirits possessing the Riding Skill.

They are simple matchlocks against those without the Skill, but even so simply a volley of 3000 shootings is a threat of its own.



# Dairokutenmaouhajun - Demon King of the Sixth Heaven Papiyas
- Rank: E~EX
- Type: Anti-Divine Noble Phantasm
- Range: -
- Maximum target: -

Dairokutenmaouhajun.

The true Noble Phantasm of Demon King Nobunaga, destroyer of gods and buddhas. A Reality Marble that transforms her into an existence wielding an absolute power against those possessing mystery and divinity. Visual-wise, it looks as if she took off her clothes. Yey!

The severe deeds that she had done during her live, represented in her setting ablaze Mt. Hiei, turned into a Noble Phantasm.

By means of the fear of Nobunaga that the people would embrace and accumulate in later years, and of the sense of awe for Nobunaga, it materializes as a great inferno.

For those possessing a high divinity, it is hard to even maintain their existence within it.

However, those with low divinity would as expected only felt a little hot.

(In FateGO, it is fundamentally not utilized.)

# Character

## Pronouns

- First pronoun: washi/ware
- Second pronoun: sonata/omae/kisama, etc
- Third pronoun: oyatsu/are, etc

## Personality

The king of reform, who takes the title of demon for herself.

Haughty and full of confidence in herself, she possesses the flexible mind that is fond of new things and isn’t enslaved by antiquated customs. Soft on those she likes in self-righteousness, thoroughly cold to those she hates, and indifferent towards those without any use.

## Attitude Towards Master

Specially favors the Master as her vassal. According to her: “You are the only vassal I have ever favored this much besides the Monkey. Rejoice!”

The demon king’s end was by the rebellion of her vassal; however, she doesn’t regret it, as it in itself is something “inevitable”.

She does not particularly hold any wish towards the Holy Grail, but it’s quite possible that she would use the Holy Grail itself for unprecedented ideas that is her forte and makes a mess out of everything.

## Dialogue Examples

“It is inevitable!”

“I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga!”

“I would allow jest, but not contempt. Never forget of this.”

“H-How exhausting...” (guda guda)

“Nobbu!” (*Small Nobu)

“Nobbu~!” (Big Nobu)


## Historical Character and Figure

A figure that had truly brought about ruin to the Muromachi Shogunate, and had bestowed great influence in the ending of Onin War to the continuing long period of Warring States. One of the three great heroes of the Warring States, It is no exaggeration to say that this personage is the most famous figure in the history of Japan.

In early years he had been harshly known as the Fool of Owari, or the great fool, but became serious upon inheriting the position of family head and suppressing his brother and crushing the war daimyo “Imagawa Yoshimoto” who had been known as a Kaidouuchi no Yumitori (1) with a somewhat desperate surprise attack. He then jumped out to the top in the race of unifying the country.

Afterwards, he completely demonstrated a natural eye for strategy, beat the hell out of the other daimyo in her surroundings, put them under her control and well extended her influence, and finally proceeded to the capital. After taking it as an easy game and putting on the composure that the warring state period is laughably complacent, as everyone would know, he would then meet her death at the age of 49 at Honnouji, just one step awaw from the unification of the whole country. The figure who unexpectedly embodies a man's life of 50 years.(2)

In FateGO, as can be seen Nobunaga is a woman. From the beginning, her father Oda Nobuhide had planned on giving the position as the head of family to her brother, Oda Nobukatsu. However, the time being the period of war, Nobukatsu’s caliber was judged to be impossible to protect House of Oda from then on, and so Kipposhi (later known as Nobunaga) who had an unusual hint for greatness despite being a woman was placed as the family head instead. Eh? It’s impossible for women to become the family head? Even the Dragon of Echigo (3) seems to be a woman as well, what’s the problem then!? Don’t underestimate the warring states.

After inheriting the position of family head, she continued to behave as a male would. But the information regulation on that matter would then be transmitted in the later years as Nobunaga’s eccentricity in her younger days, such as being “the Great Fool of Owari”. It can be said that the concealment of Nobunaga’s various amusing episode was that of a woman was thanks to her retainer’s effort of information manipulation.

“Well, it is inevitable!”

## TL Notes

1) Basically a title for Sengoku warlords, usually referring to daimyo of Tokaido
2) lyrics of Atsumori, said to be Nobunaga’s favorite song
3) aka Uesugi Kenshin. Which is apparently a girl in GO.

## General weaponry

* Matchlock
* Japanese sword (Heshikiri Hasebe)

## Related Characters

**Okita Souji**

Competed against her in a certain Holy Grail War. Being a modern Heroic Spirit with weak mystery, she should have had bad compatibility against her, but in FateGO suddenly their compatibility is reversed. Wowzers, Nobbu! Tomorrow is Honnouji!

## Comment from the Illustrator

She was so cute in Gudaguda Order…. while feeling that, I was charmed by how her design combines between cool factor and her unbounded manner, and (ok can someone help me with this sentence :描いたら好き勝手何故か公式で描く羽ｍ。。。描かせていただくことに。The m is actually there, I dunno if this is a typo or what)

Be it being serious or being amusing, she is always so cute that I always enjoy it whenever I’m drawing her. Personally I think that she acquired the Heshikiri Hasabe after materializing. Together with the clothes. (pako)
