## Class Skills

**Mad Enhancement: [EX] (equivalent to [C])**

Since he’s a Berserker class born from a wish to the Grail, while it equals to C rank, it’s possible to have a logical conversation.
However, since any use of sophistry has no effect, and decisions other than heading towards the target and pushing forwards won’t happen, it can be said that a conversation with the opponent is substantially impossible.

**Divinity: [C]**

Aptitude to be a Divine Spirit.
Cú Chulainn, who is the child of the Sun god Lugh, is endowed with high aptitude to become a Divine Spirit.
Since he’s been Altered, his Divinity is a rank down from usual.


## Personal Skills

**Battle Continuation: [A]**

Doesn’t know when to give up to the bitter end. The tenacity of a beast.
The ability to continue fighting. Can survive as long as he doesn’t receive a decisive fatal wound, and it’s possible to fight even if he receives wounds that leave him on the verge of death.

**Madness of the Elementals[1]: [A]**

The bellow of Cú Chulainn awakens the Elementals sleeping in the earth and crushes the mentality of the soldiers from the enemy army. A mental interference.
Temporarily ranks down the Strength and Agility parameters of all members of the enemy front.

**Rune Magecraft: [B]**

Possession of Scandinavian Magic Crests, Runes.
At the time of manifestation in this state, Cú Chulainn automatically activates the magecraft equivalent to the 「Magic Resistance」 skill.
(Fundamentally not used in 『FateGO』)

**Protection against Arrows: [C]**

A defensive effect against projectile weapons.
Evades projectiles seen with the eyes that aren’t caused by magecraft.
Since he’s maddened, it suffers a drastic rank-down from usual.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Gáe Bolg - Spear of Gouging and Piercing Massacre
- Rank: B++
- Type: Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 5~50
- Maximum number of targets: 100 people

Gáe Bolg.
A homing demonic spear missile. Almost the same Noble Phantasm as when usually summoned.
By throwing his automatic tracking demonic lance, he sweeps up the enemies within range. Since it’s a full-power throw to the degree of being willing to collapse his own body, its power and effective range have risen when compared to his usual summoning. It has an instant death effect against the entire enemy front, and deals great damage in the case of not dying instantly.
Since he’s throwing 「while regenerating the collapsing body」through Rune magecraft, Cú Chulainn doesn’t receive damage, but can’t prevent the sharp pain.
(Fundamentally not used in 『FateGO』)


# Curruid Coinchenn - Beast of Crunching Death Fangs
- Rank: A
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: —
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person

Curruid Coinchenn.
The rage of the rampaging Cú Chulainn temporarily embodies the skeleton of the monster of the Red Sea who became the origin of the demonic spear Gáe Bolg, the marine beast Curruid, and clads his body in it as an armor. An offensive-type bone armor. Wearing it ranks-up his Endurance, and his Strength parameter becomes EX.
『Soaring spear that strikes with death』 can’t be used while activating this Noble Phantasm.

# Character

## Pronouns

First person pronoun: 俺 (ore)
Second person pronoun: お前 (omae) / てめぇ (temee) / 貴様など (kisama nado)
Third person pronoun: あいつ (aitsu)

## Personality

Cú Chulainn, who has become a king of massacre.
He has acquired a ferociousness and nature like those of a beast, but the vigor of his life force isn’t something to 「survive」, but to 「lead to death」.
What is the wish of a beast? It’s not survival. It’s dashing. Beasts eat meat to survive and not to scamper. That’s why this Cú Chulainn discards even the desire to “eat” as useless.
Just fast. Just far. Just meaninglessly. As if believing that the place where he will fall after using up all his strength is his goal.

He will murder the enemy whether it’s a good person, a Heroic Spirit, or a friend.
He doesn’t think fighting is fun. If it’s standing as an enemy, he won’t hesitate even if he’s facing Scáthach.
If an ally repeats a mistake, there won’t be mercy.
The lack of pangs of the one who stands at the top of the soldiers of the warrior race, the Celts, would make anyone shake.

## Attitude Towards Master

The attitude towards the Master is complete indifference.
Since he thinks of himself as a battle machine and as a blade, he won’t oppose any unreasonable order if he thinks it’s not impossible.
However, he won’t respond to any order that has to do with doing something other than battle related things at all.
He has the strong will to think he’s just a being that kills the enemies, and not to be concerned in anything besides that.

## Dialogue Examples

『I’m an unimportant warrior of Ulster.
Since I’ve been summoned as a Servant, I’ll do what I gotta do』

『Don’t take the personality of Servants much into account. We’re weapons after all.
They too, I too, will turn into enemies at any moment if it’s necessary』

『All curses released. No moderation, challenge despair…… Curruid Coinchenn!』

## Historical Character and Figure

The brave hero of the Celtic Ulster cycle.
A member of the Order of the Red Branch as well as Ulster’s strongest warrior, he won fame by freely using the invincible demonic spearmanship received from the leader of the spirit world 「The Land of Shadows」, Scáthach.
Manifesting as a Berserker, the equipment of his whole body turns black, and his personality changes too. His facial expression is ruthless, his Noble Phantasm demonic spear becomes red mixed with black, and he projects a sinister presence.

A Servant reflecting Queen Medb’s wish for 「Cú Chulainn to be an evil king similar to me」. He abandoned the cheerfulness of Cú Chulainn, and exposed his side as a battle machine.

That the Celtic soldiers opposed in the fifth chapter were merciless was not only by Medb’s power, but also because they were led by Cú Chulainn’s cruelty.
He continues fighting not out of joy as a warrior, but only in order to prove that he’s the 「king」.
Many Servants have accused his way of being of 「foolish」, but that’s natural. The 「kings」 that Cú Chulainn saw were, without exception, foolish.
That said, his thirst for victory is by far stronger than that of the normal Cú Chulainn. That’s because winning is an obvious duty.
Logical cogitation and speech are possible, but since all of them are vectorially directed to 「winning battles」, a conversation with the opponents can’t fundamentally be established. Because of that, he has no mercy and begging for one’s life has no effect.

He can throw Gáe Bolg with its throwing version, but the power is higher than that of the usual Gáe Bolg.
As a compensation, his right arm will be damaged to the point of being torn off each time he activates it, but that’s compensated by regenerating and recovering it with Rune magecraft.
Only the sharp pain, enough to make an ordinary person go crazy, can’t be prevented, but Cú Chulainn eludes it by simply enduring it.

## Related Characters

**Medb**

She gave birth to Cú Chulainn (Alter). The queen that kept directing her impossibly distorted, as well as ardent, affection to him.

**Scáthach**

The largest wall. Crush her, overcome her, trample her. Don’t long to battle, aspire to win. Simply just feed the emptiness gained after winning to the dogs.

**Cú Chulainn**

My positive side. ……Ain’t he too bright? Is this for real?

## Comment from the Illustrator

I got a designation to do a distorted king Cú Chulainn, but Cú Chulainn has the image of a warrior in my head, so I went through Hell working to fill the image gap. The number of rejected drafts is overwhelmingly larger compared to other characters, and in the end I put all the parts together and made him thorny with tail, cape, and tattoos, but it caused a lot of trouble with the consistency in the three views. Since what he’s wearing is the skeleton of Curruid, same as his spear, as armor, I introduced marine life designs on the whole. (Shimadrill)

## TL Notes

[1]: 精霊 is "spirit", but it's used to refer to Elementals in the Nasuverse, so I changed the translation to make it more fitting.
