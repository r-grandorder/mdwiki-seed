## Class Skills



**Independent Action: [A+]**



While she doesn’t enjoy solitude, she has something of a habit of strolling alone. She’s good at trailing and similar activities. Running out of mana theoretically pains her a lot, but due to her dim senses, she doesn’t notice it.



**Magic Resistance: [D]**



The benefit of being a Servant.



Fujino, a frail user of telekinesis, is unconsciously forming force fields when fighting.



**Territory Creation: [B]**



Her eyesight can be considered preeminent because her abilities include a distant sight ability close to Clairvoyance.



Her power to comprehend the space around her and see her target behind shelters comes close to being a form of Bounded Field.



## Personal Skills



**Mystic Eyes of Distortion: [EX]**



Our good old twister Fujinon.



A first-class item even among the paranormal abilities known as Mystic Eyes.



A paranormal among the paranormal, a rarity among the rarities. They perceive *anything that physically exists*, organic or inorganic, as a printed image and twist it, distorting and severing the target, regardless of size or strength.



They surpass the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception in their of destructive power, but they're not almighty.



Because, since the distortion requires perceiving **an existence** on its entirety, it can’t bend the ground or **the being known as a city**. Also, because once the distortion is activated, you can avoid damage by moving away from its area.



**Clairvoyance (Darkness): [C]**



Some lights can only be seen by eyes that lost their lights.



Strictly speaking, this is the psychic ability Clairvoyance. It’s not the same thing as the Clairvoyance mages use (Senrigan). Depending on how she uses it, she can have a bird-eye’s view of the scenery, making it distinguishedly compatible with Mystic Eyes of Distortion.



**Remaining Sense of Pain: [A]**



She’s fully healed, and yet she’s still constantly feeling the pains of death. The proof that she’s human.



Since the Asakami clan sealed her ability, this sensation was locked away.



## Noble Phantasm(s)



# Yuishiki / Waikyoku no Magan (Vijnapti-Matrata / Mystic Eyes of Distortion)

- Rank: EX
- Type: Anti-World Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1-9999



That thing that happened in that nostalgic summer.



Sight away from human sight, caused by her Clairvoyance aggravating…Using a bird-eye’s view, the gods’ point of view, she *visually confirms* her target and uses a twisting super-long-range physical collapse.



Her locked pain bursts out and forms a spiral.



Its crumble is like that of a girl breaking down in tears.



# Character



## Pronouns



- First person pronoun: watashi
- Second person pronoun: Name with -san/ anata
- Third person pronoun: ano kata/mina-san
- Master: Young mage-san/name-san. In the most critical moments, Master.



## Personality



A girl on her late teens. A mild and passive personality.



The very image on a modest girl from the ancient times, the type that respects her husband.



She’s afraid of men for their violent side, while also finding this childish aspect of them adorable.



That’s why she is propense to feel more (romantic) attraction than affection for perfectly rational people.



She’s a skilled woman who follows common sense and honors her companies, but she is fundamentally a complete pessimist and realist, so she occasionally voices bitter opinions.





She’s very patient, but once she gets past her limit, she can be an uncontrolled dump truck, who doesn’t stop until she cornered her enemies (until the situation is solved).



She’s similar to Shiki on how merciless they are in their decisions.





Despite her feminine behavior, speech and personality, her tastes are far from ladylike. She likes dark contents, secretly enjoying horror movies and such on her own.



Fujino herself will never notice this, but she has a latent sadistic nature. That’s the reason why she gets cruel, cold-blooded and tasteless when she is chasing after others.



## Attitude Towards Master



The era when Fujino lived was instantly turned to ashes by the Human Order Incineration.



She was burned along with it, but the world’s Counter Force didn’t overlook the Singularities.



The Arayashiki uses her paranormal ability as one of its weapons to overturn the Human Order Incineration, leading to her being summoned by Chaldea as a temporary Servant.



To her, her current self is just a dream. Like with Shiki, it’s an one-night illusion she’s seeing immediately before she’s fully burnt, who will just disappear if the Human Order Incineration is not overturned.



A person of normal sensibilities would be confused and panicking, but Fujino has accepted her paranormal abilities with no objections. She accurately understands her position as a summoned Servant and will work to help her Master as far as she can.



## Dialogue Examples



“Please stay where you are, everyone. I will unrestrain myself, just a little.”



“Bend…”



“Here should be safe. Everyone is tired, so should we stop for tea for some 30 minutes?”



“I see. I also feel like I’m dreaming. I know this is strange, but this is the first time my heart raced this much.” // She was the only one having a light-hearted response when Azaka and friends were thrown into a zombie movie situation.



“I can’t handle violent men. But they are like troublesome children and that’s a little cute, don’t you agree?”



“…Indeed, I can’t identify the cause of death. When a body gets this dark, its insides don’t look too much different from those of a dissected frog. But I think I can at least identify the culprit. Wouldn’t you agree, Kokutou-san?”



“H… Stop… I wasn’t prepared… It’s unfair of you to always make laugh when I’m not prepared.” //Trying not to laugh.



## Character in FGO



A girl found in the Variant Singularity/Bounded Formula.



She has a girls’ academy uniform of strict tastes, discreet expressions, and an overly drastic dynamism. Everything about her is regular, but in a way that makes you feel the risk that something is out of place.



She possesses the Mystic Eyes of Distortion, which twist anything in her sight, ignoring hardness, size and composition.



It’s said that her family name Asagami (“shallow above”) was previously written as Asakami (“shallow gods”), and that they are lineage of sybils channeling gods (paranormal abilities).



A girl who lived her life not knowing pain, since one of her five senses, touch, was numbed.



As she doesn’t know pain, she can’t empathize with how others feel and isolated herself from the social circles.



Fujino, intelligent since a young age, lived hiding the fact that she’s insensitive to pain, and also faking her emotions, in order to let everyone know that “I am a normal human being” to protect herself.





A Servant added in the Kara no Kyoukai collab event’s rerun.



She will never appear in the story. She’s just a special participant joining the battle exclusively as fanservice.



## Related Characters



**Ryougi Shiki (Assassin):**



She approaches her calmly to say “Our previous connection is already over”.



But, they wouldn't hesitate to kill the other if the situation demands it again.



Both of them are identical on how they think this is natural. You can consider them friends that don’t feel any need to hold anything back around each other.



**Ryougi Shiki (Saber):**



“That Shiki-san… is very feminine. She talks more gently than the usual Shiki-san, and she’s so tender… this greatly annoyed me.



So much that would rather have the usual Shiki-san a roommate over her.”



On the other hand, Fujino feels hostility towards the graceful feminine form of Ryougi Shiki.



**?????? ????:**



“A high-schooler with long, flowy dark hair and a gallant demeanor… She strongly reminds me of a close friend of mine.



Her personality is… quite different, however. But I do love the beams. Beams are nice.”



**Mecha Eli-chan, Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II:**



“The number one Servant I would like to see appearing at the gulf coast.



I believe we would get along greatly with each other…”



## Comment from the Illustrator



This is a guest fighter from Kara no Kyoukai. The first ascension is the Reien uniform we all already knew. The second ascension is her as an Ahnenerbe Café waitress. Since this is a crossover, I doubled down on the fanservice and made her into her Mahou Tsukai no Hako version. Although I decided on those two practically immediately, I didn’t know what to do for the third ascension. I thought of doing “Asakami Fujino”, from a situation where the Asakami never downgraded into the Asagami, so first tried to work around a design with a miko image to it, yet nothing seemed to work. Then I switched lanes upon thinking “Wait, the Asakamis were more like shamans than mikos”, and settled down with the current design. (Takashi Takeuchi)
