## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [D]**

Invalidates spells of one stage (Single Action).
The level of Magic Resistance of an amulet that repels magecraft.

**Independent Action: [A]**

A skill that represents how he can manifest for a long time even in absence of a Master or without mana supply.
If it’s in a situation inside the mountains, and waiting motionlessly for his prey without moving, the effect rises more.

## Personal Skills

**Hunter of Uri: [B]**

The techniques of hunting he learned while living with the nature in the province of Uri, currently in central Switzerland.
What lies at the basis of the widely known famous hunter.
Compositely includes several skills and techniques related to hunting such as obviously treatment of the crossbow, good visual acuity, the ability to grasp the target with the eyesight, creation of traps, their adequate installation… and so forth.
In the mountains of Uri it’s equivalent to EX.
If he takes time to get used to mountains he doesn’t know, the skill rank rises substantially.

**Unwavering Patience: [C]**

Waiting for the prey still and without moving when it’s cold or when it’s hot, with a patience like a huge rock.
The reason why this skill is separated while parts of it are contained within the 1st skill is because this patience is the basis of a lifestyle of him providing for his family in a rustic way that goes along with nature and not having a gaudy life, and because according to legend he used this for other things besides hunting.
After the incident of the apple on his son’s head, he lurked patiently in the mountains, and waited for the evil governor to cross a defile.
Everything until now, and everything from now on. What should be done, and what must be done.
While thinking about that, he kept waiting, still, still ———.

**Aiming: [EX]**

A skill that represents the ability to take aim with projectiles.
Ability to concentrate as the hunter who ran through the mountains of Uri. Can even shoot through the apple placed on top of his son’s head.
In addition to the high concentration to put even breathing and heartbeats under perfect control, by perfectly adapting them to the environment of the external world without being noticed,
he doesn’t 「hit」, but gets the result of 「naturally hitting」.
This is said to be connected to the spirituality of Japanese archery in Orient.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Apfel Schießen: Released first arrow of faith
- Rank: C
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~50
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person

Apfel Schießen.
The reading means 『Shooting the apple』.
The legendary arrow shot with a crossbow that admirably pierced the apple placed on top of his son’s head.
This arrow released after receiving the trust on the son’s father will never fail, and will 『certainly』 pierce the target.
Summarizing, this Noble Phantasm has the property of interfering with the law of cause and effect, and evasion is fundamentally impossible.

# Zweite Schießen: Released second best second arrow
- Rank: C+
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~50
- Maximum number of targets: 1 person

Zweite Schießen.
A second Noble Phantasm that is activated only supposing the case in which the first Noble Phantasm that 『will never fail』 misses.
It’s derived from the anecdote in which Tell, thinking on what would happen if he missed the apple on his son, had a hidden arrow in order to shoot at the evil governor Geßler.
This arrow is released at the same time 『it must be shot in the case of the first arrow missing』.
That means this arrow is a Noble Phantasm that is conceptually overlapped and exists multiple times.
If the first arrow hits properly it will never be activated.

As if he was saying 『If I miss the apple on top of my son’s head (the first shot) everyone will die, so I have to shoot at the governor that gave that order (second shot) if I fail』, depending on the situation it can be released deciding where to shoot it at.
It’s possible to choose the same target as the first shot as well, and it will certainly pierce the target by interfering with the law of cause and effect in the same manner.
However it’s hard to fire randomly since the mana consumption becomes intenser.
… Although the situation in which 『the first arrow that will absolutely hit』 fails is not frequently seen.

## Dialogue Examples

「Did you call? My name’s William Tell. You don’t seem to have the kind of face…
to ask me to shoot some beasts at the forest. Good grief…」

「I’d like you to know. That the evil governor’s heart and the apple above my head’s son weren’t fun to shoot at. …If I got in the same situation again, I don’t know if I could do the same thing」

「Wow, a mythological hunter? If there’s a chance I’d like both of us to go to the mountains.
It’d be nice to show that the Hunter of Uri’s skill is nothing to sneeze at…」

「Hehhe, I actually like new stuff. Whether it is for hunting or not, I surprisingly accept what I think it’s good easily. I’m fond of this crossbow and these clothes, and tobacco… Ah, having one smoke after finishing a hunt feels delicious…」

## Historical Character and Figure

William Tell (Wilhelm Tell in local Swiss German)
is a legendary character who lived at Uri, central Switzerland, in the late 13th century ~ early 14th century.
His name was popularized as a character appearing on a drama, but for the people of Switzerland,
he is accepted as a hero that symbolizes the nation building movement.

The region of Switzerland at that time was in a spot in which three provinces signed an alliance for their autonomous independence from the Habsburg family,
and created the base form of the later Swiss Federation.
In one of these provinces, Uri, lived an Austrian governor called Hermann Geßler.
He erected a pole on the central square and hung his hat on it, and forced the residents that passed in front of it to
bow their heads and pay respect to that hat.

But Tell, who passed in front of the hat together with his son, was arrested since he didn’t bow his head.
Geßler told Tell, who was an expert with the crossbow, 「If you can pierce an apple placed on the top of your son’s head I will forgive you」.
The young son refused to be tied up or blindfolded, and headed on his own accord to the trunk of a linden tree.
「Why do I need to be scared? I trust on my father’s skill. Come on Dad, show him」.
And so Tell splendidly pierced the apple above his son’s head thanks to that trust,
and the released father and child gave each other a tight hug.

Immediately after.
At the moment of shooting the apple, Geßler noticed that Tell had hidden another arrow in his pocket apart from the one nocked on his crossbow.
Geßler asked for the meaning of that arrow.
Then he announced 「Had the first arrow pierced something other than the apple, I intended to kill you with this arrow」
A wrathful Geßler arrested him again, and tried to drag him away from the country.
But Tell succeeded in escaping halfway and survived.

And ——— In order to escape from the governor’s revenge, in order to protect his sons from the governor’s rage,
Tell did what he had to do.
Tell sniped Geßler, who was riding a horse at a narrow defile, and pierced his heart.

The town that lost its tyrant returned to peace, Tell was praised as a hero,
and starting from this case, the momentum of the Swiss independent movement became increasingly stronger ———.

## Character in FGO

Just like the play depicts him, he’s a man with the courage to face the oppressors that make the people suffer.
But he wasn’t driven by a political · national sense of danger, if anything his motives were personal.
As a hunter, as a father, as a man.
As a result of doing what he had to do, he became a warrior of justice.
That means he became a realistic hero.
A sometimes shallow, sometimes warm, and scary when angry man that has the boldness and composure to protect his family, as if he embodied the concept of 『fathers are heroes』 itself.

## Standard Weapons

Crossbow.

## Comment from the Illustrator

William Tell-san’s image was 「Morizō」[1]. But, searching again Morizō is a quite monochrome green, it didn’t have multi-cam camouflage. William Tell-san couldn’t be that green…! He had the image of an austere father from the beginning, but I thought 「Is it too funky?」 when I painted his hair pink in a rush so I dropped the colorfulness. (Takahashi Keitarō)

## TL Notes:

1: Morizō is [this](https://pics.prcm.jp/f85b959a9ca9f/82515566/jpeg/82515566_220x219.jpeg) green fuzzy guy.
