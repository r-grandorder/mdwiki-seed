## Class Skills

**Presence Concealment: [A+]**

A skill suitable for espionage activities, hiding one's presence. If one completely hides their presence, discovery becomes nearly impossible. When launching an attack, the rank of the presence concealment greatly decreases, but this weakness is compensated for by "Murder of the Misty Night", allowing for a perfect surprise attack.

## Personal Skills

**Murder of the Misty Night: [A]**

Since her characteristics are that of a murderer rather than an assassin's, she, the assailant, always gets the first move against the enemy, the victim.
However, this only applies at night.

**Information Erasure: [B]**

The moment the confrontation ends, the information about things like her abilities, true name and features are wiped from the opponents and eye-witnesses' memory.

**Surgery: [E]**

Using her blood-stained scalpels, she can provide medical treatment to the Master as well as herself.
Although the visual aspects cannot be guaranteed, for the time being, she'll manage somehow or other.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Maria the Ripper: The Holy Mother of Dismemberment
- Rank: D+
- Class: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum number of Targets: one person

Maria the Ripper.
A Noble Phantasm that reenacts the murders of Jack the Ripper.
「Night time」 「The opponent is a woman (or simply female)」 「It's foggy outside」, when all these conditions are met and the Noble Phantasm is activated, the target's insides are forced outside of their body and they're turned into a disemboweled corpse.

In the case the conditions are not met, it's limited to plain damage, though it sharply rises in power every time one of the conditions are fulfilled.
Since this Noble Phantasm is not an attack performed with a knife, but a type of curse, it can be used even at long-range.
To defend against the Noble Phantasm, instead of physical defensive power, a resistance against curses is necessary.

# The Mist: Pitchblack Misty Metropolis
- Rank: C
- Class: Barrier-type Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~10
- Maximum number of Targets: 50

The Mist.
A Noble Phantasm that creates a barrier of mist.
The mist of sulfuric acid, created with magic power, is the Noble Phantasm itself.
If it's a Servant, they will receive no damage, but their Agility will decrease by a rank. The user can choose who will and who won't be affected by the mist among those inside her Noble Phantasm.
Since you lose your sense of direction inside the mist, a B or higher ranked "Instinct" skill or some kind of Magecraft is necessary to escape.
(It is not used in 『Fate/GO』.)

# Character

## Pronouns

First person pronoun: watashitachi[1]
Second person pronoun: ano hito/anata
Third person pronoun: aitsu

## Personality

Although she's innocent like a child, she knows she is a Servant and when it comes to battle, she is extremely quick-witted.
Love and the desire to kill coexist inside her, since she loves her loved ones, there is a risk of her murdering them.
Since, originally, she's an existence that shouldn't have been born, she's brimming with curiosity and wants to thrust her head inside everything.

## Attitude Towards Master

Whether the Master is a man or a woman, if they have the shape of a human, she'll call them 「Mother」. The nicer the Master is, the more emotionally attached she'll be, and, despite being Chaotic Evil, she'll show self-restraint to a certain extent. However, extreme caution is advised since there might come a time when she'll want to return to the womb saying 「The deeper our love becomes, the more we want to crawl inside your abdomen」.

「We want to return to Mother's womb」 is the wish she wants to entrust to the Holy Grail; in search of the place where she can be at comfort, she continues to wish for this from the Grail.

## Dialogue Examples

「From now on, it's Hell. We are flames, rain, power――――we'll slaughter you here. The Holy Mother of Dismemberment(Maria the Ripper)――――!!」

「The wish for the Holy Grail...is to go back inside Mother. For us, that is all we need.」

「Hold us tight...Hey? If it's for Mother's sake, we'll do anything.」

## Historical Character and Figure

The most famous murderer who will never be recorded in history――――That's Jack the Ripper... If a crime similar to what tha murderer committed happens, they'll call the perpetrator the 「Modern-day Jack the Ripper」 and each time - 「In the end, who in the world was he (she)?」 - an argument like this will unfold.

The reason his (her) name gets mentioned by people like this is that he was an enigmatic existence shrouded in mysteries.

It's a common occurrence for humans with power, like Gilles de Rais and Elizabeth Báthory, to go insane and carry out inhuman actions and this won't change no matter the era. A bizarre event will take place in any era, such as the concept of a murderer.

However, Jack the Ripper was a first in every aspect. Jack's targets were prostitutes from downtown where there was no money or anything. He did not do it for the gold or the body, he only left behind a gruesomely bloody murder scene that seemed to scream 「I just want to destroy a human body」. There were no witnesses or clues, an unidentified serial killer――――Jack the Ripper was that sort of an existence.

The identity of this time's Jack the Ripper who was summoned as an Assassin is a vengeful aggregation of 「children who could not be born」.
The body of a little girl formed by a large number of evil spirits pursuing their mothers.
However, since she is nothing more than an evil existence, her wish is not pleasant at all. She wants to return to her mother's womb.
With the body that has already taken the form of human being, she wants to go back into her mother's belly.

It is a hopelessly mistaken wish, but she does not desire anything else than that. The better person her Master is, the better her compatibility with them will be――――but no matter how good of a person they are, they should be able to understand that granting her wish is impossible.
For Jack the Ripper to find a new wish, it all depends on her Master. I hope they'll both fight hard.

...In any case, since this time, Jack the Ripper was summoned as an Assassin, she appeared as a little girl, however, if she was to be summoned as a different class, she would materialize in a different form.
In case Jack is summoned as a Berserker, due to all the minuses adding up, they would do a complete 180 and a 「level-headed Jack the Ripper whose mind did not collapse」 would be born.

**Nursery Rhyme**

Recently, she's being invited to tea parties at random. However, Jack, who ended up wandering off somewhere after finding something interesting, can be found being lectured. 「You have to be more lady-like!」

**Asterios**

Mr. Reindeer.

**Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily**

A new friend.
She's a little older age-wise, but the loveliness stemming from the fact that her seniority cannot be felt in the slightest is a bit enviable.

...Wait, what? You're adorable (and frightening) enough yourself, aren't you?[2]

## Comment from the Illustrator

The mantle-like clothing she has during summoning is an abandoned coat for men that she found somewhere. Catching glimpses of the underwear and the bare skin[3] is an essential point to wearing thick clothes. The second ascension's liberal look is aiming at the gap between it and the first ascension with its design. The character's image, which is adorably small, but gives off the feeling that you'll be cut if you let your guard down, is a fittingly frightening weapon. Even though the large variety of knives she possesses won't see much use, thinking about what purpose each could serve while I was arranging them was a ton of fun. (Konoe Ototsugu)

## TL Notes

[1] First-person plural version of watashi.
[2]I agree with the Narrator. Jack is best daughteru.
[3] Konoe (Jack's illustrator) mentioned チラリズム here. It's hard to explain, but I'll give it a try.
Basically, it's a fetish where people prefer to catch glimpses of underwear and the bare body due to some coincidence instead of blatant exposure of a nude body and their unmentionables. They prefer the lucky pervert moments.
...I had to look this nonsense up. Thanks, Konoe. I bet I did not even explain it properly.
