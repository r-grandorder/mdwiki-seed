## Class Skills

**Magic Resistance: [A]**

Invalidates magic A and below, no matter what kind of great thaumaturgy it is.
A hero is expected to do at least this much.

**Territory Creation: [C]**

The ability to create workshop and allied party.
This time it's the specialization of the ability to create campsite. A hero adventures on the field all week. The skill to swiftly establish a tent is the true mark of a leader.

**Double Class: [E]**

A miraculuous variant born from the union of Lancer and Caster.
No actual benefits in particular.

## Personal Skills

**Hero Grand Code: [EX]**

First, that a hero must be invincible.
Second, that a hero must always be in high spirit.
Third, that a hero freely makes use of lost properties.
......and so on and so on. Ten code in total.
As a Skill, think of it as a leading up towards the protagonist grand turn around, just like in action manga.
During that turn only, she is invincible and simultaneously has her willpower raised.
A hero shall accumulate NP as she endures multiple Noble Phantasm.

**Magic Energy Burst (Brave): [D]**

A Magic Energy Burst, but of an extremely rare internal type.
Defense power is raised. Subtly unpleasant.

**Legend of the Crimson Hero: [EX]**

The supreme privilege, the hero's greatest of esoterica usable only in the movie version.
A super power up by expending 100% NP. A super buff of a similar type to Tamamo-chan Summer's Goddess Transformation.
Randomly bestows miraculous effects such as super increase to offensive power, invincibility and recovery to entire party, and an acquisition of a large amount of stars. Unmistakably a gambler skill.
However, perhaps because it is a skill that displays each effects against formidable enemies, but during the occasion that such an enemy that does not depend on the system shows in front of her can a miracle happens only with this skill.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Bathory Brave Erzsebet - Bloody Tornado Demoness
- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Unit/Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm (yes, the mat said anti-unit twice)
- Range: 10-30
- Maximum target: 1 person
 
Bathory Brave Erzsebet.
Bloody Demoness, Saber version.
A forbidden sword technique that affix the enemy with the hero power like that of a storm, clash into that space a full power, high gear rotating thrust and made the enemy explode.

Of course, the hero power is by means of Elizabeth's sonic breath.
The super thunder screw slash unleashed to the enemy whose mind and body have been stunned by Elizabeth's super sonic waves pulverizes even the Slave Beast.

## Personality

The Elizabeth (Caster) who make Halloween merry and festive, turned into Saber at the end of elegant fate.
Her mood swing and wickedness took a dip, and although selfishness remains her personality becomes one that help the weak and outwit the strong.
Saber = Ally of Justice. Maybe that's what she think of it, but anyway she misunderstand herself as one positioned as a hero, and just like that she is giving it her all the Elizabeth way. Ish.
However, she is not used to be a character on the side of justice, so she messes up a lot as usual.

## Attitude Towards Master

She is a hero, so she is brimming with the spirit to fight alongside the Master.
She personally feels she is bound by a tight friendship with the Master.
Her awareness as a Servant is low.

## Dialogue Examples

"See here, I'm like, a hero right? And a hero must have a variety of party members, right? Just like when I was an idol, suppoerted by drums and instruments."
"No worries, puppy/deerlet! Because I, the hero, and this darkish no good trio will protect you!"
"Yes. I am the new me, emerging from humiliation and conflict, dispossessed of evertyhing to you. Class Saber type idol, Elizabeth Brave Bathory!"

## Character in FGO

Appearing as the main character of Halloween 2016.
With the power of dragon and music, as well as the second Halloween, it feels like nobody can stop her anymore.
With pure white mantle, deep crimson armor, and a simple sword without any decoration on her hand, today too shall the Hero Elizabeth conquer.
Well, she doesn't really practice any sort of sword skill, so she just blows it away with full power.
Bound with tight friendship with the Master, not even the sword of civilization destruction or theater of lasers or foxy curses can cut it apart. Is what she believes. (Due to that she has no awareness as a Servant.)

"Maybe I'm not actually a hero, just a sexy female knight, and the true hero is the puppy/deerlet..."

Is what going on her head sometimes, but that in itself is not bad, huh! is her positive thinking, following her own path. Truly a hero.

By the way the name of the sword is the famed sword Eighteen, and the name of the shield is the famed shield Retronia.

## Related Characters

**Cleopatra**

I must admit she is a genius. It's a bit unthinkable to put a castle on top of other's castle. It's like an ice cream, so cute! But spare me a third one.

**Robin Hood**

That Greeny. I had thought that he was simply a rat who would bite back at the feudal lord no matter what, but seems like depending on the situation he would help too. Maybe he has some kind of knightly groundings...? This time, I will show him how to Brave!

**Gawain**

Such a dreamy, prince charming of a Saber...! He must have only about 1 Buster Card. Unmistakably a magnificent Saber!

**Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily**

Christmas is a rival. I'm envious of box gacha and such, yes, but no thank you. Really, aren't you embarassed for picking up such a greedy atmosphere?

**Tamamo-chan Summer**

We are both anti-heroes, but I just can't win against that fox's free spirit... Actually, just when did she ended up getting the demon king role...

## Comment from the Illustrator

I got the assignment to make a bikini armor. Because of that, I just straight up draw the homage to Genmu Senki Leda's Yohko and Dragon Quest 3's Female Knight. Elizabeth has quite an extraordinary slender body, so she can totally pull it off with the bikini armor!!!!!!!!! (Wada Arco)
