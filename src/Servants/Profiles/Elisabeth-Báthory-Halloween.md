## Class Skills

**Territory Creation: [B]**

Creation of a territory that is advantageous to herself as a magus.

Even though there’s the power of the Holy Grail, her designing ability in remolding the prison castle Csejte into a merry castle is worthy of admiration.

**Tool Creation: [A]**

The ability to create various tools by means of magic.

Even though there’s there are Vlad III and Tamamo Cat helping her, the productivity in creating a massive amount of party supplies is worthy of admiration. Now if only the same can happen to her singing sense...

## Personal Skills

**Innocent Monster: [EX]**

Indicating the depth of distorted truth by means of rumours, without concern for the actual person's own will or appearance.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that Elizabeth, who had become the festival sponsor by means of the power of Holy Grail, is Halloween in and of itself. Maybe.

**Magic Energy Burst (Pumpkin): [A]**

Increases performance by means of infusing magic energy to one’s weapon or one’s own body and instantaneously ejecting it.

The spirit of Halloween dwells within Halloween Liz’s weapon and magic; in places bustling with festivals brawls, it displays effectiveness equals to that of first class Magic Energy Burst. However, those pumpkin spirits only materialize due to Elizabeth’s magic energy to begin with. Which comes first, the pumpkin or the Elizabeth?

**Performance Continuation: [A]**

The variation of the Skill Battle Continuation.

Due to her comeback as the leading actor, a bunch of critical stars comes out. Why can’t she use this guts for other things, really.

# Bathory Halloween Erzsebet - Bloody Extra Special Demoness

- Third pronoun: anatatachi (no honorifics)

## Personality

Pretty much the same with Elizabeth, so it’s omitted. This is totally not cutting corners, ok!?

## Attitude Towards Master

Elizabeth had been lost in the merry atmosphere of Halloween, so her chronic headache and sudden mood swing is currently being suppressed, fearlessly facing the Master from the front.

Due to her no longer attacking humans irrespective to her own intention, she will give it her all to gain the Master’s trust.

This is a one night dream. An impossible if that the criminal beyond salvation known as Elizabeth Bathory saw.

## Dialogue Examples

“Trick or treat! I don’t need to introduce myself, right? I, the Bloody Demoness Elizabeth Bathory, answers your passionate yell as I arrive here with my hidden dress!”

“Aaand I’m here! Right now, I can even save the world with my song! Come here, last stage! Caster, Elizabeth Bathory-----shall sing her greatest yet!”

## Character in FGO

The countess of blood who became the model for the vampire Carmilla… who got demonized but the Skill Innocent Monster…. who got infused with the attribute of Halloween due to the Holy Grail that she happens to pick up. This is beyond comprehension.

She is a heap of a Servant*, admiring the culture of idol while also having the attribute of a princess dreaming in her castle. Completely cutting off her anecdote of piercing torture Iron Maiden by treating it as “totally have nothing to do with me”, she changes her weapon from a spear to a fork. Due to her overflowing magic energy, she is able to perform magic even if she had never really learn it. She herself totally doesn’t get how it works. An overflowing yet hidden talent, without a clue on how to use it; how very Elizabeth.

*as in Servants with heaps of attributes

## Related Characters

**Santa Alter**

An undeniable relation as she is a festival-type Servant.

That being said, Elizabeth is also able to enjoy Christmas too; so she doesn’t get why she is being targeted.

**Tamamo Cat**

A drifting Servant who came as an helper, pronouncing herself as an all-purpose maid.

It was really surprising; employed even as a vital member during battle, she truly is all-purpose. Afterwards, she kept her company as a comparatively reliable friend.

## Comment from the Illustrator

She’s a Caster that I drew under the impression that she’s a Lancer… like, I’m really sorry. It’s not a lance, it’s a fork, so please forgive me...! Her clothing is pretty showy, and I’m pleased with that. I don’t have a 5 star Caster other than Tamamo, so everytime I need some firepower for a Caster assault it’s always HalloEli. Due to that, I’m seeing her a lot., so I’m glad I got her clothes good. Please give more event Servants!!!! (Wada Arco)
