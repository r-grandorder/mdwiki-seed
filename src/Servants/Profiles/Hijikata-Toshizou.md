## Class Skills



**Mad Enhancement: D+**

He is Shinsengumi itself; as long as he is here, even alone, then Shinsengumi shall never die. Such was the intense self-confidence which drives insane of his mind.

Alone at the beginning, alone at the end; the lone Shinsengumi.



## Personal Skills



**Demon of the Battlefield: B**

A Skill which rouses his allies through his personal prowess and valor. Strengthen himself as well as the troops he leads beyond their original abilities.

The way he fights, just like that of a demon, sometimes strikes fear even towards his allies.



**Disengage: C**

The ability to withdraw from battle, or to reset the state of affairs. It also returns disadvantageous battle to its initial state and skill condition to its starting value.

Simultaneously, several bad statuses are compulsorily cancelled. When he was alive, every time he thought of losing he would always rise again and continue to fight.[1]



**Military Tactics: D**

A tactical, instinctive ability in regards not of one-on-one battle, but of battle involving large numbers.It grants advantageous correction in the case of using one’s own anti-army Noble Phantasm, or when dealing against the enemy’s anti-army Noble Phantasm.

(In FGO, it is fundamentally not utilized)



**Kyokuchuu Hatto[2] : EX**

One is to not go against the samurai code (prohibition of combats unworthy of a warrior)

One is to not to escape from the office (prohibition of rescinding one’s contract)

One is to not raise money on their own accord (prohibition of furnishing materials from others)

One is to not handle litigations on their own accord (prohibition of rescinding combat status by means of negotiation)

One is to not engage in personal battles (prohibition of battles outside of the Master’s instruction)



A Skill that places compulsory restraints upon oneself. He would receive damage should he breach those prohibitions; however, his statuses would rise in exchange. Breaching all prohibitions would render him immobile.

Normally, breaching the prohibitions that which a Shinsengumi regimental soldier would have never been allowed to breach would gradually render one insane.

It is the embodiment of his resolution and madness; of one who still aspires to be Shinsengumi, even after he threw away his pride as a warrior.

[1] we had BC with disengage effect before. Now here we are, disengage with BC flavor

## Noble Phantasm(s)



# Shinsengumi: Undying Fidelity



* Rank: C+
* Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
* Range: 1
* Max. Targets: 1 unit



Shinsengumi.

The flag of fidelity is him, him alone; and for as long as he is here, it shall never die. The Noble Phantasm in which his intense pride and madness interweave.

Even within his corps, by no means he is their better in terms of sword skills; however, regardless of friend or foe, all profess thus: “I may not lose against Hijikata, but neither do I feel I would be able to win”. Such was the sword of carnage belonging to the war demon, Hijikata Toshizou.

Upon invocation, degradation of physical abilities due to bodily injury is temporarily made invalid; it makes it possible for him to use any means and to continue fighting until all enemies’ are slaughtered. However, it is a double-edged sword which bursts all damage received in one go when its period of effect ends.

Such was truly the reappearance of his lifetime, in which he never ceased fighting. When invoked, his surrounding transforms into a battlefield where bullets fly about as guns roar. It displays the aspect of an anti-army Noble Phantasm through a large number summoning, yet its true essence is something completely different. All of it is a manifestation of his madness, in which “even now, Shinsengumi is here.”



“Shinsengumi… is… here…, Shinsengumi… IS…. ME!!!”



# Character



## Pronouns



* First pronoun: ore
* Second pronoun: omae/kisama, etc
* Third pronoun: yatsu/are, etc



## Personality



The public order organization which was active during the Bakumatsu period in the heart of Kyoto, Shinsengumi.

The demonic vice chief who leads the Shinsengumi, feared even among this group of swordsman, Hijikata Toshizou.



The samurai who threw away his pale blue haori, settled in western clothing, took up guns in his arm, and continued to fight against the era so as to persist in his fidelity.

Contrary to his demonic style of fighting, he is a rationalist in regards to the battlefield, possessing the flexibility to make use of anything and everything if it is for the sake of victory as well.

His skill with the sword does not particularly stand out within the group of master swordsman; however, when it comes to cutting down each other, when it comes to real combat where anything and everything goes--such as throwing sands on the opponents’ eyes or strangling them down--he is absurdly strong.

While he is Berserker, it is possible for him to hold normal conversation, as well as performing tactical judgement.

His madness is aggregated in his severely subjective impression, in which the Shinsengumi is yet to die.



He is Shinsengumi; even alone, so as long as that he is here, then Shinsengumi shall never die.

His pride, which can be said to be madness already, is so much that he did not even realize that he had become a Heroic Spirit in death.

Only the word fidelity is his support, one which drives him insane.

Never ceasing to fight. While knowing that he is truly beyond salvation, for the sake of fidelity.



The demonic vice chief, burdened with the stigma of fidelity.



## Attitude Towards Master



He treats the Master as an ordinary regimental soldier. He deals with him with the strict attitude of the Shinsengumi vice chief.

The moment the Master that summoned him gives up on fighting, he or she immediately becomes the target for purging.

His outward appearance of unexpectedly caring for others is good, but due to his brusque manner of speaking, there are also times where he was misunderstood.

His favorite dish is takuan; so much so that it is said that he came back while shouldering the takuan he likes by the barrel.

His lifetime of the Kyoto era was exceedingly popular; due to that, it is said that he had many scandals circulating about.

His hobby is haiku.



## Dialogue Examples



* “....Shinsengumi is me.”

* “SHINSENGUMI IS HERE!”

* “I will cutdown those who step back; there is naught to do... but to kill! Advance! KILL! ADVANCE!”

* “Draw your blade… and attack…. Shinsengumi, FORWARD!”

* “Lawbreaker, is it…. Then, seppuku.”



## Historical Character and Figure



Vice chief of Shinsengumi, the public order organization which was active during the Bakumatsu period in the heart of Kyoto.

He is feared as the demonic vice chief who imposes severe discipline within the group by the master swordsman set of regimental soldiers.

During childhood, he was an exceedingly bad boy, even nicknamed as the “Baragaki of Bushu”. He had immediately picked up a fight with the head upon entering apprenticeships and was made to leave his post afterwards. An extreme problem child.



While he peddled his family’s secret medicine, it was also around that time when he rampaged and laid to waste many swordsmanship dojo in various of places, acquiring much experience.

Afterwards, he began training in the dojo of Tennenrishinryuu and met the future chief of Shinsengumi, Kondou Isami, as well as the future captain of its first unit, Okita Souji.



In Bunkyuu era, third year, second month, together with his Shieikan[1] comrades he enlisted to the Roushigumi which aim is to guard the then shogun, Tokugawa Iemochi. Going towards Kyoto was the turning point of his life.

After the Roushigumi are divided , together with Kondou and Okita they form the Shinsengumi via the predecessor organization of ronin groups.

As Kondou’s right hand man, oftentimes he had to purge by assassination the antagonistic Serizawa Kamo and the Mitogaku. He had made complete the organisation with the Shieikan faction and consequently Kondou at the summit of it.

Through their activity in the Rebellion of Hamaguri, the Ikedaya Incident, and many others, the Shinsengumi had been approved even by the shogunate and experienced the peak of its time.

However, the shogun Yoshinobu performed the restoration of imperial rule, losing to the new government army during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi.

Sensing disadvantage in the state of war, the regimental soldiers then deserted one after another, and there are others who detached themselves out of policy differences.

Afterwards, Kondou was captured by the new government army and executed, Okita died due to his illness, and Shinsengumi in effect met its end.

However, Hijikata alone hoisted the flag of Shinsengumi still; he headed north as he fought the new government army and at the end of it finally managed to arrive at the Goryoukaku[2] at Hakodate.

It is said that Hijikata insisted of resistance to the bitter end towards his allies who advocated him to surrender, and at the end of it, he assaulted the new government army in order to save the regimental soldiers who was fighting them, and died when a bullet shot him.



His comrades, whom he soared together with through the era. One of them fell in battle; one of them fell to disease; still one of them fell through despair.

Nobody else is left standing besides him.

He is the beginning, as well as the last of Shinsengumi.



Carrying his oath beyond, with his fidelity here unwavering. [3]



# TL Notes

[1] the dojo location of tennenrishinryuu apprentices

[2] lit five sided fortifications

[3] I opted for a (very) liberal translation here, because literal translation of 誓いは彼方に誠はここに is just “oath beyond, fidelity here” which sounds awkward af.





## Standard Weapons



A Japanese sword (Izumi no Kami Kanesada)

Guns (Gerber gun)



## Related Characters



**Okita Souji**

An acquaintance since childhood. The moment he was about to hit a blow to Okita, who had only entered the dojo for the first time, for some reason he already fell senseless in bed. Hijikata still remembers of the dread of the excessive genius of the sword, which rendered even him speechless.



**Oda Nobunaga**

Although they in no way fit well with each other[1], their compatibility in regards of matters such as way of thinking in battle and rational aspect is not bad; good, even.



**Chacha**

Contrary to his expectation of her being a child, sometimes she strangely speaks to him while gazing at him from above; for that reason, he isn’t very good at dealing with her. Oi, don’t just go eating my takuan.



**Carmilla**

For some reason, they unexpectedly have many things to be in common related to torture. That being said, it is not that Hijikata enjoys torture; it is simply something he as a vice chief naturally has to do. Carmilla understands on that point, but that’s just that and nothing else; she beguilingly rouses him up with “You definitely have the talent for it, no?”



**Miyamoto Musashi**

“That’s Musashi of the Nitenichiryuu? Even jokes could only go so far…, no, let me think of it differently. Her being well developed is a good thing. A Sanzou priest is fine too!”



**Kondou Isami**

Deputy chief of the Shinsengumi. Although one might say that he is the one who dictated Hijikata’s life, he is a good person.



# TL Notes

[1] this sentence uses an interesting idiom, そり合わない, where a blade does not fit its scabbard



## Comment from the Illustrator



When this conversation was brought to me at the beginning, I didn’t know the Servant’s true name yet. After I officially took the contract, I was glad when I found out it was Hijikata Toshizou.

I’m from Hokkaido myself, so I’ve made way to the Goryoukaku plenty of times already, plus he’s also my favorite Shinsengumi figure. I’ve had plenty of fun drawing him. (Yogo Yuuki)
