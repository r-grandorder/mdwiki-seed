## Class Skills

**Mad Enhancement: [EX]**

Did a worm hatch in your brains?」

「Of course it’s wrong, this won’t beat that dōjin…!」
「I’m going to draw, with all my body and soul…!」

## Personal Skills

**Schwartzwald Falke: [B]**

German. It’s translated as falcon of the black forest, but… There’s no meaning… in particular….
Seems it was added 「because it’s somewhat cool」.
Mysterious power.[1]

**Fallen Witch: [A+]**

A transformation of the Dragon Witch skill,
due to the shift from the Avenger class.

**Meurs Où Tu Dois: [EX]**

Accurately, it’s “Va où tu peux, meurs où tu dois”.
Go to the place you must go, die at the place you must die… A French proverb.
For one reason or another, she who is an Avenger is looking for a place to die.
Not a pleasant, gentle death.
No matter how intense, how desperate it is.
Hoping that’s a satisfactory departure,
she continues fighting every day.


## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Völkemord Feuerdrache - Incinerated Rule of Heaven · Dragon of Extermination
- Rank: A+
- Type: Anti-Army
- Range: 1~5
- Maximum number of targets: 50 people

Völkemord Feuerdrache.
In order to compete with Jeanne Darc, the mountain instead of the sea.
Born of the idea of using fire instead of water.
Summons a black dragon-like thing with her power as the former Dragon Witch, and spreads disaster.
It’s not necessary to say the reason why it’s in German anymore.
Because it’s cool.

# Character

## Pronouns

First person pronoun: 私 (watashi)
Second person pronoun: アンタ (anta)
Third person pronoun: 彼 (kare) / 彼女 (kanojo)

## Personality

She became a Berserker from Avenger, but perhaps because the basis was easy to transform, the difference isn’t rather significant.
If anything, it’s to the point that the serious elements have disappeared.
She changed into a swimsuit and was full of motivation to enjoy Hawaii, but because she obtained a certain dōjinshi, the world changed.

## Attitude Towards Master

The usual familiar friend attitude.
She thinks it’s natural to involve him/her, and believes they’ll naturally follow her.

Even if the separation is contracted, even if she will eventually wake from her dream.
These memories are eternally hers.

As long as there’s that fact, she will always proceed to battle.

## Dialogue Examples

「The time has come. It is the beginning of Sabbath!
The crows sing, sing…, the black cat goes meow!」

「O’ three-headed black dragon,
eat away the world!
Völkemord Feuerdrache!」

「Tirelessly re-raising me from scratch.
You, do you like me that much?
Huum, well I’m a Servant
so I can’t answer to your feelings, though.
At least I’ll allow you to be at my side.
… What’s with those eyes?」

## Character in FGO

A central character in the summer event 「Servant Summer Festival!」.
She started up the circle 『Gespenst Ketzer』and continued drawing manga together with the protagonist.
Everything was because of her rivalry to Jeanne Darc, but it seems that there was at its basis there was something that couldn’t be attained without hatred and longing for『the development that was inconceivable』,『the story that should have been fulfilled』.

It is said that, after the summer event ended, even if she was amazed at herself and asked「Why was I so frantic?」, her sense of distance with liberal arts Servants is closer than before.

Also, as an aside, she won’t overlook that the reason why she was in such high spirits was because of Luluhawa’s air.
She was so looking forward to this trip that she read the airplane's guidebook taking notes with post-its.

Although she spent her days busy with manga, having been able to fully enjoy Luluhawa by making a loop became a memory she won’t forget in her whole life.

## Standard Weapons

Japanese blade ｘ3
· Arahabaki[2] 72 Flashes (Arahabaki Nana Jū Ni Sen)
· Great Black Poison Dragon All-Destruction (Black Mamba)
· Mumei

She left the third one without a name on purpose.
「In English, it’s Nameless…」

## Comment from the Illustrator

Let’s make Jeanne Alter’s swimsuit a swimsuit form that is cool for her! With that thought I designed her. I think it’s as if she agreed on this line without hesitation. The Noble Phantasm performance is wonderful too, but I personally like her Extra attack the most. Break all of you, I win. (Takeuchi Takashi)

## TL Notes

[1]: I don’t care I’m not supposed to take swimsuit Servants seriously, but this has to be the biggest middle finger to us ever.

[2]: A god after which clay dolls known as Shakōkidogū were said to be modeled. You’ll probably know about them if you’ve played SMT: P4. They have ties to the Ainu, so it's extremely hard to find much information unless you're an expert moon reader.
