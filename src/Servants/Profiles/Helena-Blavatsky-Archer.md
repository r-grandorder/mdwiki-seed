## Personal skills:



**Summer Vacation!: A+**

『Yes, yes. It’s no good if I don’t vent some stress from time to time!』

A skill acquired by Helena after deciding in her mind to play this summer too.

A variation of the original (Caster) Helena’s Mahatma skill.

The core of Helena being so active as an Archer.



**Nyarf!: B**

NYARF, a super water gun apparently made by Edison that can be freely manipulated.

By the existence of this skill, Helena’s Saint Graph was apparently defined as an Archer.

She herself says 『My class was supposed to be Rider……』.



**Colonel’s Summer Holiday: B**

The Olcott dolls will serve Helena even if in summer holidays.

For her who has become rather more active than usual, they’ll do their utmost to entertain her. The joy of summer holidays for them, Helena’s satisfaction, lies on that one point.

* Range: 1~50
* Maximum number of targets: 150 people





Sanat Kumara Wheel.

A new Noble Phantasm that Helena brought out with the class change.

A silver torus. It’s composed of the same material that the flying object that appears when releasing the Noble Phantasm’s True Name as a Caster, and has a different composition from any substance on Earth.

Countless flying objects appear with the True Name release, and pour beams over the surroundings like rain. Although a violent explosion occurs, they’ll never hit Helena directly.

## Personality



Her first premise to participate in the race is 『Let’s have fun!』.

Of course, since there’s nothing better than winning…… In a setting where she’s likely to win she’ll aim for a brilliant victory, that’s her policy.

But after all, she’s practically the same Helena that can’t be proactive.



## Attitude Towards Master



Doesn’t change much from usual.

But, when she lets her mind wander her granny side comes out.



## Dialogue Examples



『Helena Blavatsky, has brilliantly tried to change her Saint Graph! I can do it well if I try!』



『…… Perhaps, there’s a proper reason. This isn’t actually that easy to do.』



『Now that I can, I must have fun!』



『Nyarf! Fufu, this water gun is lots of fun! Very well!』



『Mahatma Change! And from there! The third light!』



## Character in FGO



A sudden clothing & class Mahatma Change!

With a new Noble Phantasm that borrows the power of the Demon Lord of Law Enforcement, the Kumara Wheel that she manifests for the race, Helena Blavatsky challenges the summer event!

With the cool water gun NYARF, she’ll eliminate the rivals lined up!

『By the way, NYARF’s production is mine!』

『I did the improvisations, you klutz!』



♢



Helena trying to wear a swimsuit.

The same person as the Caster Helena Blavatsky.



For her who was about to explode for several things, Edison and Tesla thought that 『venting stress』 was mandatory.

For that reason, she participates in the race (2017 summer event).

For that reason, she does as she pleases.

Helena decided to accept their concerns.

That is ―― in order to vent stress, she’s going to enjoy her summer vacation to her heart’s content!

**Nikola Tesla/Edison**

Now, let’s vent some stress!

Eh, what, Mister Edison? Nyarf? For me?

Hmm, but I don’t need a firearm, it’s dangerous…… Ah, a water gun? Very well, that’s fine!





**Mysterious Heroine X**

That’s a rocket……

You know, that thing Braun-kun from Germany aimed for. That thing to conquer the sea of stars, right?





**Nitocris**

Scarab––!

I like it! I like it, that thing. I want to ride it too!





**Fran/Babbage/Moriarty**

What’s that, it’s so cool! It looks incredibly fun!

Very well, we’ll make a special vehicle that is more fun and Mahatma-y!

Wait wait!





**Ishtar**

All told I had lots of fun. Fufu, thanks!





**El-Melloi II**

This time I want to hear about your disciples. I’m sure there were many funny children.

I must compete with Yeats-kun’s story.





**Medea**

I want to talk with you again. About things to study!





**Holmes**

…… Sigerson. You, you’ve angered me on purpose.

Don’t 『it’s good to relax from time to time』 me, geez!

But you’re right.

This isn’t so bad from time to time. Hmm, it was fun.



## Comment from the Illustrator



The concept of the design is “cosplay”. An old school swimsuit, science fiction style, military style, the aim was to make the swimsuits have a completely different direction with each Ascension. Including Nyarf and Kumara Wheel as materials was a very fun design work, but making a different and three-side drawing was extremely hard. (Matsuryū)
