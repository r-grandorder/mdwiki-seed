Nullifies Magecraft spells that are Rank A or below.

The Jaguar is whimsy. Even when one thinks that she can comprehend conversations, in reality, Jaguar Man often does not even understand them.

**Divinity: [A]**

A Skill where one has Divine Spirit aptitude.
Although she is purely a Divided Spirit, because the Jaguar is extremely compatible with possessed humans, Jaguar Man possesses this Skill at a high rank.

A divine protection bestowed by the Jaguar Divine Spirit. Jaguar Man does not feel fear nor pain. It is also a composite Skill that comprises the effects of the Valour Skill and the Intuition Skill.

**Jaguar Kick: [B]**

Formal Skill Name: Monstrous Strength
Jaguar Kick is also a destructive power. At any rate, Jaguar Man alone must survive no matter what it takes. A Skill that makes one feel such a strong determination and will.
Temporarily amplifies one’s strength. Primarily an offensive special characteristic possessed only by monsters and Mystical Beasts. Increases one’s Strength Parameter by one rank upon usage. The duration for this increase depends on the rank of “Monstrous Strength”.

**Jaguar Eye: [A+]**

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Great Death Claw: The Inescapable Claw of Death
- Rank: B
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~2
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

The “frightening club” held in Jaguar Man’s hand temporarily transforms into a gigantic size, before it smashes the target while it is accompanied with a raging force. Even without her knowing what is happening, the opponent is hardly able to evade the attack.

# Jaguar in the Black: The Dark Jungle where the Jaguar Lurks
- Rank: B
- Classification: Barrier Noble Phantasm
- Range: 0~20
- Maximum Number of Targets: 20 people

The Jaguar lurks in the forest of the night, waiting for its prey as it becomes darkness itself, and swoops down on its prey as it becomes the jaws of death itself. A Noble Phantasm that can only be used at night. Temporarily grants a plus modifier to Jaguar Man’s attack damage by exhibiting the Jaguar’s characteristic of being nocturnal. Simultaneously, she acquires a special “Presence Concealment” Skill and plus modifiers to her evasion and accuracy.

# Character

## Pronouns

First Person Pronouns: Jaguar / watashi / atashi
Second Person Pronouns: kimi / ○○-kun / ○○-chan
Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo / aitsu / yatsu


## Personality

Do you like a Jaguar elder sister? Whether you like her or not, Jaguar is Jaguar. There is no escape.

A friendly character, one who is bright and without discrimination. It likely seems to be a strong reflection of the possessed human’s personality. Once Jaguar Man’s mind becomes completely set on someone, the target will be certainly smothered with affection for weeks. That means there is no escape.

## Attitude Towards Master

The Jaguar Warrior is proud. One should not expect to earn her trust in a brief period of time, even if one is called the Master. However, if Jaguar Man notices one’s daily endeavours, what one will be able to receive is a Jaguar Stamp, stamped with her paw. If one collects a lot of stamps, someday, it will probably appear to result in one being able to receive an acknowledgement of being her close friend. One can do nothing but work hard towards becoming her Jaguar-mate (Tezcatlipoca-mate).

## Dialogue Examples

“The Jaguar Warrior has arrived at this place! I’m no tiger, so regarding that point, you better get that through your head!”

“Offer up a sacrifice to the cat. Reconcile with the cat.”

“Nyah!”

“The Jaguar knows all.”

“Now. Jaguar Stamps, how many have you accumeowulated?”

## Historical Character and Figure

One of the olden Divine Spirits transmitted in Central and South America. The Jaguar – namely, a symbol of “war” and “death” – is an existence revered for a long time in the Central and South American civilizations of all eras, and it is said that in the bygone days, it would often show its form to the world. In the Olmec Civilization of the Preclassic Period, the Jaguar Deity was a being who possesses the mixed-blood of a jaguar and a human, and it was deified in the shape of a “Jaguar-Human (Jaguar Man/Werejaguar)” figure and the like.

In Central and South American mythologies, the Jaguar is frequently spoken of as a spiritual existence called a Nagual, a shadow and a supernatural Guardian Spirit. It is said that Tezcatlipoca, one of the chief gods worshipped in Aztec Civilization, is also endowed with a Nagual, and this Nagual is a fearsome Jaguar Nagual.

## Character in FGO

In “Fate/Grand Order”, while Jaguar Man owns a nature as a Divine Spirit of old, it is simultaneously syncretizing its aspects as a Nagual of Tezcatlipoca, drawing them from its own genealogy.

Heroic Spirit Possession. The Jaguar Nagual achieved its materialization as a Divided Spirit, done by possessing a particular human as its vessel. From time immemorial, it is said that humans who obtained the Nagual of a Jaguar were endowed with supernatural powers. The Nagual tales are narrated even in modern times. Furthermore, concerning the criteria for possession, among the humans that has a tie to the Holy Grail, the person who carries the fate of the wildness and the wildest force is elected.

It is unknown why the Jaguar attempted to materialize in this world. Maybe it came along while being attracted to Quetzalcoatl, or maybe it came along while in a playful mood. Perhaps it stole a march on Tezcatlipoca when he was about to appear, and so on; this is an endlessly intriguing matter.

Because the Jaguar belongs to the lower grade among the Divine Spirit Servants, its selling point is that it does not cost a lot to cover in terms of Magical Energy.

No matter how one looks at it, the personality of the possessed body is the main host, but that should not be pointed out.

## Standard Weapons

A frightening club. Used for close-range attacks.

## Others

The alignment belongs to Jaguar Man, not the possessed human. The gender belongs to the possessed human.

The possessed human is endowed with an astounding Luck rank, but it was ranked down for some reason at the time of possession.

## Comment from the Illustrator

‘When talking about Jaguar Man, isn’t it a given to have her get on a motorcycle?! What do I do?!’ And this is the result of having racked my brains over it. Is it ok for me to make a completely different pose for her Final Ascension Stage!? I’m thankful! And one thing! I’m happy that it can be accepted and used. There was certainly a great pressure on me while drawing her. (Aotsuki Takao)
