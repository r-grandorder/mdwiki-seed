## Personal Skills

**Knight of the Lake: [A]**

He was raised from infancy by the Lady of the Lake. Due to that, he is constantly affected by her blessing.
Using this skill, he is able to temporarily add a + to any parameter other than LCK (substantially doubling it).

**Eternal Arms Mastery: [A+]**

A martial skill that reach the status where one can boast of being peerless in an apparent age.
By means of perfect unification of the mind, technique, and body, even when affected any sorts of influence of mental restriction he is capable of demonstrating perfect combat capability.

**A Knight Does Not Die with Empty Hands: [A+]**

Knight of Owner
Normally a Noble Phantasm instead of a skill. An ability Noble Phantasm that grants the attribute to everything he holds "his Noble Phantasm". Be it an iron pole or an aircraft fighter, it will be treated as a D rank Noble Phantasm.

(NP version has A++. important?)

**Protection of the Spirit: [A]**

The ability to call upon preferential luck in a critical situation means of blessing from a spirit. Activation is only possible in the battlefield, performing feats of arms.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Arondight - Unfading Light of the Lake
- Rank: A
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~2
- Maximum target: 1 person

Arondight.
The moment he draw out this sword, his whole parameter is increased by 1 rank.
Furthermore, due to the anecdote of dragon extermination, it deals additional damage against Heroic Spirit with dragonic attribute.

(the one the berserker version has is A++, and the saber version loss the saving throw success rate double. important?)

# Arondight Overload - Breaking All Restraint・Overflowing Light of the Lake
- Rank: A
- Type: Anti-Unit/Anti-Army Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~50
- Maximum target: 500 person

Arondight Overload.
Bestowing an overload to the Unfading Light of the Lake, then unleashing the loaded magic energy in the sword's blade.
Transforming it as an attack. Due to the usage method being different from how it is originally, it puts intense burden on Lancelot's body.
In FateGO it is used against a single enemy, but originally it is a Noble Phantasm used against enemy's troop.

(ingame version has it as "repurposing as an attack" instead of "transforming it as an attack". important?)
(lines from ingame menu has this:
本来であれば光の斬撃となる魔力をあえて放出せず、対象を斬りつけた際に解放する剣技に寄った 宝具。
膨大な魔力は切断面から溢れ、その青い光はまさに湖のようだと称された。
So with Arondight Overload having max 50 range and 500 target, practically identical with Balmung sword beam, presumably the original use is still bestowing an overloading on Arondight but doesnt intentionally reining it in, which is the anti-army part, while the anti-unit part is releasing it when the slash hits the target)

# Character

## Pronouns

First pronoun: watashi
Second pronoun: anata/kisama/shokun
Third pronoun: kare/kanojo

## Personality

He loves justice, respects woman, and detests evil. He is fond of righteous path, unforgiving towards cowardly behavior, and always behaves in pride---------the perfect existence that embodied the way of the knights.
However, that pure nobility and too serious of a dignity of his easily invites misunderstanding and envy.
Heroes possess both sides of light and shadow aspects within them, but Lancelot can be said to consist only of the side of light.

## Attitude Towards Master

As he is a noble and upright knight, as a Servant he can be said to be the exactly ideal existence. However, he never personally involves himself deeply in regards of servant-master relationship. Therefore, one can feel annoyance towards his behavior that serves while drawing a line.

## Dialogue Examples

"Of the Round Table, assault knight Lancelot.
In the name of the king, I shall restraint the enemy.
Resist, and I shall show no mercy.
You may submit, or you may oppose-----do as your conviction demands you."

"I simply wish, for my king to judge the lawbreaker that I am.
If I may have one wish towards the Holy Grail, that that is my wish."

"Nay....
It simply that I have spotted a beautiful lady in far in the distance, and thus I promptly..."

## Historical Character and Figure

In the legend of King Arthur, he is the greatest and most commended knight within the Round Table.
His competency with surpass even King Arthur himself, and there was even his feat of one-on-one fight against Gawain, who demonstrates threefold of power during daylight, where Lancelot continuously fought for several hours.
Competent and popular, he is one of the most preeminent figure of the Round Table.

However, his immoral love with Guinevere, King Arthur's queen, the secret of King Arthur's birth, and him having no choice but to turn his sword against those he once deemed friends; all manners of tragic fate had brought doom upon him.

## Character in FGO

The type of Lancelot that is perhaps closest to how he was during his life. An ideal knight. To say that he is the strongest knight among the Round Table would be no sophistication.
He is able to hold conversation with Gawain, Tristan, or Bedivere no differently than when he was alive, but to his regret, when it comes to Mordred, he saw her bare face for the first time and ended up hesitating to talk to her.

It's the similar situation in relation with Mashu Kyrielight, but with her, it's better to say that he ended up gazing affectionately towards the spirit foundation existing deep within her.

## Related Characters

**Artoria**

'Tis an honor.
This time, I am not mistaken; this be the place I shall offer my sword.

**Mashu**

We should have neither bond nor a connection, yet I feel one as such.
I see. It do seem that he had done his duty magnificently.
For now, I shall simply, quietly take pride in it.

**Gawain**

Naturally, an intimate friend of mine.
I am truly glad for another chance to once again fight side by side with him.... However. While that may be the case. No matter how many times we do battle, I shall certainly be the one to emerge victorious. Indeed.

**Tristan**

.....Very well, Sir Tristan! Let us put that matter for another place!
In the dining room and the hallways, let us speak nothing but heroic tales!

**Mordred**

Wait, wait.
I... I am putting my thoughts in order, so...

## Comment from the Illustrator

It came up in previous discussions where the white armor version of Zero Lancelot takes off his helmet and shows us his long hair during second ascension; when he gets to that form I wanted to draw a rough design, but then I was told to do him "with a feeling of a yankee who repents and cut off his hair". So I had the various design, his armor, and his hair taken out, and the result settled down to his current form. Please stay as a father who will never raise his head to his daughter. (Shimadrill)
