## Class Skills

**Presence Concealment: [B]**

A Skill that suppresses one’s presence as a Servant. It is suitable for espionage activities. If one suppresses their presence completely, it is extremely difficult for them to be detected. However, the rank of Presence Concealment drops greatly when they are preparing to attack.

## Personal Skills

**Suppression: [A]**

An assassin’s secret art that will absolutely not let one’s bloodlust come out to the surface until the moment just before the attack. If it at least reaches Rank A, others would be unable to surmise the presence of one’s bloodlust until the instant they grasp a weapon in their hand.

**Planning: [B]**

Tactical thinking done up to assassinating a target. Unlike Military Tactics, this is constricted to only assassination missions in which few people are involved.

Furthermore, having Jing Ke herself return alive is not taken into account.

**As if No One is Nearby: [A]**

The creator of this idiom, which is generally still used even in the present. Although Jing Ke drinks alcohol often with her friend Gao Jianli, she would frequently become too intoxicated and start to act violently, bawl out, and become indignant, so that kind of state was lamented as something like her acting “as if no one is nearby” to watch her be like this.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Just Only for Killing: The Non-Returnable Dagger

- Rank: B
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

The dagger prepared for the assassination of Shi Huangdi. According to an anecdote, it was said to be enveloped and hidden within a map scroll, so it extraordinarily excels in the aspect of concealment. The poison on the blade can even cause instant death with just about a scratch, but those who have anecdotes of being poison-proof will carry out an advantageous check against that.

However, such an aspect is not the true value of this Noble Phantasm. Using this dagger is something that shows the resolution of “one who is never to return from their mission.” Therefore, Jing Ke accepts her death when using this Noble Phantasm, choosing to use all her strength to carry out the assassination. Based on the matter of executing the mission on the premise of one who is never to return from their mission, it is an assassination Noble Phantasm that is extremely difficult to avoid.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First Person Pronoun: watashi
- Second Person Pronouns: kiden / kimi, etc.
- Third Person Pronouns: kare / kanojo

## Personality

A drinker with a heroic disposition that is clear-cut and straightforward. Jing Ke speaks with the verbal expression of a man’s, but when alcohol goes into her, she partially returns to her original root as a woman. Although she desires a calm daily life, if it is for the sake of righteousness, she will not even spare herself of death. Even if she draws closer to death, she has the boldness to laugh and look good in doing so. If there is a girls-only gathering within Chaldea, there is a high probability that she will be participating in it for some reason. Perhaps an unreserved character is liked by the women groups.

## Attitude Towards Master

Fundamentally, as long as nothing runs counter to “righteousness”, which is her personal creed, Jing Ke will serve with devotion. On the contrary, if it is because she is an Assassin that at an occasion, she has gotten involved in an evil act by her Master, even an individual that is virtuous to some degree will have to be anxious about her betrayal.

## Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Assassin. I’ve called on you, responding to your summons. Although I’m a fool who couldn’t even accomplish my duty, I’m prepared to freely make use of this body.”

“————Being alive in a fatal situation. Unless I become desperate, I can’t even catch a hold of my life.”

“Alcohol isn’t something to get drunk with. It’s something for one to merely float a short distance away from this world.”

“… You, you’re good. Yeah. You’re really good.”

## Historical Character and Figure

Jing Ke is an assassin who was hired by Dan, the Crown Prince of the Yan State, with the objective of assassinating Qin Shi Huangdi. She views that roistering in alcohol together with friends is a supreme joy, but on the other hand, she has tastes in reading and swordsmanship, and she also likes talking with wise men.

Dan, the Crown Prince of Yan, was anxious about the Qin State, whose power still continues to grow day after day, and his resentment towards them became stronger after he received a heartless treatment at the time when he consented to being a hostage for Qin, so he was finally determined in carrying out the assassination of Qin Shi Huangdi. Dan sought advice for the assassination from Tian Guang, a wise man so well known, there was no person in Yan who does not know of him. Tian Guang recommended Jing Ke for the assassination, but because of Dan’s careless words, he completely gave up his life after recommending Jing Ke.

Jing Ke was moved by the trust made with Tian Guang’s life, so she accepted the assassination mission of Shi Huangdi. A plan was polished where she has an audience with Shi Huangdi by presenting the head of a general who was escaping from Qin and a map of Yan, but an assistant who will take that same life with Jing Ke was necessary for this mission.

Jing Ke was thinking about bringing along a friend who can be trusted, but within the passage of time, Dan begins to question that maybe, Jing Ke was under fear. Reluctantly, Jing Ke decided to take a young man named Qin Wuyang, who was recommended by Dan. Qin Wuyang murdered a man at the age of 13, and was professing to be————‘a great man where there is not even a person who can compare with his experience nowadays at the age of 19’, but Jing Ke recognizes that he is a coward.

Although the audience with Shi Huangdi was going smoothly, just as she thought, Qin Wuyang was shivering and could not even take one movement forward, so Jing Ke unavoidably attempted a solo assassination. However, plenty of misfortunes overlapped with each other, and Jing Ke’s one attack had not reached Shi Huangdi. Furthermore, it was also reported that Qin Wuyang was killed by being trampled upon during a riot at this time as he fled. At the verge of death, Jing Ke laughed and sneered that “If I wanted to kill you, I could’ve done so, but it was my objective to take you as a hostage. Unfortunate, so unfortunate.” It is said that she was cut up into pieces by Shi Huangdi’s retainers. In addition, Jing Ke left behind one song at the time of her departure from Yan:

“The wind blows, the river freezes. The hero fords, never to return!”

… Jing Ke was already prepared in that she would not return alive, and it is said that when she sang this verse at that time, every person seeing her off started shedding tears.

In future years, Gao Jianli, who was Jing Ke’s friend, attempted the assassination of Shi Huangdi too, but that likewise ended in failure.

## Comment from the Illustrator

Although I made a design that placed an emphasis on her thigh which daringly reveals her legs as she has an anecdote where her thigh was slashed by Shi Huangdi, due to the battle scenes, I happen to get the feeling that Jing Ke seems terribly cold in the snowy mountains and the like, so I felt a little pitiful for her as a result. There is a mask she owns with a sense of respect as I feel like if one says the word ‘Assassin’, I think of a mask, but I got instructions saying “Do not put it on her face, alright?” On her battle sprite, it was cute to give her a pat on the head.
