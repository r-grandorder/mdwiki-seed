## Class Skills

**Magical Resistance: [B]**

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done with a chant of three verses or below. One practically does not suffer damage from Magecraft even if it was a Great Magecraft or Ritual Spell.

**Riding: [A]**

Artoria can freely handle all vehicles and beasts except Divine Beasts and Dragon Kins.[1]

## Personal Skills

**Magical Burst: [A]**

A Skill that temporarily strengthens oneself by infusing their body and weapons with their Magical Energy. Although it is possible to tremendously raise one’s physical abilities, Magical Energy consumption is not very efficient.

**Charisma: [B]**

The natural talent to command an army.
Artoria – who ruled over Britain even while it was exposed to foreign enemies, and having entirely repelled those enemies – possesses a high charisma.

**Blessings from the Ends of the World: [A]***

Artoria, who possesses the Holy Lance that exists as an anchor to the planet, is receiving divine protection from the Farthest Ends itself.

*The Blessings from the Ends of the World Skill is EX-rank in the game

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Invisible Air: The Wind King’s Barrier
- Rank: C
- Classification: Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~2
- Maximum Number of Targets: 1 person

When Artoria materializes as a Saber, this Noble Phantasm was something that conceals her sword, but when she materializes as a Lancer, it is treated as nothing more than a “Wind Noble Phantasm”.

# Rhongomyniad: The Lance that Shines to the Ends of the World
- Rank: A++
- Classification: Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1~99
- Maximum Number of Targets: 900 people

The Holy Lance. An anchor of storm that fastens the planet together. It is a Deity-Made Armament. Its true form is said to be a tower that fastens the surface of the World onto the planet. At the time of its True Name Release, its rank and classification changes. It is the pillar at the Farthest Ends, shining and filled with the brilliance of the planet, even when its original power is still restricted according to the Thirteen Restraints————

The “pillar of light” that fastens the outer layer of the World onto the planet is viewed as the main body of the Holy Lance Rhongomyniad. It is because of the existence of the Thirteen Restraints, which are endowed with the same process as the “Sacred Sword of the Planet that saves the world”, that it is barely in a state where it can succeed in taking form as a Noble Phantasm.

## Personality

King Arthur, the legendary Knight King who governed over Britain. A what-if King Arthur who, after emerging as a king, made the Holy Lance his main armament instead of the Sacred Sword and reigned over Britain. Although she has the same appearance as the “Knight King” – aka “Goddess Rhongomyniad” – who reigned over the Holy City and had acted for the sake of leaving as many humans behind in the aftermath as the majority while the height of the great undertaking, the Human Order Incineration, was looming, she is essentially a different person.

Having lost her growth suspension caused by the Sacred Sword, Artoria grew to a physical age suitable for a king. She became an existence closer to a Divine Spirit because she is using the Holy Lance, but given that her usage period of the lance was merely about a decade, her mental/spiritual make-up has not changed in a big way. However, her body has changed in a big way.


## Attitude Towards Master

Artoria, who was summoned to Chaldea as a Servant, knows the beauty of the world. She will certainly fight together with the Master and wield all the power that she is able to hold, all for the sake of taking back the world that shines even if it is not at the Farthest Ends.


## Character in FGO

A Heroic Spirit of a “different possibility” that branched from the normal Artoria. Although she has the form of a human, this version of Artoria Pendragon can no longer be called a Heroic Spirit of the Man Attribute. Due to the properties hidden within the Holy Lance, she has changed/altered into an existence close to that of a Divine Spirit – a goddess if anything. While she has become more rational, and moreover, more composed than the Artoria of the Sacred Sword, her human nature has not been parted with. Rather, there exists placidity in the choices she makes in proportion to how much she has grown into an adult, attaining the ideal way a King ought to be.

This version of Artoria is a Heroic Spirit of the Heaven Attribute that personally returned her Holy Lance at Camlann Hill, before she returned to the earth. However, the Servant “Lion King”, who has the same appearance as her, was not able to die when she was fated to die, and as a result, she became a wandering ghost while keeping onto the Holy Lance. Because the “Lion King” held onto the Holy Lance and transformed into “Goddess Rhongomyniad”, completely changing into a Divine Spirit in the process, this version of Artoria is different in the inside compared to the "Lion King".

## Others

There are various opinions about Artoria’s physique as her body weight is not listed when she is a Lancer. Also, when she is a Lancer, she is always mounted on a horse. This time, her steed is her horse “Dun Stallion”.

## Related Characters

**Artoria Pendragon (Lily)**

“Charming. So that too… is one of the what-ifs of the me in history, huh?”

**Artoria Pendragon**

“The things that person was burdened with were equal to all of mine, were they not? I see. No, I feel like it is even less pitiful than what I had thought I would feel, you know. Instead, pride is welling up inside this chest. Since doing things like… patting her head would, as one would expect, be too impolite of me, I wonder if she would be willing to drink something like alcohol together with me instead?”

**Artoria Pendragon (Lancer Alter)**

“The King of the Storm? The Wild Hunt, huh? I see, so it is like that.”

**Knights of the Round Table**

“I am glad that they seem to be in good health. It is good to take an occasional breather too, but… do not overdo everything, alright? Everything in moderation.”

**Mordred**

(No reaction)

**Merlin**

“Do not overdo it.”

**Gilgamesh / Ozymandias**

“Do not overdo it!”

**Romulus**

“Um, what is the expression? Ah, yes, it would be nice if you ‘Rome’ in moderation as well… Anyway, I give you my gratitude.”

**Bedivere**

“Do not look after me constantly, at least not this much. You yourself materialized as a Servant of Chaldea’s Master. You should live freely, even more so in this time as such… Do not cry, Bedivere. Raise your face. I am not the one that you know, and also, you are not the Bedivere that I know, but those tears… they really pierce into my chest.”

## Comment from the Illustrator

As for Lancer Artoria’s design, her design was settled ahead of Alter’s despite being released later. I felt like I kept in mind of an impression that Saber Artoria had legitimately evolved as I drew her. Afterwards, when the time came where it became necessary for a separate design for her role as the Lion King in Chapter 6, it resulted in us proceeding with a combination of all her Ascension states. As one would expect, if her breasts in her Final Ascension were exposed during Chapter 6: Camelot, it would have totally ruined the whole Holy Selection moment, right? (Ishida Akira)

## TL Notes

[1] – Just noting that A-rank Riding is usually not high-ranked enough for one to be able to ride Phantasmal Beasts, but it seems Artoria can do so since the description doesn’t mention her being unable to ride phantasmal-ranked beasts.
