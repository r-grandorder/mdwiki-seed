## Class Skills

**Tool Creation (Fake): [A]**

Creation of tools tinged with magic energy.
Gilgamesh, who is originally not a magus, does not possess this Skill. However, by means of the existence of his Noble Phantasm he gained an ability equal to it. The created (taken out from his Noble Phantasm) tools are all "treasures from within the vault of Babylon."
By using this Skill, he is able to make use of various magic tools and miracle drugs.

**Territory Creation: [A]**

Not only can he produce tools as a magus, he is even able to manufacture constructions. To begin with, the stronghold of Uruk was by Gilgamesh's design. Due to the limit of stone and clay constructions, "I need more lumbers. I suppose it would not do to not visit the cedar forest...."
he muttered.
The king wished not to go to the cedar forest, where one matter regarding Enkidu left its traces there.

**Divinity: [B] ([A+])**

Originally he possesses the highest Divinity rank of A+, but due to him not harboring any good impression in regards of the gods, the rank declines.

## Personal Skills

**Golden Rule: [A]**

The wise king who had returned from his journey for immortality, growing as a king.
Increases star generation value to all allies.

(TL note: description obviously should have been for King's Return. I guess this skills represents the state of mind and revelation and what not as a sage king, like the whole episode told in CCC turned as a skill.)

**Charisma: [A+]**

The charisma of Gilgamesh, most excelling of kings, as that of a wise king. He possesses an exceedingly powerful charismatic nature, already akin to that of a charm or a curse.

**Ruler of Magic Wands: [EX]**

A skill that denotes Gilgamesh's way of being as a Caster who manipulates a diverse amount of magic mystic code. Grants bonus to attacks of magical type.
He takes tender care of his tools should he fight while being mindful to them. Such a king he was.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Gate of Babylon - King's Treasure
- Rank: E-A++
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: -
- Maximum target: -

Gate of Babylon.
Fundamentally the same Noble Phantasm he possesses as an Archer.
By connecting the space around him with Babylon, he pulls out an innumerable amount of magic wands and mystic code and utilize magic. In the magic wands and mystic codes, the great thaumathurgy of the age of the gods is loaded. Due to the display of effects and invocation that mostly does not consume the user's magic energy, it is a Noble Phantasm that excels in its extraordinary cost performance.
Utilized in normal attacks, its True Name release is not utilized in FateGO.

# Melam Dingir - King's Signal Gun
- Rank: B
- Type: Anti-Army/Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm
- Range: 99
- Maximum target: 700 person

Melam Dingir.
Long distance raid bombing from the stronghold of Uruk. An amazing bombardment that concentrates the total force of not only the wise king Gilgamesh, but also the people of Uruk who lived in the age of the gods. In FateGO, it possesses the effect of raising allies defensive power after attacking all the opponents.

Gilgamesh with great sorrow loads the catapults with his personal collection, then leaves it at the hands of the soldiers.
"Broken Phantasm? I did that already more than 4000 years ago!"

(TL note: Melam Dingir's name presumably comes from melam (melammu in akkadian), a concept of ancient Mesopotamian divinity, which is a "mantle of radiance" type of blazing light that is worn like a garment depicted like a light aura that surrounds a deity or demon, and dingir which is simply Sumerian words for god, used to denote religious names and related concepts. So literally Godly Divine Radiance? I dunno how SUmer grammar works. But weird choice of name, considering Gil denounces the gods.
So looking back at Babylonia


Dingir was used as a furigana for 神権印章, lit. Seal of Divine Right (not lock seal, more like stamp sort of seal) when describing the canon itself
which is also the name of that clay tablet thing CasGil have
its also count as one of the King's Treasure too. THe canons, i mean.


Merlin also said further that "Dingir" denotes deification.
Deification is by merit. A god did not become a god by being approved by a god, but by man. Faith of humanity makes of the gods.


Gil called his cannons Dingir as a way to say that if deification comes from humanity, than using this Dingir canons to protect Uruk signifies that humanity would be the source of what protects humanity itself.
Also this is another of Gil's selfnamed NP.

Also we still don't know whether this is an RM like NPs that summons even the citizens of Uruk for sure, damn this ambiguity. Im leaning towards yes tho.)

# Sha Naqba Imuru - Omniscient Omnipotent Star
- Rank: EX
- Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
- Range: -
- Maximum target: 1 person

Sha Naqba Imuru.
Spreading through the corners of the earth just like the radiance of a star, he sees through everything; the oldest of heroes, the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh. This is his spirituality, turned into a Noble Phantasm.
He sees through be it the enemy's True Name or Noble Phantasm, or even the truth concealed in multiple layers by simply a glance.
Normally a continuously active Noble Phantasm, but in FateGO its True Name release is not performed.

(Tlnote: I dunno if people know of this already but anyway, Sha Naqba Imuru is an incipit that actually is written in the Epic of Gilgamesh, meaning "He who Saw the Deep", or in modern terms: "He who Sees the Unknown". Cool stuffs, legitimate NPs like these are.)

# Character

## Pronouns

First pronoun: ware (ore)
Second pronoun: kisama/omae/zasshu/**(without honorifics)
Third pronoun: kisamara/omaetachi/zasshu/**(without honorifics)

## Personality

The supreme wise king who had returned from his journey for immortality.
He is told of as "he who sees everything" in the legend.
At times ruthless, a times approves of humanity; the great king of Uruk that sternly guides of the people.
That state of being is different from how he is as an Archer. He is not the hero who embodies malevolent force, but the wise king that supervises of the people.

"Fuhahaha, it is an obvious thing if you just look at my alignment! Most penance and ordeals I can overcome, but death form overwork is the one thing I never want to experience again!"

He guards his back more compared when he is as the king of heroes, and so his meagerness during battle has increased.

## Attitude Towards Master

As a matter of fact, his attitude towards the Master does not appear to be much different from that as an Archer, but...
There is a majority opinion among the staff members of Chaldea that that manifesting figure of his is not a severe one towards the Master.

## Dialogue Examples

"This is not a response to your summon. Do not get attached to me, mongrel."

"I am busy. Do not take up more of my time."

"Every treasures in this world belongs to me. It is exactly due to that that I can even manifest as a Caster."

"To bind myself with using only magic is, too, the king's magnamity."

"Rejoice, mongrel! And disappear!"

## Character in FGO

Mankind's oldest hero, the King of Heroes Gilgamesh.
Why does he manifest as a Caster?
Pulling out countless numbers of magic wands from his Noble Phantasm "King's Treasure" and unleashing various form of attacks; that figure of his certainly appears like that of a magus, but in practice it is far different from a magus who compiles magic reaching towards the mystery of the world. He is also quite different from the author type of Casters that writes of words that composes into poems or novels and fold into a book their very own worlds-----
That figure of his, is so to speak a magus (Caster) in shape only.

There was an opinion left in the Chaldea leftover unofficial records:
"I think that's probably just his own insinuation. You can call it a sneer. He understands. What the true nature of the magic king who advanced the incineration of Human Order is. ....No, not just the magic king. I'm sure he...."

(the sentence above uses boku as first pronoun, and im like 99% sure this is Roman speaking)

## Standard Weapons

Taking out the magic wands throughout the space by means of the Noble Phantasm "King's Treasure" and projecting magic from their points. Long ranged attacks.

Such an extravagant performance and pampering is fine, but sometimes you need to save up!
Know that only my treasure vault holds infinite wealth!
...No, I am not saying it is fine to count on my vault instead.

Hmph.

**Enkidu**

You always keep on telling me take a rest, but...
Well, I suppose it is fine now and then. ------Wait wait, there are no polar bears in the South Pole!

......................Good grief.

## Comment from the Illustrator

I heard of the request to do a Caster Class of Gilgamesh, and because I went completely nervous about it, they gave me many hints like "arabesque" "sex appeal" "beautiful body" "sorcerer". Although there are some slightly suspicious ones, the golden naked magus is finished. (Ginka)
