## Class Skills

**Territory Creation: [B]**

Makes up a favorable encampment for oneself as a mage.

It is possible to build a “hospital” as a healing magus.

**Item Construction: [B]**

Can create instruments carrying mana.

What can be produced is mainly potions for therapeutic usage.

## Personal Skills

**High-Speed Divine Words: [A]**

Allows to perform magecraft without a summoning/activating the Magic Circuits.

Can launch even High-Thaumaturgy in one stage (Single Action).

**Poison Resistance: [A]**

The excellent healing mage, Medea, can naturally invalidate any poison.

At the same time she heals the surrounding’s poison, she recovers stamina.

**Romance of Foam: [B]**

That was a fragile love like a bubble, wasn’t it?

The whispered intimacies were hollow words, weren’t they?

But, what’s wrong with that?

Even if those whispers weren’t true, even if everything was a lie,

until the burst with a needle prick ――― certainly, it’s love.

## Noble Phantasm(s)

# Pain Breaker - All flaws will be repaired

- Rank: C
- Type: Anti-Thaumaturgy Noble Phantasm
- Range: 1
- Rank: 1 person

Pain Breaker.

A healing Noble Phantasm that is paired up with the 『All talismans must be destroyed (Rule Breaker)』 that the original Caster Medea uses. If Medea’s Noble Phantasm is an embodiment of the legend of betrayal, Medea Lily’s Noble Phantasm could be said to be an embodiment of love.

Any curse and injury will be returned to zero through magecraft. It’s not time manipulation, but auto-repairing by calculating the appearance that should be, but for those who don’t know it’ll look like time rewinding.

Any unreasonableness except for “death” can be overcome, but the dead alone can’t be recovered.

# Character

## Pronouns

- First person pronoun: わたし (watashi)
- Second person pronoun: あなた (anata) (although it’s written アナタ in her dialogues)

## Personality

A young lady separated from the world of grief and worry. She has been summoned in the form just before being ensnared by Jason, her loveliness will not allow others to come level with her.

Since she’s seriously aware of not knowing about the world, there’s a mixture of feelings of wanting to do something and resignation for being helpless.

On the other hand, she understands her own gruesome ending.

Good-natured and easy to trust people in her innocence ――― If turned the other way, that also means that she’s full of distrust towards humans.

It’s not that she trusts, but that she wants to trust.

## Attitude Towards Master

The fundamentally good Medea Lily will serve her Master.

Also, since there’s no motive to wager the Holy Grail, basically it will be possible to build a gentle master-servant relationship.

However, she also draws a line like other equal Servant.

Attachment is attachment, but she’ll be in a state of negligence as long as the Master doesn’t give the step.

In the case of a Master that truly cares about her, her likability will rise more and more.

## Dialogue Examples

『…… I don’t like fighting, but I’ll do what I must do!』

『I-I wonder if it’s fine for me to be so blissful……
No, it’s not time to grow timid! In order to end your battle safely, let me do my best, Master!』

『I’ve changed since I met you.
The me that was scared of the outside world isn’t here anymore. Now I will wield this staff for the sake of your advancing future and the world you live in.
…… Thank you, my Master. I’ll pray for being able to stay to your side until the end.』

## Historical Character and Figure

Medea was the daughter of king Aeëtes, a princess that was taught magecraft by the moon goddess Hecate.

For her at those times, the world was beautiful, and something such as living itself being painful was a faraway and distant event.

A vague presentiment, that she’ll be married to someone that will be necessary for the country in the near future. There was no love or affection, only an obligation as royalty.


――― There wasn’t the knowledge to feel dissatisfaction about that, nor the feeling.


Even if Medea knew that love and affection existed, she didn’t know that they maddened people.

By the wiles of the gods, Medea fell in love with Jason. Her cheeks blushed and her chest throbbed. She thought that this man she had just met was more important than anyone of her family.

It wasn’t something manifested from her own heart ――― however, she was manipulated.

That was her first love for her.

…… If we assume there’s one tragedy.

For Jason, Medea was just a necessary capable person for him to become king but not a partner whom he fell in love with.

That’s why, when Medea killed her younger brother without hesitation for Jason’s sake, he became deeply frightened.

Considering it calmly, everything Medea did was for Jason, but Jason didn’t love Medea enough for him to believe that.

## Character in FGO

She’s fixed on the state of when, after finishing a boat trip, Jason declared “damned witch, I don’t love you”.

A lady sheltered from the world that, while certainly grasping Jason’s circumstances and her own state, she blinks in surprise and tilts her head with a『But why did it turn this way?』 towards her own fate.

Since she still has to experience becoming the Witch of Betrayal, Medea Lily doesn’t know the pain of treason yet.

She’s just a little girl that, in order to not bring shame to the names of her ancestor the goddess Hecate and her teacher the witch Circe, tries to believe in the bonds of people as a good witch.

**Jason**

No, I know. That someday, you’ll betray me. That you’ll abandon me. That you don’t love me.


**Medea**

Why does the adult me like purple so much?


## Comment from the Illustrator

The surprising manifestation of a non-loli ver. I individually drew at first in the materials thinking it was a joke (lol). A parallel different existence from the short-haired Medea in hollow, I’m told. She’s the first one I started drawing individually for the FateGO pictures, so I fumbled with all kind of things.

For some reason I misunderstood that the sprites would be 3D models and raised the small details more than necessary. She was intently designed as lovely, but the way she’s distorted in the work makes a wonderful contrast. (Koyama Hirokazu)
