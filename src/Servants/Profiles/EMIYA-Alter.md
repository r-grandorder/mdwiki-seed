## Class Skills



**Magic Resistance: D**

Invalidates single action magic usage.



**Independent Action: A**

The ability to be able to act independently for a period even if magic energy supply from the Master is severed.

In cases where vast quantity of magic energy is needed, such as during usage of Noble Phantasm, backup from the Master is necessary.



## Personal Skills



**Bulletproof Treatment: A**

A Skill that may very well be called “Protection from Arrows” by means of the most modern [1] Heroic Spirit.

It’s designated as bulletproof, but strictly speaking most projectiles can be repelled.



**Projection Magic: C (conditionally A+)**

A magic that reproduces tools by his image for but several minutes.

The pair of swords that Archer favored, Kanshou and Bakuya, was something created by means of projection magic as well.

Its rank rapidly increases only when the projection subject is categorized as “sword”.

Through the special trait of “able to prepare counterfeits many times over”, Emiya momentarily increases the power of the projected Noble Phantasms by making them crash and detonates.



**Derisive Mind of Steel: A**

A Mental Pollution Skill granted upon being inverted.

Unlike Mental Pollution, it is able to force in the designated concept; close to a kind of brainwashing.

The thought bestowed to him makes the protection of Human Order the priority; deeming the way of Guardians which forsakes everything other than that to be acceptable.

Were this man not endowed with A-rank, he would not have been able to sufficiently exhibits the power of his inversion status.



# TL's Note

[1] 最新: newest, latest; i opted with most modern because using newest or latest makes me imagine iPhone release instead



## Noble Phantasm(s)



# Unlimited Lost Works: Infinite Swords Creation



* Rank: E~A
* Type: Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm
* Range: 30-60
* Max. Targets: ? unit



Unlimited Lost Works.

The “Infinite Swords Creation” is one of the furthest land that the magic specialized in forging swords had staked a life time to arrive at.

This reality marble accumulates within it all the weapons bearing the concept of “swords” that he had seen.

...However, this man’s “Infinite Swords Creation” arises from within the body of the opponent. The minuscule Reality Marble becomes a dreadful force within their body and rips the enemy apart.



# Character



## Pronouns



* First Person: Ore
* Second Person: Anta
* Third Person: Kare/kanojo/sore



## Personality



The ally of justice who had fallen to ruins.

At the beginning, he had been a sweeper who acts under a coldheaded theory and law. However, by means of several incidents, he transforms into a satirist to the point of self-injury.

He chooses mission that must be done composedly and heartlessly, and deals with it rationally.

Even now, his recollection and ego are whittling away bit by bit; due to that, his mundane memories are poor.

It seems that he puts to his diary only things that he judges to must be recorded.



## Attitude Towards Master



He holds absolutely no expectation towards the Master.

The man who speaks cynically of himself as a machine would gladly do anything, no matter how fiendish, if it’s for the sake of achieving his objective.

And of course, should avoiding fiendish method and even with a roundabout way the objective gets done, he would not stop that either.



## Dialogue Examples



* “Here for revenge? Not bad. That’s a befitting last days.”

* “...Did you say something, Master? Apologies, lately I’ve had some dizzy attacks…. Even a conversation that happens just five minutes ago felt like a distant dream.”

* “It’s time? Very well. Let’s go, Master. I know. We’re doing the usual; saving the weak and crushing the strong, no? Being an ally of justice isn’t bad. -I don’t know why. But for some reason I feel like weeping.”

* “So. The swan had thus flew away. Avarice brings only harm. Such a frame and body would be able to neither flutter nor float away. It shall sink like the metal it is.”



## Historical Character and Figure



He is not the nameless that the society brought forth, but a ruined, mindless enforcer[1] who threw away his own name.

His memory is damaged, and he had already lost his past.

The man continues to deride himself, who had forsaken morality, despised love, and became nothing but a living corpse.



He has no ideals, no beliefs; and thus he is efficient.

Boasting of being just like a machine, a nameless antihero.

Due to parts of his roots being corrupted, he will unfold a slaughter without mercy if it’s for the sake of accomplishing his objective.



# TL's Note

[1] 執行者. Can also mean executioner/performer. Literally the one who does stuffs.



## Standard Weapons



He utilizes two guns; a two sword style by means of the pair of guns “Kanshou and Bakuya”.



## Related Characters



**Emiya**

My past self, who put a bitter smile as if saying he can’t put a complain even if killed.[1]



**Sesshouin Kiara**

I don’t have much of an opinion in matters and affairs regarding this woman.

I will simply kill her, no matter how many times, if her way of being propagates through society and brings harm to it.



**Jaguar Man**

…..You, and that boy…. I…..



# TL's Note

[1] with how japanese works this is ambigue af. I cant say who is being killed in this sentence, emiya or emiya, although the answer is obviously emiya.



## Comment from the Illustrator



Emiya who is very much out of the usual… I’ve drawn him in high spirit with who knows how many words that came out during the exchange with Type-MOON, strengthening the image of “Emiya who upon further thinking looks like a prisoner!” Afterwards, his voice, his meager setting development, as well as his story began to take form, becoming a character; his role nimbly jumps over my image of him, heading into an unthinkable, heartrending direction that left a deep impression.
