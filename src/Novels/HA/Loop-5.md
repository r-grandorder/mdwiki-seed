## Day 3


### Streets・Day 3 Successor

---

　Oh.

　I spy a delinquent Heroic Spirit squatting in front of the church.

---

“Whatcha doing, Lancer? Enjoying the sunshine?”

“The hell I'm not.

　I got kicked out, so I watered the flowers, sprinkled water on the road, and now have nothing better to do than just hang around.”

---

　...Uh, that's what people mean when they say "enjoying the sunshine."

　Then again, it might actually be what this guy considers warming up to the hibachi level. Total blackness that would devalue Archer's stock.

　Moving on.

---

“What do you mean "kicked out"? Is there someone inside?”

“Yeah, somebody came. Maybe a guest, maybe Kotomine's replacement. Gotta be someone from the Church, judging by the shabby robes.”

---

“...From the Church, huh. So you got kicked out by that somebody?”

“That's right. Had something to check up on, so I was told to step out for a while... Not the type of person I can handle. Keh, figure they'll go back soon enough, so here I am, just wasting time.”

---

　Lancer sounds pretty disgruntled.

　...Which is rather unusual.

　So there's actually somebody that this guy, who can have a friendly chat even with the likes of Saber or Rider, "can't handle."

---

“Lancer, can I go inside?”

“Be my guest. Gatekeeping ain't my job.”

　Careless as usual.

　Tired of just sitting around, he takes the can in one hand and starts sprinkling water again. With a quick wave, I open the door and go inside.

---

　There is nobody at the altar.

　The priest that had greeted me here half a year ago is still gone, just like he was at the end of that battle.

“Geez, there's nobody here.”

　I went around to the inner garden, the stairs to the basement, second floor, Kotomine's private room, but the church was completely empty.

---

“Hey Lancer. There's nobody inside. The guy must have gone out through the back.”

　...Hey. Lancer's gone, too.

　I guess he realized the futility of his watering endeavor and went to the park in front of the station again.

　Only the watering pot remained at the plaza.

　Oh well.

　Since the pot was left for me, I made sure to water the flower bed once more before departing.
