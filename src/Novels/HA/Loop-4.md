## Day 4

### School・Day 4 Crosswords and shogi problems

---

　Passing time in the student council room.

---

“...Hmm. Maybe capture the bishop with gold general at 8B.

　No, that's still two extra moves...?”

　Issei doesn't seem to have much to do, so he's solving shogi puzzles in old magazines.

---

　It would be great if we had a board and pieces, but there was nothing like that in the student council room. Since it would set a bad example for other students, any items used for amusement were not brought in... although this was Issei's policy.

　Not about to be defeated, I was also enjoying the Fujimura Taiga Blast from the Past crossword puzzle that the newspaper club had published. But while the genre itself was sure entertaining, it was just too tough.

---

“Hmph, why can't this knight do anything, he's such an eyesore. ...Hey Emiya, get me some tea! Hot enough to make my brain tingle, please.”

“Alright. Ah, there's still youkan left, want me to slice some?”

“Hm. A tempting offer, but I'll hold off on that until the three o'clock break. Snacking between meals is not proper.”

---

　Seems like it's not a break he's having now.

　Thirty minutes to three.

　I don't know if that's his self-imposed quota, but he seems to be intent on solving Question Three of the Compilation of Advanced Shogi Problems by then.

---

“........................”

　We immerse ourselves in our respective ways of killing time.

　With the chime of the four o'clock bell, Issei nodded and locked the safe.

---

“? Hey Issei, what was that?”

“This? It's a report saying what clubs will be presenting what at the cultural festival. It's separated by each class and each club.”

“I see... But, why do you keep it in a safe? To avoid theft?”

---

“Something like that. You see, the deadline for the reports was today at four. From now on, no matter what the excuse is, we can't accept them.

　Therefore, a class or club without a presentation decided at this point in time will not be allowed to participate in the cultural festival.”

“Wow. I didn't know the cutoff was at four today.”

---

“Yes. That's the only reason I was here in the student council room on a day off.

　Well, that's that. Thus my work is done for the day. Want to go eat something at the cafe in Shinto on the way back?”

---

　Issei gets ready to go home happily.

“Oban-yaki again? You sure like that stuff.”

　Naturally, so do I. I leave my seat without a further prompt.

---

“..................”

　Those presentations for the cultural festival, though... Which club was it that hasn't decided what to do, I wonder...?
