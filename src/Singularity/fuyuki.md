# TUTORIAL  
  
**C：???:**  
Fou?  
Kyuu... Kyuu?  
  
**C：???:**  
Fou!  
Fou...Fou!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...What's that sound?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...Feels like something just licked my cheek...

**A：???:**  
...  
  
**A：???:**  
...Umm. Since it's neither morning nor night, please wake  
up, Senpai.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Who are you?  
  
**A：???:**  
That's a hard question to answer suddenly. Maybe I'm  
not important enough for you to know my name?  
  
**A：???:**  
No, I do have a name.  
I have a proper name.  
  
**A：???:**  
But I never really had the chance to use it...  
I'm afraid I don't leave a good first impression...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Where are we?  
  
**A：???:**  
Right. That's a simple question.  
I really appreciate it.  
  
**A：???:**  
This is the passageway from the front gate to the Central  
Command Room, which is in front of the Main Chaldea  
Gate.  
  
---  
  
**A：???:**  
...Ahem. Anyway, can I ask you a question, Senpai?  
  
**A：???:**  
You were asleep, but I don't see why you'd sleep in the  
hall. Can you not sleep unless you're on a hard bed?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Was I sleeping here?  
  
**A：???:**  
Yes, like a log.  
It was such a deep sleep, it was almost textbook.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Yes. I can't sleep unless I'm on a straw mat.  
  
**A：???:**  
Oh, a Japanese carpet. I've heard of those before.  
I see... I see.  
  
---  
  
**C：???:**  
Fou!  
Kyuuu! Kyao!  
  
**A：???:**  
...I completely forgot.  
I still haven't introduced you yet, have I, Fou?  
  
**A：???:**  
This squirrel-like creature is Fou. He's a Privileged  
Life-Form allowed to freely walk around Chaldea.  
  
**A：???:**  
Fou led me here, and that's how I ran into you, Senpai.  
  
**Fou:**  
Fou.  
Mmkyu, Fou!  
  
**A：???:**  
He ran off somewhere again.  
He does that sometimes, just walks around.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...I've never seen an animal like that.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...What a mysterious creature.  
  
---  
  
**A：???:**  
Yes, normally he doesn't go near anyone aside from me,  
but he seems to like you, Senpai.  
  
**A：???:**  
Congratulations. Now you shall be the second caretaker  
of Fou in Chaldea.  
  
**D：???:**  
Ah, there you are, Mash. That won't do, you know,  
wandering about without permission...  
  
**D：???:**  
Oh, someone's already with you? You're...  
I see... The rookie who just got assigned here.  
  
**Lev:**  
I'm Lev Lainur, one of the technicians employed here.  
  
**Lev:**  
And your name is?  
  
<audio controls>  
  <source src="https://static.atlasacademy.io/NA/Audio/BGM_EVENT_2/BGM_EVENT_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

**Lev:**  
Hmm, Fujimaru.  
So you're the last of the 48 candidates.  
  
**Lev:**  
Welcome to Chaldea.  
I'm glad you're here.  
  
**Lev:**  
I heard you were selected out of many public applicants, how long was your training?  
A year? 6 months? 3 months?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...I'll leave that to your imagination.  
  
**Lev:**  
I see that you already know how competitive it is in here.  
You're going to hide your info from your rivals?  
  
**Mash:**  
Dr. Lev, Fujimaru's training was less than a few hours. I think it's from embarrassment.  
  
**Lev:**  
Oh? Well, now... I see. We had an emergency opening for applicants to fill out numbers.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
No, I didn't go through any training.  
  
**Lev:**  
Oh? So you're a complete amateur?  
  
**Lev:**  
Right... Come to think of it, we did call for applicants just to fill numbers.  
  
---  
  
**Lev:**  
So you're one of them?  
Do forgive me, I was inconsiderate.  
  
**Lev:**  
But please don't be discouraged because you're a public applicant. We need all of you for this mission.  
  
**Lev:**  
38 elite mages, plus 10 talented public applicants...  
Somehow, we were able to gather all possible candidates.  
  
**Lev:**  
That's something to rejoice over. This year, 2017, all possible candidates capable of Spiritron Dives were brought to Chaldea.  
  
**Lev:**  
If there's something you don't understand,  
feel free to ask Mash or myself anytime... Hmm?  
  
**Lev:**  
Come to think of it, what were you talking about with [ ♂ him / ♀️ her], Mash? That's not like you. Did you know each other before?  
  
**Mash:**  
No, I'd never met Senpai before.  
I saw Senpai sleeping here, so I just...  
  
**Lev:**  
Sleeping?  
Fujimaru was asleep, here?  
  
**Lev:**  
Ahh, you went through the simulation when you entered, right? Spiritron Dives can get to you if you're not used to them.  
  
**Lev:**  
After the simulation, the gate must've opened and you walked over here before you returned to consciousness.  
  
**Lev:**  
It's a type of sleep-walking. When you fell, Fujimaru, that was when Mash spoke to you.  
  
**Lev:**  
You seem to be fine, but I'd like to take you to the infirmary just in case...  
  
**Lev:**  
Sorry, hang in there a little longer. The Director's orientation is about to start. You should hurry over.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Director?  
  
**Lev:**  
The Director's the director. The person in charge of Chaldea, and the commander of our special missions.  
  
**Lev:**  
Since you're a rookie from the public, you may have only seen the pamphlet?  
  
**Mash:**  
It would appear so.  
Since the Director's profile hasn't been made public.  
  
**Mash:**  
Senpai has no connection to the Director.  
Only mages from families that have been around for over a century show respect to the Animusphere name.  
  
**Lev:**  
Right. Well, whether you know the Director or not, it doesn't affect your work as a Master, so it's not a problem.  
  
**Lev:**  
But it's good to not get on her bad side. If you wish to work in a peaceful environment, better hurry.  
  
**Lev:**  
There's an orientation by the Director at the Central Command Room in 5 minutes. She's putting on a presentation for the newbies.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Orientation?  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes, to greet the Master candidates assigned here today like you, Fujimaru.  
  
**Lev:**  
In other words, it's for the big boss to welcome the careless newbies.  
  
**Lev:**  
Since the Director is not the type to forgive and forget, if you show up late, you'll be on her radar for the entire year.  
  
**Lev:**  
The orientation begins in five minutes in the Central Command Room. Go straight down this hall. Hurry.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Dr. Lev, do you think I'll be allowed to sit in on the orientation, too?  
  
**Lev:**  
Hmm? Well, if you stand way back in a corner,  
I think she'll look the other way... But why?  
  
**Mash:**  
I just thought I should take Senpai to the Command Room. It's possible that Senpai might fall asleep on the way again.  
  
**Lev:**  
...If I leave you alone like this the Director might yell at me... I should tag along as well, eh?  
  
**Lev:**  
Well, if that's what you want to do, Mash, go ahead.  
You okay with that Fujimaru?  
  
**Lev:**  
If you have no other questions, let's head to the Command Room. Is there anything else you want to know?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I have no questions.  
  
**Lev:**  
All right, let's get going.  
Stand up straight, but remember to relax, okay?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Why is she calling me Senpai?  
  
**Mash:**  
...  
  
**Lev:**  
Oh, don't worry about it.  
To her, every human your age is her senpai.  
  
**Lev:**  
But it's unusual to hear her actually call someone that.  
This might be the first time.  
  
**Lev:**  
Actually, I'm intrigued.  
Say, Mash, why do you call [ ♂ him / ♀️ her] Senpai?  
  
**Mash:**  
The reason? Fujimaru is the most human-like person I've ever met.  
  
**Lev:**  
Hmm. Which means?  
  
**Mash:**  
I don't feel threatened.  
So there's no reason for me to be hostile.  
  
**Lev:**  
I see, that is important!  
People at Chaldea are all a piece of work!  
  
**Lev:**  
I agree with you, Mash.  
I think you two will get along just fine!  
  
**Mash:**  
...If you like Senpai Dr. Lev, the Director will probably hate Senpai.  
  
**Mash:**  
...Well, why don't we hide in the restroom to boycott the orientation, then?  
  
**Lev:**  
That will only make the Director more upset.  
We're going to have to leave it to fate.  
  
**Lev:**  
Shall we jump into the lions' den, Fujimaru? Hey, once you get used to her, she can be a pretty sweet person.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
This is the Central Command Room. Your number, Senpai... Single digit, you're in the front row.  
  
**Mash:**  
Take an empty seat in the front row.  
...Senpai? You're looking a bit pale...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sorry, I'm starting to space out again...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...Sleepy ...So sleepy.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
It's an after effect of the simulator.  
I wish I could take you to the infirmary...  
  
**E：???:**  
...  
  
**Lev:**  
No more small talk.  
See, the orientation's already begun.  
  
**E：???:**  
Well, that wasn't on time, but looks like we're all here now.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Welcome to Special Organization, Chaldea.  
I'm the director, Olga Marie Animusphere.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You have been selected, or discovered from each nation for your rare&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**  
...Are you all right, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...Uh-oh.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...Wait, was I asleep?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes.  
It seemed like you were in REM sleep...  
  
**Mash:**  
Anyway, the Director's slap seemed to wake you up completely. Thank goodness.  
  
**Mash:**  
You've been left out of the first mission, Senpai.  
I was taking you back to your room&mdash;Oh!  
  
**Fou:**  
Fou!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
A squirrel on your face!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Watch out!  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
No, no, this is normal.  
No problem at all!  
  
**Mash:**  
Fou likes to attack my face, slide around to my back, and settle on my shoulder.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
So you're used to that, huh?  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes. It's been a year since Fou came to live here.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Wait, are you the one who named him?  
  
**Mash:**  
That's right. No special reason, the word "Fou" is the first thing that popped into my mind.  
  
**Mash:**  
I'm impressed you knew that, Senpai.  
I see you're quite perceptive yourself.  
  
---  
  
**Fou:**  
Fou.  
Kuuu, Fou! Fou!  
  
**Mash:**  
Hmm, hmm. Apparently, Fou's embraced you as one of his own, Senpai.  
  
**Mash:**  
But can a squirrel who sees humans as rivals exist in this world?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He sees me as a rival?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Don't look at me, I have no idea  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Well, knowing Fou as I do, I'm sure he'll forget it by tomorrow.  
  
**Mash:**  
Actually, we've reached our destination.  
This is your room, Senpai.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...I see. Thanks for coming all this way.  
  
**Mash:**  
It's fine. If you ask me, Senpai,  
I wouldn't mind even if it's treating you to lunch.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
What team are you on, Mash?  
  
**Mash:**  
First Mission, A Team.  
Speaking of which, I've got to head back now.  
  
---  
  
**Fou:**  
Kyu... Kyu!  
  
**Mash:**  
Fou says he'll look after you, Senpai.  
That sets my mind at ease.  
  
**Mash:**  
Now, then, I'm off.  
If we're lucky, I think we'll meet again.  
  
**B：???:**  
Okay, I'm in here&mdash;Wait?  
Whaaaaaat? Who are you?  
  
**B：???:**  
This is an empty room! It's where I slack off!  
Who gave you permission to come in?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I was told that this was my room...  
  
**B：???:**  
Your room? This place? Oh...  
I see, so the last one finally showed up, huh?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Well, who are you?  
  
**B：???:**  
Who am I? Isn't it obvious that I'm a healthy, diligent and hard-working doctor?  
  
---  
  
**B：???:**  
Well, nice to meet you, Fujimaru. Didn't think I would run into you like this, but let me introduce myself again.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I'm the head of the medical department, Romani Archaman. For some reason, people just call me  
Dr. Roman.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I don't know why, but it's easier to pronounce, so go ahead and call me Roman.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Fact is, Roman has a nice ring to it, no?  
It sounds cool and vaguely sweet.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Nice to meet you, Doctor.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Yes, nice to meet you.  
I look forward to getting to know you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...Oh, so you're the fluffy type?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Fluffy? Oh, you mean my hair?  
I'm normally pretty busy so I just let it grow.  
  
---  
  
**Fou:**  
...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Huh? On your shoulder - is that the mysterious creature I've heard so much about? Whoa, nice to meet you!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Mash told me a lot about him, but I didn't really think he existed... Hey, why don't I teach him some tricks?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Okay, shake hand.  
If you do it well, I'll give you a snack.  
  
**Fou:**  
...Fou.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Huh, what? He gave me a really pitying look and then completely ignored me...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
A-Anyway, I think I get what's going on.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
You're the rookie who just got here then got on the Director's bad side?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Then you and I are alike.  
Just so you know, I got yelled at by her too.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
You know the Rayshift experiment's about to start, right? The entire staff's been sent to help out.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But since my job is to look after everyone's health.  
I had nothing to do.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The machines are more accurate at reading the vitals of the mages who are in the Coffins.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The Director said, "When you're here, Romani, everyone slacks off!" Then she threw me out. So I've been sulking here.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But that's when you showed up.  
This is what they called a blessing in disguise right?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Since we both have nowhere to go, why don't we spend some time and deepen our friendship!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sure. This is my room, anyhow.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Yeah. So that means I'm visiting a friend's room!  
Woo hoo! I've made a new friend!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
It's not like I'm a loner.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Hey... You already have a friend even though you just got here... What a people person! I want in!  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...So that's the structure of Chaldea. An underground workshop built on a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level...  
  
**Lev:**  
Romani, we're going to start the Rayshift soon.  
Could you come in case there's an emergency?  
  
**Lev:**  
The A Team's in perfect condition, but B Team on down is less experienced and they are displaying some slight abnormalities.  
  
**Lev:**  
It probably comes from anxiety.  
The inside of that Coffin is like a cockpit.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Hey Lev, I feel bad for them.  
Why don't I give them some anesthesia?  
  
**Lev:**  
Yeah, hurry up, will you? If you're in the infirmary, then you can get here in two minutes.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
This isn't the infirmary, is it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...but you're just hiding and slacking...  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Whoa... Please don't mention that...  
It's gonna take five minutes from here, no matter what...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Well, I think they'll forgive me for being a little late.  
A Team has no issues anyway.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Oh, that guy's named Lev Lainur.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
He's the mage who created the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba&mdash; A telescope used to observe that pseudo-planet, Chaldeas.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Sheba not only observes Chaldeas, but also serves as a surveillance system for most of this facility.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Also, it was the previous director who built the summoning/unsummoning system, which is the foundation of the Rayshift tech.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
To actualize that theory, the Pseudo-Spiritron Calculation Engine, (basically a super computer) was provided by the Atlas Academy.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
All these different talents have been gathered to carry out this mission.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
It's pointless for an ordinary doctor like me to be there, but if I'm summoned, I must go.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Thanks for chatting with me, Fujimaru!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
When you get settled in, come by the infirmary.  
Next time, I'll treat you to some yummy cake.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
What's this?  
The lights are out. Did something&mdash;

**Dr. Roman:**  
Was that an explosion just now?  
What on earth is happening?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Monitor, show us the Command Room!  
Is everybody all right?

**Dr. Roman:**  
Fujimaru, evacuate right now.  
I'm going to the Command Room.

The containment wall is about to close.  
Get yourself out before it's too late!

Wait, what are you doing?  
Wrong way, Gate 2's over there!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Don't tell me you're coming with me?  
Sure the more helping hands the better, but...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Oh man, there's no time to argue!  
Make sure you get back before it's too late!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...No survivors.  
Only Chaldeas is safe.

This was where the explosion originated.  
This was no accident, it was sabotage.

Mash, are you okay?

First, take a look around you, please.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Did you just say, "I will kill you?"  
  
**Mash:**  
That came out wrong.  
What I meant to say was, "you're going to be killed."  
  
**Mash:**  
Um, I was confused because everything happened so  
quickly. As much as I want to gather our thoughts, please look around you.

**Mash:**  
&mdash;phew.  
I had my worries, but we made it somehow.  
  
**Mash:**  
Are you hurt Senpai?  
Does your stomach hurt, or does it feel heavy?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
What was that?  
  
**Mash:**  
...I don't know.  
Something that doesn't exist in our era, let alone this era.  
  
**Mash:**  
That was the cause of the Singularity, or something like  
it. I guess calling it that isn't too far off, or maybe it is.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Mash, you're that powerful?  
  
**Mash:**  
...No, in combat training I always had to stay after class.  
I couldn't even do a pull-up.  
  
**Mash:**  
The reason I was able to fight like that just now&mdash;  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Right, I finally got through! Hello?  
This is Chaldea Command Room? Do you read me?  
  
**Mash:**  
This is Mash Kyrielight, a member of A Team.  
At this time, I've completed the shift to Singularity F.  
  
**Mash:**  
My sole companion is Fujimaru.  
Mind and body both intact.  
  
**Mash:**  
Rayshift compatibility, Master compatibility both  
satisfactory. Please register Fujimaru as an official researcher.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...So Fujimaru also got dragged into the Rayshift, huh?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I'm impressed you didn't "lose your existence."  
I'm really glad.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Also, Mash... Of course I'm glad you're safe, too...  
But what's up with that outfit?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
It's shameless!  
I didn't raise you to dress like that!  
  
**Mash:**  
I transformed into this.  
I couldn't protect Senpai wearing Chaldea's uniform.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
What do you mean by transformed, Mash?  
Did you hit your head? Or was it that...  
  
**Mash:**  
&mdash;Dr. Roman. Please be quiet.  
  
**Mash:**  
Please check my condition.  
I think you'll understand the situation better.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Your physical condition?  
Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Physical strength, Magical Circuits, everything's  
improved! You're not so much a human, but&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes, I'm a Servant.  
  
**Mash:**  
I don't remember how it happened, but it seems I have survived by fusing with a Servant.  
  
**Mash:**  
To investigate and resolve Singularity F, a Servant was provided in advance at Chaldea.  
  
**Mash:**  
This Servant lost its Master in that explosion, and was doomed to vanish.  
  
**Mash:**  
But at the last second, he offered me a contract.  
  
**Mash:**  
In return for the abilities and Noble Phantasm of a Heroic Spirit, he wanted me to eliminate the cause of this Singularity.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
A Heroic Spirit and a human, fused...  
A Demi-Servant? That's Chaldea's sixth experiment.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I see. So it finally succeeded, huh?  
Does this Heroic Spirit still have his consciousness?  
  
**Mash:**  
...No, he gave me his combat abilities then vanished.  
  
**Mash:**  
He never revealed his True Name even at the end.  
So I don't even know whose Heroic Spirit I am...  
  
**Mash:**  
...Nor what kind of Noble Phantasm I'm holding.  
At this point there's too much I don't know.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Hey, look on the bright side.  
Not every Servant who gets summoned is cooperative.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Now that you're a Servant, this is in our favor.  
After all, you're completely trustworthy.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Fujimaru, it looks like you're the only one who Rayshifted there safely.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Also, I am sorry.  
Forcing you into this without any explanation.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I'm sure you're full of questions, but try not to worry.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
You've already got a powerful weapon.  
Humanity's most powerful weapon - Mash.  
  
**Mash:**  
I don't know about "most powerful."  
I'm the one who gets blamed later.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Now, now, as long as Fujimaru understands that's what a Servant is, it'll be fine.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But Fujimaru, while Servants can be reliable allies, they also have a weakness.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
They disappear without their magical energy source.  
Their Master.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I'm still analyzing the data, but it's indicating that Mash has become your Servant.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Meaning that you're Mash's Master. She's the first  
Heroic Spirit you've entered a contract with.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I'm Mash's Master?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Uh, I can't keep up with what you're saying...  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Right, I don't blame you for being confused. I never  
explained what Masters and Servants are to you, anyway.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Now's a good time, I'll explain it to you in detail.  
The current mission has two new goals...  
  
**Mash:**  
Doctor, you're breaking up.  
10 seconds until the connection is lost.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Huh, so Sheba's output is unstable because we switched  
to the backup generators? Oh well, I'll brief you later.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Both of you, I'm getting a strong leyline reading about  
2 km from where you are.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Try to get there somehow.  
That way, it will stabilize our connection.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Listen, don't do anything reckless, will you?  
I'll try to bring the power back up as soon as&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
The connection got cut off.  
  
**Mash:**  
Well, that's the Doctor for you.  
You can't rely on him in situations like this.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
It can't be helped, let's get going.  
  
**Mash:**  
Right, you're so dependable Senpai.  
I was actually terrified, so thank goodness.  
  
---  
  
**Fou:**  
Kyu.  
Fou, Fooou!  
  
**Mash:**  
That's right, you're with us as well, aren't you Fou?  
Thank you for cheering us up.  
  
**Mash:**  
Apparently, Fou Rayshifted here with you Senpai.  
  
**Mash:**  
...Ah. But I forgot to let the Doctor know...  
  
**Fou:**  
Kyu.  
Fou, kyaao!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
He said, "don't worry about that guy."  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
You're right.  
I'll find the right time to let him know about Fou later.  
  
**Mash:**  
First, let's head to the coordinates he mentioned. Once we get there, we should be able to set up a base camp.

**Mash:**  
Senpai.  
We will soon reach the point Doctor specified.  
  
**Mash:**  
There are only flames as far as the eye can see.  
It's nothing like the Fuyuki in our data.  
  
**Mash:**  
According to our data, it's an average regional city.  
There's no record of such a disaster occurring in 2004...  
  
**Mash:**  
The Mana density in the atmosphere is also abnormal.  
In fact, it's a lot like ancient Earth...

The battle is over.  
Are you hurt, Director?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...What's going on?  
  
**Mash:**  
Director? About my situation.  
I know it's hard to believe, but the truth is&mdash;  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
A Demi-Servant, right?  
It's pretty obvious that you fused with a Servant.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
What I want to know is why it's successful now all of a sudden!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Enough of that. You!  
The civilian who showed up late to my speech!  
  
**Fujimaru:**  
!?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
How did you become a Master?  
Only first-class Mages can enter contracts with Servants!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
There's no way you could ever become a Master!  
What did you do to her to have her do your bidding?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You are way off base!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Well, don't look at me...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
There's a misunderstanding, Director.  
I'm actually the one who forced the contract.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
What did you say?  
  
**Mash:**  
I'll explain how it happened. That way we  
can understand each other's situation better.  
  
**Mash:**  
...And that's how it happened. We were dragged  
into a Rayshift, and teleported here to Fuyuki.  
  
**Mash:**  
No other Master candidates shifted with us.  
You're the only human we've run into, Director.  
  
**Mash:**  
But this gives me hope. If you're here, that means there must be other candidates who got teleported here...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...There aren't, actually.  
That much I'm certain of.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...I hate to admit it, but I know why we were shifted to Fuyuki.  
  
**Mash:**  
So you understand why we survived?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
All of us here share a common denominator. Neither me, nor you, nor that one "were actually inside the Coffins."  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Though Rayshifting flesh and blood isn't likely to succeed, it's not impossible.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Meanwhile, the coffins have breakers.  
When the success rate's below 95%, the power's cut off.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
So they never actually Rayshifted.  
We're the only ones here.  
  
**Mash:**  
I see. That's why you're the director.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You can be reliable when you're calm, I see.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
What's that supposed to mean?  
Are you saying I'm not usually calm?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Huh? You weren't planning to shift, Director?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Is that a problem? What commander heads to the front lines? Didn't I tell you that you were my tools?  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Hmmph, whatever.  
I understand the situation now.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Fujimaru, since it's an emergency I'll approve you and Kyrielight's contract.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
From here on out, you'll follow my commands.  
First, let's set up a base camp.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Listen, this is the time to search for a Leyline Terminal.  
A place where magical energy converges.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
There we'll be able to contact Chaldea.  
So in this town's case...  
  
**Mash:**  
This is the point, Director.  
The Ley point is at your feet.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Whoa! Oh r-right, I knew that, I knew that, of course!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Mash, place your shield on the ground. I'm going to set up a summoning circle, with your Noble Phantasm as the catalyst.  
  
**Mash:**  
...So she says.  
Are you all right with that, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Sure, go ahead and do it.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I'm not about letting go of the weapon.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
...Understood.  
Now let us begin.  
  
**Mash:**  
This is... The same as the summoning experiment chamber at Chaldea.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
CQ, CQ. Hello, hello?  
Okay, the connection's back!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Good job, you secured the connection.  
Now we can communicate again, and even send rations...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Huh?! Why are you running the show, Romani?  
What about Lev? Where's Lev? Put Lev on!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Waaaahhhhhhhhh!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
D-Director, you're alive?  
And you're unharmed? What the...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
What's that supposed to mean? Where's Lev?  
What's the head medic doing in charge?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Don't ask me why.  
I'm fully aware that I'm not cut out for this job.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But there's nobody else, Olga Marie.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Currently, the surviving full time staff of Chaldea is less than twenty people, including me.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The reason I'm in charge of operations is because there's no one ranked higher than me who survived.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Dr. Lev was supervising from the Command Room.  
There's no way he could survive that blast.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
No way&mdash;Lev...  
No, forget that, wait... please wait.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Less than 20 survivors?  
What about the Master candidates...the coffins?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...47, all in critical condition and we're short on medical  
supplies. We might be able to save a few, but all of them might be&mdash;  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Don't be ridiculous! Cryopreserve them immediately!  
Think about reviving them later. Your top priority is to make sure they don't die!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I forgot the coffins had those functions!  
I'll get on it right away!  
  
**Mash:**  
...That surprises me.  
Cryopreservation without prior consent is a crime.  
  
**Mash:**  
Yet you made the decision right away. You put human  
lives ahead of your own reputation as the director.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Don't be stupid! As long as they're not dead, I can explain myself later - why else?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
In the first place, 47 lives...  
There's no way can I carry that burden!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Please don't die... I'm begging you...  
If only Lev were here!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...This concludes my report.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Chaldea has lost 80% of its functionality.  
There's only so much that the remaining staff can do.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I'm shifting available manpower to Rayshift repairs, and maintaining Chaldeas' and Sheba's current states.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
As soon as external communications are back up, we'll request supplies and start rebuilding Chaldea.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's fine.  
I would've done the same if I were there.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Ah. Romani Archaman. I don't like it, but until I return you're in charge of Chaldea.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Make the Rayshift repairs your top priority.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
We'll be investigating this town.  
The Singularity F.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Director, you're not afraid to be at ground zero?  
Since when did you become so brave?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Seriously, you don't know when to shut up.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'd like nothing better than to go back now, but it's going to take time till you finish the Rayshift repairs.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
This town only contains low-level monsters, with Mash as a Demi-Servant we'll be safe.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Accident or not, we Animuspheres pride ourselves on doing our best in the situations we're given.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'll be looking into Singularity F with Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight as investigators.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That said, since my field staff is inexperienced, the extent of this mission will be to discover the cause of this anomaly.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Analysis and eradication will have to wait until after Chaldea's restored, and I can send in a second team. You okay with that?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Only discover it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
That would be nice and easy.  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Roger that. Best of luck to you, Director.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
We can now communicate in short bursts.  
Feel free to contact me in an emergency.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Huh! Even if we sent an SOS, nobody would come to our rescue.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Director?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Nothing, I'm cutting off the connection.  
Go do your job.  
  
**Mash:**  
...Director, are you sure about this?  
There's also the option of waiting here for rescue.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I can't afford to do that... After we return to Chaldea, who knows how long it will take to select the next team?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
A month won't be enough to gather personnel or funds.  
Do you know how much the Association will harass me in the meantime?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Worst case, they'll blame me for mismanagement, and I'll lose Chaldea to them.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
If that came to pass, I'd be toast. I can't go back  
empty-handed. I need something that will shut them up!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Sorry, but you're both stuck with me,  
Mash, Fujimaru.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Come on, let's explore this town. The cause of  
this twisted history must be here somewhere.  
  
## Section 3: Investigate the Bridge

**Olga Marie:**  
Stop. Before we start exploring the city,  
Fujimaru, isn't there something you want to say to me?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
No, nothing in particular.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Yeah, nothing in particular.  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...You're not very smart are you?  
Remember what happened in the Command Room?  
  
**Mash:**  
Senpai, it's probably about when you dozed off in the Command Room.  
  
**Mash:**  
It'll come back to you if you focus.  
That was, you know&mdash;  
  
<audio controls>  
  <source src="https://static.atlasacademy.io/NA/Audio/BGM_EVENT_2/BGM_EVENT_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3">  
</audio>  
  
**Mash:**  
We made it in time. Senpai, your number is...  
A single digit, in the front row.  
  
**Mash:**  
Please take any available seat in the front row.  
Right in front of the Director, what a bad luck.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...  
  
**Lev:**  
Let's cut the chit-chat.  
It's about to start.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Not quite on time, but it looks like everybody's here.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Welcome to Special Organization, Chaldea.  
I'm the director, Olga Marie Animusphere.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You have been selected, or discovered from each nation for your rare talents.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
By talent, I mean your aptitude for Spiritrons. People with magical circuits capable of becoming Masters.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'm sure you can't even imagine it, but be sure to keep this in mind.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You are about to be reborn as cutting-edge mages, in an unprecedented fusion of magecraft and science.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That said, although all of you possess special talents, none of you are special.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Understand that you're all inexperienced rookies, standing at the same starting point.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
In particular, the mages sent from the Association still seem to be acting like students. Fix that immediately.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Chaldea is my domain. Family heritage and  
personal achievements have no meaning here.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Always remember that my orders are absolute.  
My position is completely different from yours.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I won't allow arguments.  
You're all mere tools to protect humanity, nothing more.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...What's that commotion? Didn't I just tell  
you that I wouldn't allow any arguments?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You there. The one who came in late.  
Do you have a problem with what I just said?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...Yawn.  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Uh... Am I seeing this right?  
Maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Sleeping while standing...  
No way, right? Not in a million years...  
  
**New Hire (Female):**  
Hey, I didn't sign up for this! We're experts  
who were summoned here because of our skills!  
  
**New Hire (Female):**  
We came all this way on your insistence.  
Absolute obedience? That's ridiculous!  
  
**New Hire (Male):**  
She's right, you're way overstepping!  
  
**New Hire (Male):**  
Lineage is the most important asset for a mage!  
How can you brush it off?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Quiet! No talking!  
That's why I say you're still acting like students!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'm only telling you what's going on right now.  
If you don't like it, leave Chaldea at once!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Not that there are flights to send you home.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Though if you're ready to trek down a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level, that would be commendable.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Very good! Nobody's dropped out. Seriously,  
don't make me waste my time on such matters.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I wish you'd realize that's how dire our, no, humanity's situation is now.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Look. [ ♂ He / ♀️ She] is a good example.  
No argument, no opinion. Good and obedient.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Now, then, back to the topic.  
Are you listening? Today is&mdash;

Do you remember now, Senpai?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...Vaguely, I guess.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...In a way.  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Remembered... You weren't really listening after all, were you?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Honestly! Sit yourself down! How could you come  
to a Singularity not knowing the situation or your mission?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'm going to have to explain it to you again.  
Listen up! We at Chaldea&mdash;

Director, leave that for later.  
Enemies are incoming!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
All right! Good timing!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Let's go, Mash!  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Hey, come back here!  
Listen to what I have to say!

**Olga Marie:**  
...Phew. Good work, Mash Kyrielight.  
Now I can pick up where I left off.  
  
**Mash:**  
Resume... You mean there's more, Director?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Why, certainly! Fujimaru!  
Don't tell me you forgot already!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'm only half way through!  
In fact, it's the latter half that's important!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Make yourself remember!  
Make...your...self...re...mem...ber!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...Guess I have no choice.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...What a piece of work.  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Now, now, don't be like that. Director's ramblings can be useful, Fujimaru.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Why were you Master candidates summoned to Chaldea? This will explain that.

</audio>  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Listen up. Today of all days, we at Chaldea will achieve something that will be written in history.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The science of learning. The invention of religion.  
The acquisition of navigation. The focus of communication. The voyage into space.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Our legacy will be on par with the "Pioneers of the Stars." No, it will surpass them.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Rather than expanding civilization, we will be the hands of God protecting it.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Stabilizing human history, we will transform the future into a solid resolution.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The principles of mankind&mdash;  
in other words, to ensure the continuation of humanity.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That is Chaldea's, and now your only and absolute purpose.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Chaldea has achieved many results to date.  
The development of observation cyber daemon, Laplace.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The Global Environment Model, Chaldeas.  
Completion of the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate, and the launch of the Spiritron Calculation Engine, Trismegistus.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
With these technologies, we at Chaldea have observed humanity's progress one hundred years into the future.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
We do not predict the future, but observe it. Like many who observed celestial bodies, Chaldea has been observing the future.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Whatever it sees, our job has been to ensure that humanity will survive 100 years into the future.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Look up. That is Chaldea's proudest achievement&mdash;  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Created with advanced magical theories, the Global Environmental Model, our Chaldeas.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Planets have been defined as beings with souls.  
We copied them into this miniature Earth.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Because of the difference in scale, we are unable to read each single human mind.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
But whatever's on the surface, the city lights that can be seen on land, can be observed through Sheba.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Currently, it's been set to reflect the Earth one hundred years from now. Chaldeas may very well be the future of Earth itself.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
As long as the light of civilization shines within Chaldeas, we can guarantee humans will exist a century further.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
As long as there's light people will live in cities, and serve as proof of civilization's survival.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
But&mdash; Lev, could you normalize Sheba's polarization angle?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
This is the current state. Starting six months ago, Chaldeas changed color, and it's become difficult to observe the future.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The light of civilization, our beacon till now, has become largely unobservable to us.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Hmph, the right response.  
Good to see you've got some sense.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's right. The lack of light means that civilization has become extinct.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
This was considered highly classified, but you have the right to know.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Our observations indicate that the light of humanity is only visible up to the year 2018&mdash;  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
In other words, we've observed, no, proved  
that humanity will become extinct in that year.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Obviously, this future is not possible.  
It cannot happen, and physically speaking, is impossible.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
There's neither an economic collapse nor some sudden  
seismic event. We can't explain how humanity would suddenly just disappear.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Over the past six months, we've found the cause of this strange phenomenon&mdash;the disappearance of the future.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
If the reason is not in the present, then it is in the past.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Using Laplace and the Trismegistus, we've reviewed all data for the past 2000 years.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
We tried to find something that didn't exist in history, or was on Earth until this point in time.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
As a result, we finally found something new.  
It's this&mdash;  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Spatial Singularity F, a city in the Japanese countryside in 2004.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
We discovered an "unobservable zone" that did not exist in history up to the year 2017.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Chaldea hypothesizes that this is the cause for  
humanity's extinction. We proposed the Rayshift experiment to the U.N. and received approval.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The Rayshift process transforms a human into spiritrons, sending them into the past and allowing them to alter it.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Simply put, it's time travel. But not everyone can do it.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Only people with exceptional magical circuits, and the ability to become a Master, can be transformed.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Now&mdash; I'm sure that cleared things up.  
Your task is the investigation of Singularity F.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You'll travel 14 years into the past, find Singularity F, and destroy it.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
We are now entering unknown territory.  
There's no telling what you might find there.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
But you've been selected from among people all over the world. You can do this, and we have high expectations for you.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The higher-ups want to know the cause of this  
immediately. We don't have time to waste.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
We'll be performing the first Rayshift experiment in an  
hour. I'm sure you've all had enough training.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
For the first experiment we'll send Team A, the top 8 scorers, to Singularity F.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I haven't told the later groups, but they're Master candidates who have been chosen from Chaldea.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Team A has been active for a month now.  
You can call them trained warriors.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Team A will go on ahead and establish a base camp at Singularity F, guaranteeing your safety.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Teams B and below will monitor their situation and prepare for the next experiment.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Let's register your information with the Klein Coffins, the arks that will send you to the past as spiritrons.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
There's one for each person, and there are no spares.  
Be very careful with them.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Teams B through D will be on standby, in case of trouble with Team A.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
&mdash;What are you doing?  
I told you what you have to do.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You were brought here as a potential Master.  
You're practically a soldier now.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You will obey orders and be ready for a fight.  
Do not make me repeat myself.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Or do you have more questions?  
Hey you, the one who was late!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You look confused.  
I'll give you the chance to ask one question.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Is time travel possible?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Is it safe to change the past?  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...  
Does the word "Singularity" mean nothing to you?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The singularity we found doesn't exist in any of our observation records.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
It's like a hole that just appeared out of nowhere.  
The hole itself is cut off from the proper temporal axis.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The 2004 singularity exists apart from the past and  
future. There's no need to connect it to our present.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
It's more stable than regular time travel, and whatever happens the timeline can still repair itself.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Singularity F is like a tiny stain on the dress that is human history.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
It ruins beauty just by its presence.  
Your job is to extract it.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's what will return humanity to its proper, observed course of history.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...What is the Association thinking, sending me someone who doesn't know basic spacetime theory?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I told them this plan was a Grand Order, the highest possible duty in the world of magecraft...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Well, it doesn't matter. What team are you with?  
...Show me your ID.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
What? You're in the wrong spot!  
A civilian, and with no combat or training experience?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Chaldea is much too important to be wasting valuable slots on people like you!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Lev!  
Lev Lainur!  
  
**Lev:**  
I'm right here, Director.  
Why the yelling? Is there a problem?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
There're problems everywhere!  
Just get this amateur out of my sight!  
  
**Lev:**  
Oh...so that's it?  
Director, [ ♂ he / ♀️ she] is a chosen Master candidate.  
  
**Lev:**  
Sure they lack experience, but it's inappropriate to be that rude...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Having an inexperienced amateur here is a problem!  
What if something happens to my Chaldeas?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Let Romani handle this!  
At least get some basic training in!  
  
**Lev:**  
...Hmm, I don't think she likes you.  
All right, orders are orders.  
  
**Lev:**  
Mash, show Fujimaru their room.  
  
**Mash:**  
All right, understood.  
I just need to take Senpai to their room, right?  
  
**Lev:**  
Yes, thanks.  
I'm busy with the Rayshift experiment and can't.  
  
**Lev:**  
Don't worry. This experiment will be over in 2 hours.  
I'll drop by your room then.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Thank you.  
  
**Lev:**  
No need to thank me.  
You're really lucky, after all.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...  
  
**Mash:**  
That's unusually kind of you, Dr. Lev.  
Do you know each other from somewhere?  
  
**Lev:**  
Not at all. I was just thinking things like eternal rivals and fated encounters are very important.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Come this way.  
I'll show you to your room.

**Mash:**  
And that's how you were removed from the Command Room. Remember?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I see.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Got it.  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You little...  
You look quiet, but you've got some nerve, don't you?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Anyway! Do you finally remember how much of a mess you made at that critical moment?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Um, Director Marie?  
I think that's going a little too far...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Like hell it is! Thanks to the time I wasted on your question I didn't have time to change!  
  
**Mash:**  
Uh... You weren't planning to dive, so I'm not sure you needed your suit...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I did! I most certainly did!  
I had a special Mystic Code made for this mission.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Jeez, I didn't even get to wear it once...  
Well, it doesn't matter.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Anyway, you understand your responsibilities and duties as a Master candidate now, right?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Very well, Fujimaru.  
I'm ordering you to be my bodyguard. Work hard.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Aye-aye, oh great Director Marie!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
W-What? That's creepy. F-Flattery will get you nowhere!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...Are you trying to be someone you're not?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
This is who I am! I was just in a hurry back there!  
Once we get back to Chaldea, you're in for it.

**Mash:**  
...Good to see you two getting along.  
Let's move before more enemies show up.

**Olga Marie:**  
By the way, the type of being we call Servants, you know what they are, don't you?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I have no idea.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Just as I thought.  
It can't be helped. I'll tell you as we move.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Think of a Servant as the highest-ranked familiar in the magical world.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Various historical heroes. Noble acts. Concepts.  
They're all summoned as spiritual bodies.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Whether or not a hero truly existed, he or she is still "information that was produced on Earth," right?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
To summon a Heroic Spirit is to convert the information stored on this planet into something for the good of mankind.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
People today have the right to use legacies of the past, and with that right, the duty to leave behind a future.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Do you see? What you made your contract with is greater than a human, and yet is a tool to serve humans.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's why they're called Servants. Even if they're  
gods, they exist only to serve their Masters.  
  
**Mash:**  
Director. Your line of thinking may be extreme.  
My cells are not agreeing with what you just said.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Hmph. Meaning the Servant you fused with must be an Earth-type Heroic Spirit.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I do have some basic knowledge.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Glad to hear it. Now I won't have to explain  
rudimentary things like what a Heroic Spirit is.  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
<p style="color: #FF0000">Servants</p> are heroes of the past made into familiars.  
Those who enter into a contract with them and use them are <p style="color: #FF0000">Masters</p>.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
There are seven classes of Servants, which vary depending on a Servant's legends and abilities.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
It's incredibly difficult to copy a Heroic Spirit entirely.  
Human mages do not have enough resources or memory to achieve such feat.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's why only one aspect of a Heroic Spirit is fixed in our world, resulting in the seven classes&mdash;  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Berserker, Assassin.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Every Heroic Spirit will manifest as one of these classes.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's the true nature of Servants...  
It's also a way to hide their True Names, as well.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
They hide their names because they are famous.  
Take Achilles from Greek Mythology.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Achilles is an invincible Heroic Spirit, but his weakness is extremely famous, right?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
When a Heroic Spirit returns, their weakness returns with  
them. That's why Servants hide their names behind their class names.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
If you don't know their identity, it's harder to figure out their past or weaknesses, right?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's not all.  
There's another reason for hiding one's True Name.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
A Servant has a secret weapon worthy of their legend.  
The crystallization of that Heroic Spirit's miracle and existence.

**Olga Marie:**  
&mdash;  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I can feel the tension across the screen...  
The Director is grumpy as usual.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
She's not just grumpy, she's a total crank.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Why is she always so mad?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Well, I can feel some sympathy for the Director's ill temper.  
  
**Mash:**  
Excuse me, but Fujimaru Senpai, there's too much about Chaldea you don't know.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Y-You really think so?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Well, I admit I came here clueless...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
I really don't know what to do with you.  
It's like you're a lost little kitty.  
  
**Mash:**  
&mdash;Well, not that I'm any different.  
  
**Mash:**  
It's been about two years since I started here, and I still  
don't get it. I kind of sneaked in. Almost like an alligator.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I-Is that right?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
True, alligators have no clue.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes, I've learned as much as I can from the database.  
But I'll share it with you.  
  
**Mash:**  
Chaldea Security Organization. Or more accurately,  
the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity, Fenis Chaldea.  
  
**Mash:**  
A research observatory with the purpose of continuing and strengthening human history, with researchers, scholars, and mages from all around the world.  
  
**Mash:**  
They watch a world that magecraft couldn't observe, and science couldn't measure.  
  
**Mash:**  
We're a special organization with national support, created to prevent humanity from reaching a "bad end."  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
You sure know a lot, Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Yeah, I figured.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Anyway, that's pretty much it.  
  
**Fou:**  
Fou!  
  
**Mash:**  
It's true that Chaldea receives financial support from across the globe, but the majority of that comes from the Mage's Association in London&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**  
From the the Animusphere family.  
Director Olga Marie's family.  
  
**Mash:**  
Chaldea is a research organization, but due to its importance, it operates on a military level.  
  
**Mash:**  
There are extremely strict rules and punishments for everything, so the Director's attitude is actually reserved.  
  
**Mash:**  
The Director isn't a villain, but she is evil.  
She'll get rid of any staff member she doesn't like.  
  
**Mash:**  
Well, I'm not sure if it's okay to call someone who's got a bad attitude, evil.  
  
**Mash:**  
...Sorry, I wanted to give you some encouragement, but I'm not used to cheery words.  
  
**Fou:**  
Kyu. Kyu, kyu!

**Olga Marie:**  
Sigh... Please keep an eye on your surroundings.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Even if Romani is monitoring us, this is a Singularity.  
There's no telling what might happen.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Come here, Kyrielight.  
You're hurt, aren't you? I can heal something like that.  
  
**Mash:**  
Oh... right.  
Thank you very much, Director Olga Marie.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Really, now.  
When the director is calm, she can be dependable...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Fujimaru, you should know...  
The director is in a complicated position as well.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Initially, Marie was like you all, a Master candidate.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Three years ago, the previous director, her father, passed away and she had to take over Chaldea when she was just a student.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Since then it's been one tense day after another.  
She had to take over as head of the Animusphere family.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
It was all she could do to keep Chaldea running.  
Around that time, an anomaly was found in Chaldeas.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
We could no longer see into the promised future of 100  
years from now. There was huge criticism from the Association and our sponsors.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
She was ordered to get the situation back to normal as soon as possible.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
To make matters worse, they found that she had no aptitude to be a Master.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The noble Animusphere family, one of the Twelve Lords, the dominating faculty of Astronomy at the Mage's Association.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Oh the scandal that would occur if the head of such a family was found to be unfit to become a Master.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
You can imagine the level of gossip happening behind  
the scenes. I'm sure those rumors reached Marie too.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
She still worked to be her absolute best as Director.  
This last half-year, she's just barely been hanging on.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
She's worked herself so hard, I'd like her to come for counseling, but with how things are...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
In any event, she's been emotionally stretched to the  
limit. She doesn't hate you, or anything like that.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I know. Director Marie isn't an evil person.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I'm glad you think so.  
But you know she is evil, right?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
She isn't cruel, nefarious, and dishonest, that I can  
promise you. She's just a rather serious person.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
I was just having fun.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Hey, that's not nice! But I understand how you feel.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The Director wasn't allowed to go out much growing up, so everything she says is honest and innocent...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But make sure you don't say that in front of her.  
She'll just hate you more.  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Anyhow, you're the only three I can trust right now.  
I want you to continue investigating without fighting.  
  
## Section 4: Innvestigate the Port Ruin
  
<audio controls>  
  <source src="https://static.atlasacademy.io/NA/Audio/BGM_EVENT_5/BGM_EVENT_5.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

**Mash:**  
The hostile lifeform has been removed.  
Let's move on.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I didn't know what would happen with that monster, but I expected nothing less of a Servant's body. Such power.  
  
**Mash:**  
Not that it makes them look any less scary...  
By the way Director, I have a question for you.  
  
**Mash:**  
The Fuyuki in our data, and this Fuyuki are just too different.  
  
**Mash:**  
What happened in this city, exactly?  
What are your thoughts, Director?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Let's see, history must've been slightly disrupted.  
That's the only reason I can think of.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Mash, Fujimaru.  
I'm only going to say this once, so listen up.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Chaldea observes the future through an Earth model  
called Chaldeas. At the same time, a familiar called Laplace compiles past records.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You can say it is Laplace's job to gather data on history that wasn't made public, and information that was buried in darkness that no one knows.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
According to Laplace's observations, an unusual Holy Grail War was confirmed in this city in 2004.  
  
**Mash:**  
Holy Grail War?  
You mean the Holy Grail from the legend?  
  
**Mash:**  
The magical chalice that is the root of all magecraft, the one that is said to grant its holder's wishes?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Yes, that's the one.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Mages in Fuyuki City competed for the Grail, and in order to activate it summoned seven Heroic Spirits&mdash;  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That was the beginning of the Holy Grail War. Unknown  
to anyone, Servants were summoned to this town.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The Fuyuki Holy Grail War system is simple.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Seven Masters fight each other.  
The last one standing gets the Grail.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Chaldea learned about this in 2010. My father...  
I mean, the previous director used this data to build the summoning system.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's what makes up Chaldea's Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate. Our third invention after Laplace and Chaldeas.  
  
**Mash:**  
Third? Isn't that the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That was created by Professor Lev.  
Well, I guess you can say we both worked on it.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Anyway, this is where Servants come from.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Seven Servants fought here, and in the end, Saber was victorious.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The town wasn't destroyed, and the Servants shouldn't have been noticed by anyone, but...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Now this is happening. We should assume that  
the outcome changed due to this Singularity.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The anomaly in 2004 brought about an alteration to human history and as a result, we're no longer able to see 100 years into the future.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's why it's our job to repair this anomaly.  
Somewhere here is the reason history has been disturbed.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Once we analyze and eliminate it, that will complete our  
mission. All of us will be able to return to the present.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
I see. Got it.  
  
**Mash:**  
Anyway, although we're not sure what's going on, it's good that the mission is simple.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Heroic Spirits were summoned at Chaldea?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Of course.  
But it didn't go well, and there weren't many successes.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
According to the data, three were summoned, but I only know of two.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The previous director summoned the first.  
The second and third arrived after I became Director.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...The second fused with Mash.  
And, well, you know the third.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The weirdo that now lives in Chaldea.  
Leonardo da Vinci.

**Mash:**  
...Phew, the battle is over Master.  
I'm relieved that we pulled through again.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Good work, Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Thank you, Mash.  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
...Yes.  
I am happy that I can be useful.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Hey, Mash.  
Is it possible that you can't use your Noble Phantasm?  
  
**Mash:**  
Apparently. I don't even know which Heroic Spirit fused with me...  
  
**Mash:**  
...and I'm unable to use the power of its Special Arts,  
the Heroic Spirit's secret weapon&mdash;known as a Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Mash:**  
Fujimaru Senpai.  
I'm sorry for explaining this so late.  
  
**Mash:**  
Servants are equipped with a unique skill called a <p style="color: #FF0000">Noble Phantasm</p>.  
  
**Mash:**  
It's derived from each hero's legend and great deeds, and is a secret weapon.  
  
**Mash:**  
However, I am unable to wield my Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Mash:**  
...I can somehow use it as a weapon, but its output is decreased. I can't even release its True Name.  
  
**Mash:**  
In fact, I don't even know what the origins of this weapon of mine might be.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...  
  
**Mash:**  
In any case, you can think of me as a failed Servant.  
Or maybe just a capable kouhai that can get even stronger.  
  
**Mash:**  
I don't have any leads on the Heroic Spirit that fused with me, but with you as my Master I will figure it out as I grow.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's true. Masters have the ability to analyze their Servants parameters, skills, and matrixes.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Fujimaru... As a Master, once you become good enough, you should be able to analyze Mash's Servant data.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Any Servants you make a contract with from this point  
should be the same. First, you need to learn their True Name and Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
As your trust with them grows, your Servant's power will grow too.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Well, it's not like you have that much potential in you.  
The fact that you can't use Mash that well shows that.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Once we get Chaldea's Rayshift capability back online, we're going to shift a first-class Master here.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Then you're fired. Newbies with no combat experience can spend their time terrified in some corner in Chaldea.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Weren't you the one scared, Director Marie?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I wasn't! Not in the least!  
You should be respectful to your elders!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Could it be that you're worried about me?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
O-Of course! You're our only fighting force here!  
If you get taken out, who's going to fight?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
...Anyway, I'm glad you two understand each other  
better now. Let's move before any more of them show up.

**Olga Marie:**  
Everything's burnt down far as the eye can see...  
There aren't any traces of residents either. What happened here?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
What could even turn Chaldea gray in the first place?  
If we can't see the future, that means humanity will vanish...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Could that mean the Counter Force doesn't work in a  
Singularity? Then this place is like a Bolt...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The fatal choice of destruction scattered throughout  
human history... When your choices become mistakes, this is what happens.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Looks like the Director is talking to herself again.  
This could take a while.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Hey Fujimaru, looks like it's safe over  
there. Why don't you rest a bit?  
  
**Mash:**  
I agree with you, Doctor.  
Senpai, would you like some rations?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Thanks. Aren't you tired, Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Sure, but how are you, Mash?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Tired? Are you asking if I've been having any problems since I became a Servant?  
  
**Mash:**  
...Well, for the most part.  
It's scary to fight, but I'm doing fine otherwise.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Are you okay with me being your Master?  
  
**Mash:**  
Of course.  
I think you might've been the best Master this summer.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Any complaints since you've become a Servant?  
  
**Mash:**  
It's hard to explain.  
Imagine yourself becoming a jet fighter.  
  
**Mash:**  
You might be able to fly around in the sky, but you can't do your own maintenance.  
  
**Mash:**  
No matter how strong you might be, your existence essentially depends on having a Master.  
  
**Mash:**  
...The risk and reward makes sense here. But I can't be  
too happy when I think of the burden I'm putting on you.

Okay&mdash;Oh for God's sake, what is happening?  
Why are Servants here?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I see... A Holy Grail War?  
A Holy Grail War was going on in that town!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Normally, it would be a battle royale amongst the Seven  
Servants summoned in Fuyuki. But something's gone terribly wrong.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I'm not surprised there's a Servant without a Master.  
It's natural for Servants to target other Servants.  
  
**Mash:**  
Then as long as I'm here, we'll be targeted by other Servants?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
But Mash has nothing to do with the Grail!  
That's just a wandering phantom gone mad!  
  
**F：Servant:**  
&mdash;I found it.  
New prey. The Grail shall be mine!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Servant's signal confirmed, it's an Assassin-class Servant!  
  
**Mash:**  
I can fight!  
Senpai, please give me your orders!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
All right, I'll have us win no matter what!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Sorry, just bear with us a little longer!

**Mash:**  
&mdash;Okay.  
I'll bring you victory, Master!

**F：Servant:**  
&mdash;This is a waste of time.  
I could have handled this on my own.

**Fujimaru 1:**

**Fujimaru 2:**  
...Mash, fall back!

**Dr. Roman:**  
Fujimaru, they've caught up!  
There's one more, that's their main force!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
No way... We're losing to one already, and now there's one more on the way?  
  
**Mash:**  
Ah&mdash;  
  
**F：Servant:**  
Let's finish this, Lancer. I don't know what kind of  
Heroic Spirit that is, but I will have her head.  
  
**G：Servant:**  
&mdash;Ha. Hahahahahahahahahaha!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Director, Mash, hang in there!  
You got to keep moving!  
  
**Fou:**  
Fou! Fou!  
  
**G：Servant:**  
&mdash;Ha. Hahahahahahahahahaha!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Dammit, they both let fear get to them... Give your orders, Fujimaru! You're the only calm one now!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...We've got to run for now!  
  
**Mash:**  
Senpai!  
  
**G：Servant:**  
Fun, fun, fun, fun!  
  
**Mash:**  
Ugh...  
  
**G：Servant:**  
This is fun! I want to kill! Yes, run!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
We have no choice but to fight!  
  
**Mash:**  
...Understood, there's no other option!  
  
**F：Servant:**  
Ha! Futile! Fight, then you die. Run, and you still die.  
The demise of the futile, oh so miserable.  
  
**G：Servant:**  
Go ahead and struggle.  
Miserable people are ever so entertaining.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
F-Fight? Are you serious? We don't stand a  
chance against something like that, right!?  
  
**Mash:**  
...Even so, we must fight.  
I will find a way for us to get out of this alive!  
  
**F：Servant:**  
Ha&mdash; You've just killed yourself, girl!  
  
**???:**  
I thought you were just some girl, but it looks like you've  
got some fight in you. Then I can't leave you like this.  
  
---  
  
**F：Servant:**  
Ugh! Who are you?  
  
**???:**  
What do you mean? Can't you tell?  
Don't tell me the mud got in your eyes too?

Huh? Because it's better than siding with you guys.  
And hey, I don't mind brats with some potential.  
  
**Caster:**  
Young lady, be ready for a fight. Don't worry, you're good. You can turn this around if you just pay attention.  
  
**Mash:**  
R-Right, I'll do my best!  
  
**Caster:**  
Hey [ ♂ Boy / ♀️ Lady], are you her Master?  
Then I'm leaving the orders to you.  
  
**Caster:**  
I'm a Caster-class Servant.  
They don't really like me right now.  
  
**Caster:**  
Not like the enemy of my enemy is my friend, but for now you can trust me.  
  
**Caster:**  
In honor of the brave young lady there, I'll form a temporary contract with you and fight as your Servant!

Um, excuse me...  
Thank you very much, for saving us from danger...  
  
**Caster:**  
Hey, good work.  
You don't owe me for this, so don't worry about it.  
  
**Caster:**  
You should be more worried about your body.  
That damn Assassin kept targeting your butt like a pest!  
  
**Mash:**  
Oh!  
  
**Caster:**  
Hey, you look fragile but you have a pretty nice body!  
Icing on the cake!  
  
**Caster:**  
I have no idea what class you are, but you're pretty  
sturdy... Maybe Saber? No, you don't have a sword.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Hey Fujimaru, what did you think of that?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Without a doubt, he's an old pervert.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
...He's an ally, maybe?  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
For now, let's get some information.  
He seems to be a decent Heroic Spirit.  
  
**Caster:**  
Oh, so someone who wants to cut to the chase.  
What is this? Some means of communication through magecraft?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Well met, Caster Servant. I don't know which Heroic  
Spirit you are, but we have nothing but respect and awe for you.  
  
**Caster:**  
Oh, spare me your remarks. I'm sick of hearing them.  
State your business, weakling. Isn't that what you're good at?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Uh... I-I see. All right then... Weakling... I got called  
a weakling from someone I've met for the first time.

**Dr. Roman:**  
...And that's the current situation in Chaldea.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Currently, Fujimaru is the acting Master and in the middle of conducting field research.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Let me confirm something. You're a Servant from  
the Holy Grail War that broke out in this city, and the sole survivor?  
  
**Caster:**  
If by that you mean I haven't lost. Our Holy Grail  
War changed to something else entirely along the way.  
  
**Caster:**  
I don't know how it happened either. The city was engulfed in flames, and the humans vanished.  
Only the Servants remained.  
  
**Caster:**  
Saber was the first to resume the Holy Grail War. That chap began rampaging like a tiger released from a cage.  
  
**Caster:**  
Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker,  
and Assassin were all defeated by Saber.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
The survival of the Seven Servants...  
That rule of the Holy Grail War was broken here.  
  
**Mash:**  
And in the end you won, Caster...  
Or rather, you're the Servant who survived.  
  
**Caster:**  
Yes. Any Servant that was defeated by Saber became like those two, corrupted by the black mud.  
  
**Caster:**  
They, and the monsters that sprung up like maggots, started looking for something together.  
  
**Caster:**  
The troublesome part is that I'm one of the things they're looking for. You see, the Holy Grail War won't end until I'm killed.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
You and Saber are the only surviving Servants...  
Then if you defeat Saber...  
  
**Caster:**  
Yes, that would probably end the Holy Grail War here.  
But I don't know whether things would return to normal.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I see. You helped us, but in the end,  
it was for your own sake, huh?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You want to defeat Saber, but don't stand a chance  
doing it alone. That's why you zeroed in on us... Right?  
  
**Caster:**  
That's right. But it's not a bad deal, is it?  
At any rate&mdash;It looks like we've got company.

**Mash:**  
Sigh... Things have settled down at last.  
True, we can't have a decent conversation like this.  
  
**Caster:**  
My bad. If I'd been summoned as a Lancer,  
I could've finished off Saber with just one strike.  
  
**Caster:**  
Man, Caster is just not for me.  
I don't like being a Caster in a Holy Grail War like this.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
If you were a Lancer?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Is it hard being a Caster?  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
It's been known to happen, Senpai. Some Heroic Spirits  
have the attributes of multiple classes.  
  
**Mash:**  
He is not just a spear-wielder, but a high-level Heroic Spirit with qualifications to be a mage.  
  
**Mash:**  
...I'm only speculating, but he must be one of the top  
Servants. The kind that's featured in the magazine Vivian.  
  
**Caster:**  
Ahh yes, you said you were Masters of an organization  
called Chaldea... I guess that's all I need to know.  
  
**Caster:**  
In general, Servants tend not to get overly involved in problems outside of their own time period.  
We ultimately only cooperate as weapons.  
  
**Caster:**  
Your goal is to investigate this anomaly.  
My goal is to put an end to the Holy Grail War.  
  
**Caster:**  
We share mutual interests.  
So how about we join forces?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...That is a rational proposition.  
But if we do that, who will be your Master?  
  
**Caster:**  
Well that [ ♂ kid / ♀️ young lady] there, of course. It doesn't seem like you have the aptitude to be a Master.  
  
**Caster:**  
I mean you possess high quality magical circuits, yet you  
don't have the aptitude to be a Master. Is it a curse?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Oh, shut up!  
What do you care?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Fujimaru, he's in your hands.  
Use him wisely.  
  
**Caster:**  
Then it's settled.  
The contract is only temporary, but I'm counting on ya.  
  
**Caster:**  
That leaves one last thing, your goal.  
What you're looking for is probably the Greater Grail.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Greater Grail?  
I'm not familiar with that. What is it?  
  
**Caster:**  
This land's true "heart."  
If there is indeed a "Singularity," it has to be that.  
  
**Caster:**  
But Saber is lingering around the Greater Grail.  
The remaining Servants she contaminated, too.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Berserker and Archer are the ones left?  
What are those two like? Are they strong?  
  
**Caster:**  
Well, Archer can be dealt with if I'm with you.  
Berserker is the problem.  
  
**Caster:**  
Even Saber had trouble with that monster.  
But he won't attack unless you get close to him, so ignoring him is one option.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
We understand the situation now. We'll team up  
with Mr. Caster to obtain the Greater Grail.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Mr. Caster, would you show us the way?  
  
**Caster:**  
Skip the "Mister." I'll take you there.  
The [ ♂ kid / ♀️ young lady] here will decide when to make our move.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Much obliged. Then shall we resume the search?  
I'm counting on you, Fujimaru.

**Mash:**  
...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Hey, Fujimaru.  
It's pretty obvious that Kyrielight's looking depressed.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You are her Master, aren't you?  
Do something to cheer her up!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Mash, is something wrong?  
  
**Mash:**  
No! There's nothing different.  
I'm operating perfectly, Master!  
  
**Mash:**  
But that's the problem, nothing's different...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Could it be...  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes. I'm ashamed to be the one to say this, but...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Um, under your command Senpai, I have gained enough experience...  
  
**Mash:**  
And yet... I'm still unable to unleash my Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Mash:**  
I don't even know how to unleash it...  
I'm like a defective Servant.  
  
**Fou:**  
Fou...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Oh, so that's what was bothering you.  
You have such a strong sense of responsibility, Mash...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But I don't think that can be settled overnight.  
After all, it's a Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
If a Heroic Spirit's secret weapon can be mastered within a day or two, then Servants wouldn't be that special anymore.  
  
**Caster:**  
Of course we can master something like that  
immediately. After all, Heroic Spirits and Noble Phantasms are the same thing.  
  
**Caster:**  
If the young lady here can fight as a Servant, that means at that very moment you can use your Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Caster:**  
And yet you can't, which simply means your magical energy is not circulating right.  
  
**Caster:**  
Let's see, maybe enthusiasm? No, perhaps too reserved?  
Anyway, I'm sure it's because you just don't yell out when you practice.  
  
**Mash:**  
Really? R-E-A-L-L-Y-!?  
  
**Fou:**  
Faaaaaaaaaaa?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Hey, don't yell all of a sudden!  
You're going to burst my eardrums, seriously!  
  
**Mash:**  
Sorry Director.  
But Caster said we should shout...  
  
**Caster:**  
No, that was a metaphor...  
Well, at any rate, I see you have enthusiasm.  
  
**Caster:**  
Fujimaru, you heard the young lady.  
Do you mind if we take a quick detour?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Detour? What kind?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Don't tease Mash. She's an innocent girl.  
  
---  
  
**Caster:**  
What? I'm just talking about special training. It won't  
take long. I'm a Caster right now, so leave the healing to me.  
  
**Caster:**  
First we'll start off small. Let me inscribe some  
misfortune-bringing runes... Okay, we're done.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Huh? What are you doing?  
Why are you inscribing runes on my coat?  
  
**Caster:**  
Even if something targets you, you can take care of yourself, right? And look, here they come.

You too Senpai, prepare for battle!  
  
**Caster:**  
All right, that should be enough.  
  
**Caster:**  
To put it simply, a Noble Phantasm is part of a Heroic  
Spirit's instinct. It's hard to use it if you think too much.  
  
**Caster:**  
Therefore, you must first use up all of your energy, young lady! Man, I'm a genius!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
That isn't a cure, that's an extreme measure!

That young lady there is without question, a first-rate Heroic Spirit.

Right. Congratulations, Mash.

Fou, fooooouuuu!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
That was surprising. I didn't expect her to unleash her  
Noble Phantasm that soon. Mash was never someone with a strong will...  
  
**Caster:**  
That's because you got her all wrong.  
You may call the young lady here, a protector.  
  
**Caster:**  
There's no point in teaching a bird to swim, is there?  
You have to teach a bird how to fly high.  
  
**Caster:**  
Although...  
She didn't get to obtain its True Name.  
  
**Mash:**  
Right. Even though I can unleash my Noble Phantasm  
now, I still don't know its True Name, nor the True Name of the Heroic Spirit...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's fine, even if you are inexperienced...  
Even if you are only temporary...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Your very wish unleashed your Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
You didn't have the slightest desire to obtain a True Name, to become one of the chosen&mdash;  
To become a true Heroic Spirit.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's why your Noble Phantasm responded.  
Ahhh, what an inspiring story. Just like a fairy tale.  
  
**Mash:**  
Um, Director...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Don't mind me, I'm just teasing. I'm pleased that  
you're able to use your Noble Phantasm now.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
But it's inconvenient to use it without a True Name, right? I'll think of a good spell for you.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Since it's a pseudo-deployment of Noble Phantasm...  
Let me see... Yes, let's call it "Lord Chaldeas."  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Chaldea is a name that has meaning for you too. So to  
activate your Spirit Origin, that's a good spell for you, right?  
  
**Mash:**  
Y-Yes...  
Thank you, Director!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Lord Chaldeas... Yes, I like it.  
That fits you perfectly, Mash!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
And the desire to try it out after getting it is only human  
nature. Caster, would you be Mash's sparring partner?  
  
**Caster:**  
Yes, of course. I was holding back before, but even so, her defense was impeccable.  
  
**Caster:**  
As someone with more experience, I'll hammer the basics of Noble Phantasms into your head.  
Fujimaru, young lady, are you ready?  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes, please!

**Caster:**  
The Greater Grail is back here.  
It's a little far back, so don't get lost.  
  
**Mash:**  
This place looks like a natural cave...  
Did this always exist in Fuyuki City?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Probably, it's half natural, half man-made. It's the  
underground workshop expanded by mages over a number of years.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Anyway, Caster.  
I forgot to ask you something important.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Do you know Saber's True Name?  
It sounded like you'd fought several times.  
  
**Caster:**  
Yes, I know it. Anyone who gets hit by Saber's Noble Phantasm will find out that bastard's True Name...  
  
**Caster:**  
The other Servants were all defeated because Saber's Noble Phantasm was that powerful.  
  
**Mash:**  
A powerful Noble Phantasm, is it?  
What was it like?  
  
**Caster:**  
The sister sword of the Sword in the Stone.  
It's the most famous sacred sword in your time period.  
  
**Caster:**  
Its name...  
  
**Servant:**  
The Sword of Promised Victory, Excalibur.  
Wielded by King Arthur, the proud King of Knights.  
  
**Fujimaru:**  
!?

**Olga Marie:**  
Archer!  
  
**Caster:**  
Ah, speak of the devil. Or shall I say, the faithful follower.  
As always, I see that you're still the loyal knight.  
  
**Archer:**  
...Hmph, I don't remember becoming a follower of  
anybody. I'm just here to chase away unwanted visitors.  
  
**Caster:**  
In other words, you're the gatekeeper. I don't know why  
you're protecting Saber, but let's end this here.  
  
**Caster:**  
Isn't a game that never ends boring? For better or worse,  
we need to move the pieces forward.  
  
**Archer:**  
From the way you talk, I think you understand the  
circumstances. Yet you are still absorbed by your own desires...  
  
**Archer:**  
You still haven't changed despite being a mage now.  
In that case, I will knock some sense into you.  
  
**Caster:**  
Ha, big talk for a mere Archer.  
Hey, why are you just standing there, young lady?  
  
**Caster:**  
He's an Archer. Without your shield,  
I won't have the time to cast my spells.  
  
**Mash:**  
Ah...R-Right!  
Sorry, I was out of it for a second there.  
  
**Mash:**  
But no problem, I can do this.  
When it comes to guarding, leave it to me!

**Archer:**  
Well done, Mage of Flowers! Who knew her  
Noble Phantasm could be utilized that way!  
  
**Caster:**  
Hey, it's time for you to take a hike!  
The young lady and I will take down the Sacred Sword!

**Mash:**  
...I'm glad that you trust me, but do you think I can guard against it?  
  
**Mash:**  
...I've heard about the Sword of King Arthur.  
My fingers are trembling, it seems too much for me...  
  
**Caster:**  
Well, you'll just have to overcome it with courage. But  
from where I stand, you seem to be perfect for the job.  
  
**Caster:**  
That shield will never shatter, if you were to lose, it would be because the young lady messed it up.  
  
**Caster:**  
If you let go of that shield, your Master behind it will evaporate instantly.  
  
**Caster:**  
Listen, don't think about beating the Sword.  
All you need to think about is protecting your Master.  
  
**Caster:**  
That's right up your alley, no?  
  
**Caster:**  
Well, anyway. Leave it to me to finish off Saber,  
and just do what you need to do.  
  
**Mash:**  
...Right. That advice will be of great help.

**Caster:**  
Time for the Greater Grail. This will be our last break.  
Is there anything you've left undone?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
No, I'm ready.  
  
**Caster:**  
That's good to hear. I dislike Masters who can't  
make up their minds when push comes to shove.  
  
**Caster:**  
You're still a rookie, but you've got the most important thing a pioneer can have.  
  
**Caster:**  
The divine luck to grasp fate, and the ability to make decisions.  
  
**Caster:**  
Don't forget how to be reckless. People like that  
are the ones who'll get blessed by the stars.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Can we go back to the base first?  
  
**Caster:**  
If it's necessary, then by all means go back.  
We're attacking a bear in its hole, so we need plenty of supplies.  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I don't know what you're talking about. Whether we  
forge ahead or go back, we need to rest first.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Doctor, are you checking vitals?  
Fujimaru looks paler than usual.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Huh? Ah...Yeah, this doesn't look very good.  
It's because of the unexpected Servant contract...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
You never used your magic circuits and now they're  
running at full capacity. It's probably putting stress on your brain.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Mash, set up camp.  
It's time to make warm tea with plenty of honey.  
  
**Mash:**  
Got it, Doctor.  
I think tea time is a good idea.  
  
**Caster:**  
Oh, feeding yourselves before the final battle?  
Then maybe I'll go hunting for some wild boars.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'm sure there aren't any around here. Besides, forget  
about meat, if you must get something make it fruit.

**Mash:**  
...I'm stuffed. I can't believe you had dried fruits with  
you, Director. Again, your level of preparation astonishes me.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I just happened to have them. Citrus is effective  
against headaches. But that aside&mdash;  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...  
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Um, what is it, Director?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Would you like seconds, Director?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
No, I'm full! But from now on, remember that I like coffee more than tea!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
N-No, that's not it.  
That's not what I wanted to... Oh, forget it!  
  
---  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Th-The work you've done so far, has been passable.  
As the director of Chaldea, I have to give you credit.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
...Hmph. What's that look for?  
I'm sure it's a fluke, but right now you're all we've got.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
What I'm saying is, keep it up and you might hear praise  
from me yet. I know that even a third-rater can do first-rate work.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Well, well, admitting that Fujimaru did a  
solid job. Have you eaten something sweet?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Romani. If you've got time to be flapping your gums,  
use it to send Fujimaru a supply or two instead.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I would feel bad if someone failed because they were  
ill-equipped. Especially, when they have been doing their best.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
What's this? "Feel bad?" How kind of you. Director,  
does this mean you're finally opening up your heart?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Idio... I-I meant pitiful! Pathetic!  
You couldn't even tell that?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Well, I never grow tired of watching young men and  
women interact. Although when it comes to young women, Director, you're not really...  
  
**Mash:**  
Is that right? Certainly, the Director is older, but I feel like we have similar tastes. I feel affection for her.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
What are you going on about?  
I told you before that you're all just tools to me!  
  
**???:**  
&mdash;(Mm, hmm)  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
There, see?  
Even this shadowy-like monster-thing agrees with me!

**Olga Marie:**  
This is the Greater Grail... It's an ultra-superior Magical  
Reactor... What's it doing on this island nation in the Far East?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
According to our data, it was built by an eminent family of alchemists called the Einzberns.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Though apparently they didn't belong to the Mage's Association, and were solely made of homunculi.  
  
**Caster:**  
Sorry, that's it for the chitchat.  
The lady has noticed us.

**Saber:**  
&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**  
...Unbelievable magical output...  
Is that really King Arthur?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
No question. She seems to have changed somehow but she's the king of Britain, Arthur, wielder of the Sacred Sword.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Her gender's different than the legend, but she had her reasons for dressing like a man in Camelot.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I mean, you can't assume the throne unless you're a  
man, right? She must've had to pretend to be a guy for family reasons.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I have an idea who's behind that. It's mentioned in the  
legends, but Merlin really does have a terrible taste.  
  
**Mash:**  
Huh? Ah, you're right.  
I thought that person was a man, but it's a woman.  
  
**Caster:**  
Don't be fooled by her appearance. She's a monster.  
Her power is not of muscle, but a ridiculous amount of magical energy.  
  
**Caster:**  
Every single strike is massive. If you're not paying  
attention, the top half of your body will go flying.  
  
**Mash:**  
Basically, just think of her like a human rocket.  
...Understood, I'll fight back with everything I've got.  
  
**Caster:**  
Good. If you defeat her, the anomaly in this town will  
disappear. Listen, that includes both me and her.  
  
**Caster:**  
After that, it's your job.  
I don't know what will happen, but do the best you can.  
  
**Saber:**  
&mdash;I see.  
You've got an interesting Servant with you.  
  
**Caster:**  
What! You can talk?  
You were just maintaining your silence all this time?  
  
**Saber:**  
Yes, and you were being watched the whole time you  
were chatting. I merely acted as a scarecrow.  
  
**Saber:**  
But&mdash;it's interesting.  
I'm curious about that Noble Phantasm.  
  
**Saber:**  
Be ready, strange girl.  
This sword shall test the truth of your shield.  
  
**Mash:**  
Here she comes&mdash;Master!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Yeah, let's fight together!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Yeah, no way are we gonna lose this!

**Mash:**  
Yes! Mash Kyrielight, here I come!

&mdash;Hmph. Unbeknownst to me, my power has  
weakened. I stayed my hand at the very last moment.  
  
**Saber:**  
I was going to defend the Holy Grail to the end, but I lost because my tenacity wavered.  
  
**Saber:**  
Ultimately, no matter how my fate changes, I will always meet the same end if I'm alone.  
  
**Caster:**  
What's that supposed to mean?  
Bastard, what do you know?  
  
**Saber:**  
Eventually, you too will realize it, Ireland's Child of Light.  
  
**Saber:**  
Grand Order&mdash;the battle to obtain the Holy Grail has only just begun.  
  
**Caster:**  
Hey, wait! What do you mean by&mdash; Whoa!  
Oh crap, I am getting sent back too?  
  
**Caster:**  
Dammit! I don't like this, but whatever.  
[ ♂ Kid / ♀️ Young Lady], I'm leaving the rest to you!

Yes, you did a fine job, Mash, Fujimaru! The Director must be so pleased... Hey, where's the Director?

Grand Order...  
How did that Servant know that name?

Huh? O-Oh, right.  
Well done Fujimaru, Mash.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Several points are unclear, but let's call this mission complete.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
First, let's retrieve that crystal.  
It's the reason Saber became abnormal...  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
It's clearly the reason why Fuyuki City became a singularity.  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes. An immediate retrieval&mdash;What?

**???:**  
Well, I didn't expect you'd get this far.  
Beyond my plan's expectations and my own tolerances.  
  
**???:**  
Master Candidate #48. It was my mistake to naively overlook you as an improbable child.  
  
**Mash:**  
Professor Lev?  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Lev&mdash;!  
Professor Lev, you say? He's there?  
  
**Lev:**  
Hm, is that Romani I hear?  
So, you survived as well.  
  
**Lev:**  
I told you to come to the command room immediately, but it seems you didn't listen. Honestly&mdash;  
  
**Lev:**  
Trash who can't even follow orders.  
Just the mere sight of it makes me want to throw up.  
  
**Lev:**  
Why is it that humans always try to avoid their preordained destinies?  
  
**Mash:**  
&mdash;!  
Master, fall back! Fall back, please!  
  
**Mash:**  
That person is dangerous... Th...  
That isn't the Professor Lev we know!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Lev... Oh, Lev! Lev! You're alive!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Thank goodness! Without you, I don't know how I could protect Chaldea!  
  
**Mash:**  
Director don't! That man is...  
  
**Lev:**  
Hi, Olga. You seem well.  
Looks like you had a rough time, too.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Yes, yes, that's right, Lev! The command room blew up,  
the city's in ruins, and I can't return to Chaldea!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'm going crazy from all these unforeseen complications!  
But it's okay, as long as you're here we'll be fine, right?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
That's how it's always been, right?  
You'll help me this time too, won't you?  
  
**Lev:**  
Yes, of course.  
Honestly, all these complications have irritated me.  
  
**Lev:**  
And the biggest complication is you, Olga.  
I set the bomb right under your feet, yet you still live.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
&mdash;What?  
...L-Lev? Um, wh-what's that supposed to mean?  
  
**Lev:**  
Sorry, you're not actually alive.  
You're already dead. Your body, at least, long ago.  
  
**Lev:**  
Trismegistus thoughtfully transferred you into this land after you'd become residual thoughts.  
  
**Lev:**  
You had no aptitude for Rayshift while alive, right?  
You can't teleport while you have a physical body.  
  
**Lev:**  
Understand? You only gained the aptitude you so desired after you died.  
  
**Lev:**  
That's why you can't return to Chaldea.  
The moment you do, your consciousness will vanish.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Wh-What? I'll vanish?  
Wait...I can't return to Chaldea?  
  
**Lev:**  
Indeed. But that's too sad of a story for you.  
  
**Lev:**  
Let me show you the fate of the Chaldea that you devoted your entire life to.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Wh-What is that?  
Chaldeas is bright red?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
It's a lie, right? It's just an illusion, right, Lev?  
  
**Lev:**  
It's real. I've connected the dimensions for you.  
Having the Holy Grail allows me to do so.  
  
**Lev:**  
Now behold, descendant of Animusphere.  
Behold your folly!  
  
**Lev:**  
Not a sliver of blue representing human survival remains.  
Nothing but a burning, bright, red.  
  
**Lev:**  
That is the outcome of this mission.  
  
**Lev:**  
Isn't it wonderful, Marie? Once again, your incompetence has brought forth tragedy!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Don't&mdash;Don't be absurd!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
I'm not responsible!  
I didn't fail! I'm not dead!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Who are you?  
What have you done to my Chaldeas!  
  
**Lev:**  
It isn't "yours." Honestly&mdash;  
What an annoying girl you are!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Wha... Something's pulling&mdash;  
my body across space&mdash;  
  
**Lev:**  
I told you. That place is now connected with Chaldea.  
  
**Lev:**  
I could kill you now, but there's no grace to that.  
I will grant you your final wish, instead.  
  
**Lev:**  
Go ahead and lay hands on your treasure.  
Think of it as benevolence on my part.  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Wait&mdash;What do you mean, Lev?  
My treasure... You mean Chaldeas?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
No, stop, please! Chaldeas? A high-density body  
of data? A territory of dimensional anomaly?  
  
**Lev:**  
Yes. No different from a black hole.  
Or perhaps a sun. Well, either way.  
  
**Lev:**  
A human touching it would be a hellish disintegration on  
the molecular level. By all means, have a taste of infinite living death!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
No&mdash;No, no! Someone help me! Help!  
I...I don't want to die here!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Because I've never been praised...  
I've never been praised by anyone!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
Why? Why does this always happen to me!?  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
No one ever valued me!  
Everyone hated me!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
No! Stop! No, no, no, no, no...  
I haven't even accomplished anything yet!  
  
**Olga Marie:**  
From the moment I was born,  
I've never been accepted by anyone&mdash;!

**Fujimaru 1:**  
Director!

**Fujimaru 2:**

**Fujimaru:**

**Mash:**  
No! Don't do it, Senpai!  
If you approach that man, you'll die the same way!  
  
**Lev:**  
Oh? Impressive, for a Demi-Servant.  
You sense that I am a fundamentally different life form.  
  
**Lev:**  
Shall I reintroduce myself?  
My name is Lev Lainur Flauros...  
  
**Lev:**  
...In charge of the year 2017 sent to dispose of you humans.  
  
**Lev:**  
Are you listening, Dr. Romani? As a friend who studied  
magecraft with you, let me give you some final advice.  
  
**Lev:**  
Chaldea is finished. You humans have reached the moment of your destruction.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...Professor Lev.  
No. Lev Lainur.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
What do you mean?  
Is it related to being unable to see 2019?  
  
**Lev:**  
It's not "related."  
It's the reality that this is the end.  
  
**Lev:**  
Unable to observe the future, you babbled that it had "disappeared." That was truly wishful thinking.  
  
**Lev:**  
The future didn't disappear. It was incinerated.  
The moment Chaldeas was dyed crimson.  
  
**Lev:**  
Your end is certain.  
Your era no longer exists.  
  
**Lev:**  
Chaldeas' magnetic field may be protecting Chaldea,  
but any outside of it will face the same fate as Fuyuki City.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...So, that was it.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
We didn't lose contact with the outside world due to interference, we simply lost the outside world itself.  
  
**Lev:**  
Hmpf, you really are perceptive.  
A shame I didn't kill you immediately.  
  
**Lev:**  
But that too is futile resistance. If the time within  
Chaldea passes 2018 it will be wiped from this universe.  
  
**Lev:**  
No one can change the outcome now.  
This is a rejection of humanity by human history.  
  
**Lev:**  
You didn't perish because your inability to evolve, nor did you perish due to war with foreign species.  
  
**Lev:**  
Rather, it was your own foolishness! Your incompetence!  
Because you lost the grace of our King!  
  
**Lev:**  
Like a bunch of worthless scrap paper, you'll be burned away without a trace!  
  
**Lev:**  
Ah, is this singularity at its limit?  
  
**Lev:**  
...Cursed Saber. If you'd just obeyed, you would have been allowed to live.  
  
**Lev:**  
Even when given the Holy Grail, she caused trouble by wanting to sustain this era.  
  
**Lev:**  
Farewell, Romani.  
And you Mash, Candidate #48.  
  
**Lev:**  
Believe it or not, I have other things to do.  
My enjoyment of your destruction ends here.  
  
**Lev:**  
Now, be swallowed by the dimensional warp. But I'm  
not that evil, I'll allow you to say a final prayer.  
  
**Mash:**  
The underground cavern's collapsing!  
No, the cavern wasn't stable in the first place!  
  
**Mash:**  
Doctor!  
Perform an emergency Rayshift!  
  
**Mash:**  
At any rate, we can at least save Senpai!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Understood! I'm already doing it!  
But I'm sorry, it may collapse faster than I can fix it!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
If it does, then do what you can on your side! I mean,  
we can survive in space for a few dozen seconds, right?  
  
**Mash:**  
Sorry, but please shut up, Doctor!  
I'm so mad, I'm about to lose my cool!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Just hang on to your consciousness!  
If we don't lose that, I might salvage&mdash;  
  
**Mash:**  
We won't make it!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Mash, this way!  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Mash, you at least...  
  
---  
  
**Mash:**  
Senpai, your hand!

**???:**  
All right, you're a good boy.  
Want something to eat? Nuts? Or maybe fish?  
  
**???:**  
Hm, not sure if you are a cat or a squirrel.  
But that's okay, you are pretty cute!  
  
**Fou:**  
Fou...  
Kyu, kyu...  
  
**???:**  
Hm? Ah, the hero has awakened.  
There, there, that's how a main character should be.  
  
**???:**  
Good morning Fujimaru.  
You're conscious now?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Where...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Who are you?  
  
---  
  
**???:**  
Hm, you're not thinking straight yet?  
This is the first time we've spoken directly like this.  
  
**???:**  
What? Are you shocked that you woke up to the sight  
of such a beauty? I understand, but I'm used to it.  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
I'm Da Vinci, a Chaldea collaborator.  
Or perhaps the third summoned Heroic Spirit.  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Anyway, we'll talk later.  
Somebody's waiting for you, go to the command room.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Someone's waiting?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Is it the doctor?  
  
---  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Roman?  
Roman's waiting too, but he's not important.  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Jeez, there's someone else, she's the important one.  
Guess you're not used to being the main character yet.  
  
**Fou:**  
Fou, Fou!  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
See? This little one says so, too.  
Come on, time to get up Fujimaru.  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
From here on, you'll be the center of this story.  
The choices you make will probably save us all.  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
Just like the multitudes of brave souls who weren't remembered by history as they saved humanity.  
  
**Da Vinci:**  
You've been given a role to fight, not as a hero, but as a human walking a path that was preordained by the stars.  
  
**Mash:**  
Good morning, Senpai.  
I am glad to see that you're okay.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Good morning. Thank you, Mash.  
  
**Mash:**  
I should be the one thanking you.  
I was able to stay conscious, thanks to you.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Good morning. You were saved, Mash?  
  
**Mash:**  
Yes, thanks to you holding my hand. I now believe  
that saying "what happens twice will happen thrice."  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Ahem. I'm all for your reunion, but could you bring your attention here, please.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
First of all, congratulations on surviving and completing your mission Fujimaru. Well done.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
While the situation was forced on you gradually, you bravely faced the challenges and overcame it.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
That earned my respect and appreciation.  
Thanks to you, Mash and Chaldea were saved.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
It's a shame about the Director, but we've no  
time to hold a service. All we can do is grieve.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
If I survived, then maybe the Director...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Listen. We must defend humanity in the Director's  
place. That's how we pay her tribute.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I got the report about the crystal from Mash, and what Lev said.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
From Chaldea's state, what Lev said was true.  
We can't contact the outside world.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The staff who left Chaldea haven't returned.  
I fear humanity has already been destroyed.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Chaldea seems to be the only place outside of the  
normal timeline. Perhaps it's staying on the timeline right before the collapse.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Think of it like a colony floating in space. The outside  
world is dead, until we do something about this situation.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Can we even do it?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
Is there something we can do?  
  
---  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Of course. First, I want you to see this.  
We tried scanning Earth with the resurrected Sheba.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
It's Earth of the past, not the future.  
The Fuyuki Singularity was destroyed, thanks to you.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But we hypothesize that the future was unchanged due to another cause.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The result being&mdash;  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
This distorted world map. A newly-discovered  
dimensional disturbance against which Fuyuki pales in comparison.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
They say changing the past changes the future, but you can't overthrow the future by slightly altering the past.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
History has the power to heal itself.  
You might be able to save a person or two...  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...But the end of that era&mdash;  
Will still end up with its definitive result unchanged.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But these singularities are different.  
These are humanity's turning points.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
"What if this war didn't end?"  
"What if this naval voyage wasn't successful?"  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
"What if this discovery was wrong?"  
"What if this nation couldn't become independent?"  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The ultimate decision point to determine the current state of humanity.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Destroying them is like causing the foundation of human  
history to crumble. That's what these seven singularities are.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
The future had already been decided when these seven  
singularities formed. As Lev said, humanity doesn't make it to 2019.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
&mdash;But, we're different.  
Chaldea has yet to reach that future.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Do you understand? Only we can fix this mistake.  
Now we have a chance to return the singularities to normal.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
So here's the deal.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Rayshift into these seven singularities and get history back on track.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
It's the only way to save humanity.  
However we are still powerless.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
All other Master candidates are frozen.  
Mash is the only Servant we have.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
I realize you're being forced into this situation.  
Even so, I'll still say it.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Master Candidate #48, Fujimaru.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
If you wish to save humanity...  
If you wish to have a future beyond 2018.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Then you alone must go and face these seven singularities in human history.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Are you prepared to do this? Can you shoulder  
the burden of Chaldea and humanity's future?  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 1:**  
Of course.  
  
---  
  
**Fujimaru 2:**  
If it's something I can do.

</audio>  
**Dr. Roman:**  
&mdash;Thank you.  
With those words, our fate has been decided.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
We will now carry out the Prevervation of Humanity as laid out by Olga Marie Animusphere, former director of Chaldea.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Our objective is the protection and recovery of human  
history. Our search target will be each era's relic and Grail.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Our opponent is history itself. Many great Heroic  
Spirits and legends will stand against you.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
Challenging them is an act of blasphemy against the  
past. To save humanity, we must defy human history.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
But this is the only way to survive.  
No, the only way to take back the future.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
...No matter what sort of end awaits us.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
To reflect our determination, we shall abandon the original mission name, First Order.  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
This is now Chaldea's last yet original mission.  
The Grand Order!  
  
**Dr. Roman:**  
In the name of the magical world's highest order.  
We will take back the future!
