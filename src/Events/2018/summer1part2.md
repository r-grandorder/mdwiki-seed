# Chaldea Heat Odyssey ~Evolved Civilization~

## Prelude
 
**Narration:**
...What is civilization? I suppose you would call it the path every sentient being travels.

 
**Narration:**
Every single building, every single dish of food... It all contains a vast amount of our ancestors' knowledge.

 
**Narration:**
In that case, this landscape of destruction represents the end of said path.

 
**Narration:**
The extravagant buildings, the entertainment, the technology infused within glorious inventions...

 
**Narration:**
None of that can be found here.
A 2,000-year-old obsession crushed them all.

 
**Narration:**
We have no hope.

 
**Narration:**
We have no heroes, no brave warriors. We have no way to defeat them because the idea of fighting never even occurred to us.

 
**Narration:**
So all we can do is pray.

 
**Narration:**
Pray that the Nine Sisters, the goddesses who taught us of civilization and loyalty, visit this world someday.

 
**Mash:**
Senpai...
Senpai... SENPAI!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, get up!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
BWAH!?
 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Good morning, Senpai!
Looks like we've spotted land.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fou!
 
**Fou:**
Foou?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, was that an impression of Fou?
That was kind of cute.

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, Senpai, we have sighted land.

 

 
**Mary:**
Oh you're up, Master.
Yoo-hoo.

 
**Anne:**
It's been a long trip.
About two weeks, I reckon.

 
**Mary:**
More like three days?
My memory's fuzzy.

 
**Kiyohime:**
It's strange.
This was a long journey, but I'm not very hungry.

 
**Mash:**
Yes.

 
**Mash:**
It felt like we spent a long time at sea, but maybe it wasn't that long at all.

 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm... Yes, this is indeed a strange feeling.

 
**Scáthach:**
No, that can't be it.

 
**Mordred:**
Hey everybody!
The old purple lady's doing some foreshadowing!

 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, I must be getting deaf lately.
Did you say, “young and beautiful Scáthach”?

 
**Mordred:**
Young and beautiful Scáthach!

 
**Scáthach:**
Indeed. (Satisfied)

 
**Altria:**
That would've been a Gáe Bolg massacre...
I apologize for my rude subordinate.

 
**Altria:**
That aside, is something bothering you, Scáthach?

 
**Scáthach:**
Well... Sorry, I'll just assume it's my imagination.
It's not that interesting.

 
**Scáthach:**
We may learn something when we investigate the next island.

 
**Mash:**
...By the way.

 
**Mash:**
What should we do about Cú Chulainn and the others who were tossed into the sea during the storm?

 
**Martha:**
I'm sure that wimpy little samurai will be fine.

 
**Martha:**
He's from an island country.
I'm sure he knows how to swim.

 
**Mordred:**
Hmm. Karna should be okay, too.
Wasn't he the incarnation of the sun?

 
**Mordred:**
So even if he sinks, he's sure to rise from the west eventually!

 
**Mash:**
You mean the east, Mordred.

 
**Scáthach:**
I'm sure Cú Chulainn will be fine too.
He's a warrior who's strong both on sea and land.

 
**Scáthach:**
If we wait, he'll catch up to us eventually.

 
**Altria:**
You really trust Lancer, don't you?

 
**Scáthach:**
Yes, I do.

 
**Scáthach:**
...Actually, after all the things that didn't kill him, I'm not sure what would.

 
**Mash:**
(I can't quite tell if they have faith in them, or they're just getting neglected...)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I think they'll be fine.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, I believe in your intuition, Senpai.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's no way they'll die.
 
**Scáthach:**
That's right. They're Servants. If merely going overboard killed them, they couldn't call themselves heroes.

 

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Let's make landfall then!
Captain, stop! Stop, please!

 
**Mary:**
Roger! Steady as she goes!

 
**Anne:**
We're making landfall!

 
## Section 1: "Encounter in the Fury Wastes"
 
**All:**
 
SO EMPTY!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Wh-What's with this wasteland...?

 
**Mash:**
I miss the tropical island...

 
**Marie:**
The land looks barren...
I wouldn't try to grow any food here.

 
**Altria:**
What!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I mean, is there any food here at all?

 
**Altria:**
What... What... WHAT!?

 
**Kiyohime:**
It seems unlikely.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh, Master. Do not worry.
If you have to, you may eat me!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Cannibalism isn't really my thing...
 
**Kiyohime:**
I probably taste delicious, like chicken!

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'll take you up on that (if I have to).
 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh my! Oh my, oh my, oh my!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Did you hear that, everyone?
MASTER! IS GOING! TO EAT ME!

 
**Mash:**
Master, you should be careful what you say.
Look how excited Kiyohime is now.

 

 
**Altria:**
No...food...?

 
**Altria:**
No, Servants should be fine without eating.
It's just a little depressing.

 
**Altria:**
Master, on the other hand, will die from malnourishment. That is where the problem lies.

 
**Altria:**
In other words, it's a matter of what dies first: our spirit, or Fujimaru's body.

 
**Mordred:**
Why are those the only options!?
Let's just find some food first!

 
**C：???:**
Help!!

 
**Mash:**
I heard a voice crying for help!

 
**Martha:**
Yes, and if there are people living here...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's food!
 
**Altria:**
Correct! It is completely unimportant to me, but that would mean food!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
There's civilization!
 
**Mash:**
Maybe we can contact Chaldea!

 

 
**Mash:**
Let's go help.
But where did the voice come from?

 
**Mary:**
Anne, can you look around with your spyglass?

 
**Anne:**
Aye. Let's see...
It came from over&ndash;

 
**Anne:**
...Huh?

 
**Mary:**
What's wrong?

 
**Anne:**
...Oh, uh, I just saw something strange.
I must be tired from our voyage.

 
**Anne:**
Mary, can you look for me?

 
**Mary:**
Sure, but what&mdash;

 
**Mary:**
...Huh?

 
**Mash:**
What's going on, you two!?
What in the world&mdash;

 
**???:**
Retreat!
Retreat!

 
**Marie:**
H-Huh?

 
**Marie:**
A boar piglet. A boar piglet!?
There's a boar piglet asking for help!

 
**Marie:**
Huh? A talking boar piglet?

 
**Marie:**
Hmm? Eh? What?!

 
**Mash:**
Huh?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Ouch!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, it tripped.

 
**Marie:**
Let's go help it!

 
**Mordred:**
Well, I guess we can.

 
**Mordred:**
Let's put aside the fact that it talks and go save it, Master!

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Ughh...

 
**Shadow Servant:**
...

 
**Boar Piglet:**
(Praying)

 
**Boar Piglet:**
I hope this doesn't hurt.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Put me under general anesthesia before you chop me up. That would be great, yup.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Ughh...

 
**Scáthach:**
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

 
**Shadow Servant:**
...!

 
**Mash:**
A Shadow Servant!

 
**Scáthach:**
It seems we have an opponent to defeat first.
Come, no time to waste... Let's go!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Scáthach:**
Too easy!

 
**Mordred:**
Hmm?
Wait. What's that!?

 
**Demon Boar:**
...

 
**Mash:**
The Shadow Servant...is actually a demon boar!?

 
**Marie:**
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Maybe it can't talk from shock?
...Hey, look at these marks. It's like it's wearing glasses.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Glasses are cute.
 
**Mash:**
Yes, they make him look cute and smart.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Glasses on a boar piglet...
 
**Mash:**
It's not some kind of prank, is it?

 
**Mordred:**
It's gotta be a prank!
As if it'd do that of its own accord!

 

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Go&mdash;

 
**Marie:**
Go?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
GODDESSES! ARE YOU ALL GODDESSES!?

 
**Marie:**
...Goddesses?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, did you call me?

 
**Mordred:**
I don't think so...

 
**Boar Piglet:**
The goddesses have descended upon us! They have descended upon us! I know it's rude for me to ask, but I'm going to anyway!

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Please&mdash;

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Save this world!

 
**All:**
...WHAT!?

 
**Fou:**
...Fou?

 
**???:**
So the time has come. They are here.

 
**???:**
The ones who will come to restore this world...

 
**Demon Boar:**
?

 
**???:**
No need to understand.
I do not expect intelligence from you.

 
**???:**
You are violent and destructive.

 
**???:**
You are raging lightning that has dragged this world back to nothingness many times.

 
**???:**
Go and destroy.
Kill all boars who dare to resist.

 
**???:**
I've had the benefit of time on my side, Servants.
This time, I will win!

 
## Section 2: "Nine Sisters"
 
**Mash:**
This seems like it was once a city.
All the buildings have collapsed.

 
**Mary:**
So, people once lived here?

 
**Anne:**
Apparently so.

 
**Anne:**
It appears to have been a more advanced civilization than the one we're familiar with in our era.

 
**Anne:**
Perhaps on par with the one in Master's time, in fact&ndash;though I haven't experienced it for myself.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah.

 
**Scáthach:**
It doesn't match with any era we lived in.

 
**Scáthach:**
As Anne said, it is equivalent to Mash and Fujimaru's.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
This way, yup!

 
**Marie:**
Okay!

 
**Mash:**
Master, let's follow the boar piglet for now.

 
**Mash:**
I've never seen a talking boar before, but I've seen several talking monsters.

 
**Mash:**
I think we'll get used to it quickly.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's up with the glasses?
 
**Scáthach:**
You keep going back to that, don't you?
Do you have a thing for glasses?

 
**Mash:**
♪

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I hope there are people there.
 
**Mash:**
Yes.

 
**Mordred:**
Well, I don't know about that.

 
**Altria:**
...Indeed.

 

 
**Altria:**
Master, have you noticed?

 
**Altria:**
The boar piglet speaks as if they've never met humans before.

 
**Altria:**
Couple that with all these collapsed buildings and...
Well, we may already be too late.

 
**Scáthach:**
Let us believe in this little one for now and keep going.

 
**Scáthach:**
...Let's go!

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Chief! Chief, Chief, Chief!

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
My child, what is this commotion? What happened? You're hurt.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
...Did you go outside the city again?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
It was an emergency situation!
I was hungry, yup!

 
**Boar Piglet:**
The old snacks I found were delicious, yup.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Foolish child! That doesn't make it okay!
...So? What's all the fuss?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
The goddesses!

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
The goddesses?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
I've brought them here, yup!

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
...You brought them?

 
**Marie:**
Hello.
Um, Chief, is it?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Hmm...

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Oh no! The chief has fallen! Arteriosclerosis!
Or maybe just a heart attack!?

 
**Martha:**
He just fainted from shock.
Just needs a pat on the back... Like so!

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
GWAH!?
Whew. It was just a dream.

 
**Mordred:**
Oh, he woke up.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
...It wasn't a dream...

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Chief, are you okay?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Not really.
So, what is going on?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
I see. You came from another island...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
We had no idea that there was an island so close.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Either way, thank you for saving my grandchild.

 
**Mash:**
Are there no humans here?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
There haven't been any living humans here for a good 50 years.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
...Though I have seen “humans” that aren't exactly human, per se.

 
**Altria:**
You mean the Shadow Servants?

 
**Mary:**
Huh? Then who made these buildings?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
We did.

 
**All:**
...Huh?

 
**Mash:**
Um, I'm sorry.
...Did you say the boar piglets made this town?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Until about 50 years ago, the Boar Piglet Clan was extremely prosperous.

 
**Mordred:**
(...So they are an actual clan.)

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
We had rows of skyscrapers, robots to do our bidding, and we were even preparing to go into space.

 
**Marie:**
I see. (I don't see.)

 
**Scáthach:**
Space, huh...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sci-fi?
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, he's still talking.
Don't interrupt.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
A little uncanny?
 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
It is very uncanny, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Space is so romantic, yup!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Our clan has reached Childhood's End, and its off to The Next Generation, yup!

 

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
But 50 years ago, the demon boars we thought had gone extinct reappeared.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
As did black spirits shaped like humans.

 
**Scáthach:**
Shadow Servants, huh...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
They formed an army and destroyed all the civilization we built up on this island.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Now even the Boar Piglet Clan is on the verge of destruction. We simply wait for our end.

 
**Marie:**
Oh, how awful...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Destroying civilization?
Sounds just like Altera.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
By the way, what did you mean by “goddesses”?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
There's a legend in the Boar Piglet Clan about nine goddesses called the Nine Sisters.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
We were just beasts who lived on instinct until they gave us civilization, love, and courage.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
They also took the form of humans, which is probably where he got the idea you were them.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
(Gasp!)

 
**Boar Piglet:**
The way she gave that demon boar a complete beatdown, I was sure she was a goddess!

 
**Marie:**
Oh my. Hehehe. I don't know if I'm good enough to be called a goddess.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Boo! Boo!

 
**Marie:**
(Rub rub)
Oh, how soft and fluffy.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Aww, hehe.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
I'm sorry I don't have anything to offer you...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
But there are buildings nearby that are still intact enough to keep you out of the rain...probably.

 
**Mash:**
Thank you.
Oh, excuse me. I have one last question.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
What is it?

 
**Mash:**
Have you ever heard the word “Chaldea” before?

 
**Mash:**
Or anything about technology that would let you travel dimensions, world, or time?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Chaldea... Chaldea?
Hmm... No, I haven't.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
But we did do some research on traveling through time and to other worlds 50 years ago.

 
**Mash:**
I see...

 
**Mash:**
Master, let's decide on our next move.

 
**Mash:**
Should we leave this island or live here like we did on the one before?

 
**Mary:**
It doesn't look like there are any clues here, so we could easily just take our ship and go.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
This place is already in ruins. Searching for another island would be the normal Tamamo-style suggestion.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Mmm. It's a bit of a shame, though.
To be honest, this place interests me!

 
**Marie:**
Yes! I think we should stay too!
Let's help the piglets!

 
**Altria:**
I knew Marie would say that.

 
**Anne:**
If we go to the next island, we may be able to find a clue to get us back to Chaldea.

 
**Anne:**
Or maybe our communications might be restored.

 
**Martha:**
But they might not.
Who knows if we'll even find another island.

 
**Mordred:**
I...I think it's okay to stay here.
The boar piglets will go extinct at this rate.

 
**Scáthach:**
...

 
**Kiyohime:**
I shall do whatever Master says!

 
**Mash:**
Master.
What shall we do?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I want to save them.
 
**Marie:**
You really are the best Master in the world,
Fujimaru!

 
**Marie:**
I'll give you a kiss as a reward!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, it's okay to be smitten about it, but be careful.

 
**Mash:**
Kiyohime's got a look in her eyes like she wants to swallow you whole!

 
**Kiyohime:**
...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We'll start over on this island!
 
**Mordred:**
Gah! Startin' over, huh? Fine!
We gotta do what we gotta do!

 
**Altria:**
You look like you're enjoying it.

 
**Mary:**
Well, one starts from the bottom all the time.
Don't let it get you down, Master... Oh, okay, you aren't.

 
**Mary:**
You're so positive, Master.
Nothing like our last captain.

 

 
**Scáthach:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Scáthach?
What's wrong?

 
**Scáthach:**
Ah, nothing.
So, we're staying?

 
**Scáthach:**
I'm not opposed to it.
In fact, I'm all for it.

 
**Scáthach:**
We can help develop this island and defeat the demon boars. My one worry is&mdash;

 
**Scáthach:**
What we're going to find when the former is done.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
You're...going to save us?

 
**Scáthach:**
No. This is more of a contract.

 
**Scáthach:**
You'll help us develop the island and discover new technologies.

 
**Scáthach:**
If a demon boar attacks, we'll defeat it.
And also eat it.

 
**Altria:**
This is equivalent exchange.
One of the fundamentals of trading.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Thank you! Thank you!

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
You really are the goddesses reborn!
The Nine Sisters have returned!

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Goddesses! Our saviors!

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Goddesses! Turn this way!

 
**Boar Piglets:**
So amazing! So cool!

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Mommy! Take care of me!

 
**Scáthach:**
...I think that last one was a little strange.
But I suppose that's okay.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
No, wait a second. Nine goddesses?
There's ten of us (not including Master) here!

 
**Mash:**
Maybe they're not including me.
Compared to everyone else I'm a little plain.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's not true.

 
**Mash:**
...Thank you.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Um, according to the legend...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
There were ten goddesses originally, but one of them was extremely scary.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
So eventually we started to say to ourselves,
“Maybe we can just cut her out.”

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, that happens a lot.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
A deity who admonishes and threatens the masses somehow always ends up being demonized eventually.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Hard to argue something like that when it's coming from Tamamo.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Yes. They say this former goddess and current devil...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
...had shining eyes like a beast, hair the color of a peach, a fluffy tail...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
...and used an umbrella as a weapon.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
She was a terrifying devil whose favorite food was boar piglets.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...Huh?

 
**Kiyohime:**
...Oh?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
No, no, no.
It's just a coincidence.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
CO. IN. CI. DENCE.

 
**Altria:**
Don't worry, Tamamo.

 
**Altria:**
You were summoned as a Servant because you changed your ways.

 
**Altria:**
No matter how many of this island's piglets you chomped down on in life...

 
**Altria:**
No matter how delicious they... I mean, no matter what wicked act you performed, we are comrades!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I didn't do it!
It wasn't me, okay?

 
**Mordred:**
Listen, you guys.

 
**Mordred:**
Don't go anywhere alone with that blonde king wearing white!

 
**Mordred:**
You'll get eaten whole!

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Scary, yup!

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, could this be...?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A coincidence...maybe?
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It is a coincidence!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
If you start doubting me too, Master, what am I supposed to do?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
She ends up as the devil?
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
That won't happen (in the Good Ending)!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Why? Because I was voted the number one Servant you'd want to protect!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yep, just a slightly attractive, good-natured, well-bred Servant lacking in fighting prowess! A proud Cas&ndash;
I mean, Lancer!

 

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Ahem! Ahem! Ahem! ANYWAY!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
First, let's search this island!
It's time for an adventure!


## Section 3: "I'm Back, I'm Home" (1/2)
 
**Scáthach:**
All right! We'll be heading out soon!

 
**Scáthach:**
Today's search party will be me, Fujimaru, Mash, Tamamo, and Marie...

 
**Mash:**
R-Right!

 
**Scáthach:**
Mordred, do you want to come, too?

 
**Mordred:**
Oh, if you're going to the coast, I'll have the chance to ride some waves! As a knight, I can't refuse such an invitation!

 
**Altria:**
(So it's an excuse to get out of doing work. Fine, but when we get back, I'll give you a double workload...)

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Whew, good. I mean, is it my imagination or are the boar piglets scared of me?

 
**Scáthach:**
Well, you are the wicked devil who wolfs down boar piglets...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I've never eaten a single one! Maybe I've considered it, but it was only a thought! A thought!

 
**Marie:**
I don't think they would be tasty...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It's not about whether they're tasty or not.
The issue is that I have animal instincts.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Hmph, never mind! Never mind!
Master, please comfort your heartbroken Tamamo!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There, there.
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Heh. Petting my fur roughly and softly simultaneously... How skillful...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
You get the Fluffing Seal of Approval!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're cute, Tamamo.
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Ah! Sweet words so straightforward like that make my heart go pitter-patter. You are forbidden from using them with anyone but me!

 

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, let's be serious,

 
**Mash:**
OKAY!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...Mm? I hear something. Sounds like an enemy attack.

 
**Scáthach:**
Another fake Servant?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I do remember this sound, but I believe what we have here is a little different...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Well, we'll know for sure when we beat them.

 
**Scáthach:**
Here they come... Let's go!

 
## Section 3: "I'm Back, I'm Home" (2/2) (Mordred)
 
**Mash:**
It seems demon boars aren't the only enemies here.

 
**Scáthach:**
This doesn't look like the work of a demon boar. The piglets may have made them for protection...either for themselves or for others.

 
**Scáthach:**
At any rate, it seems their creations weren't enough to defeat the demon boars.

 
**Scáthach:**
And there were automata lying on the ground besides the ones we defeated.

 
**Marie:**
They felt powerful enough to me just now...

 
**Marie:**
If nothing else, they seem stronger than the demon boars we fought.

 
**Scáthach:**
...Which means the latter are just small fry compared to something else on this island.

 
**Scáthach:**
It's probably just up ahead.
Let's move, Master.

 
**Scáthach:**
I can't imagine giant demon boars like the one we saw on the previous island would simply show up, however...

 
**Scáthach:**
If we don't deal with them, they will quickly grow in power.

 
**Scáthach:**
It's possible we might see multiple fortress-class enemies.

 
**Scáthach:**
Everyone, stay on your guard.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
This has become problematic...

 
**Scáthach:**
Well, we can also sit around and wait for that to happen.

 
**Scáthach:**
Fortress-class demon boars... Just as strong as Clan Calatin, or even... Hehehehehe.

**Fujimaru 1:**
Keep a lid on the bloodlust.
 
**Scáthach:**
R-Right. I know. I know.

 
**Scáthach:**
I'm a good Servant who properly obeys my Master's orders.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Vetoed.
 
**Scáthach:**
Vetoed, huh...

 

 
**Marie:**
Oh, I can see it!

 
**Demon Boar:**
...

 
**Marie:**
Th-This demon boar...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It's huge!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It's as big as that giant one from before!

 
**Mash:**
...But it doesn't seem to be the same thing.

 
**Scáthach:**
It seems to be protecting this tree.
Hmm?

 
**Marie:**
What's wrong?

 
**Scáthach:**
...Oh, I see.
So that's what's going on.

 
**Scáthach:**
I see... I see.
I get it now. Hmmm...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What?
 
**Scáthach:**
I'll show you later when this is over.

 
**Scáthach:**
There's probably something waiting for us up ahead. When you see it, you'll understand whether you want to or not.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Notice something?
 
**Scáthach:**
Sort of.
But it doesn't really affect our situation.

 
**Scáthach:**
There's just one problem.
This island might be bad news.

 
**Mash:**
Bad news?

 
**Mordred:**
Come on, tell us!

 
**Marie:**
You seem to know something!

 
**Scáthach:**
Of course.
Beautiful women keep many secrets, you know.

 

 
**Demon Boar:**
...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh? Its mouth is open like it wants to say something...

 
**Demon Boar:**
Gi... Gigi.
Giiiiiiiiiiiii!

 
**Marie:**
Eeee!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I-It transformed!
Now it's&mdash;

 
**Scáthach:**
Heracles, the famed Greek myth hero!?

 
**Demon Boar:**
[[File:berserkervoice1.png50px]]&ndash;!!!

 
**Scáthach:**
A Berserker!
Looks like we don't have time for questions!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Master, get back!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Going up against a Servant who doesn't think with his head is my specialty!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
We can cook him well-done, or perhaps have him rare with wasabi and soy sauce!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Your head's mine!

 
**Demon Boar:**
...K-Kill...
I w-will... kill...

 
**Demon Boar:**
You...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Oh, I'm exhausted.
Master, Master. Care to massage me?♪

 
**Scáthach:**
Quite persistent, wasn't it. It was on a completely different level than the other demon boars we've met so far.

 
**Scáthach:**
Just like the giant demon boars from the other island,
it was a monster that reached the level of a Phantasmal.

 
**Scáthach:**
Normally it should only be found on the reverse side of the world, or it would have long been extinct.

 
**Scáthach:**
But it's here in this world, and it's building strength.

 
**Mash:**
...Is it possible that this island is isolated from everywhere else?

 
**Scáthach:**
There are plenty of heroes who have seen the whole world.

 
**Scáthach:**
And a greedy mage would never ignore a land with demonic beasts of this rank wandering around.

 
**Scáthach:**
...In that case, the possibilities are narrowed down for us. Now, let's walk a bit further.

 
**Mash:**
Wait a second.
The demon boar was protecting this tree.

 
**Mash:**
Shouldn't we investigate it before we&mdash;

 
**Scáthach:**
There's no need.
That's an ash tree.

 
**Mash:**
...What?

 
**Scáthach:**
Now let's go.
If it's still intact, it shouldn't have weathered away.

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, that's me!?

 
**Mash:**
This is the statue that Mordred put up on the last island!

 
**Scáthach:**
Seeing it wasting away like this makes you think about how all things eventually pass on.

 
**Scáthach:**
How utterly terrifying.
It's going to give me nightmares.

 
**Mordred:**
My statue...
WAAAAH! Master!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay. There, there.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Wait a minute...

 
**Mash:**
This old, broken stone statue is the one we built on the other island, right!?

 
**Fou:**
Fou...?

 
**Marie:**
...Oh!
I get it now!

 
**Scáthach:**
Well done. You are quick on the uptake, Marie.

 
**Scáthach:**
Mash, this isn't an inextricable mystery.
Everything is quite simple and obvious.

 
**Scáthach:**
Considering the state this statue is in, one thing is perfectly clear: this is the same island as before.

 
**Mash:**
...Oh, of course!

 
**Scáthach:**
We set sail and continued along a straight course, but ended up back where we started.

 
**Scáthach:**
Not only that, but time here passed at an incredible rate while we were gone.

 
**Scáthach:**
And so when we, oblivious to all that, returned to this place...

 
**Scáthach:**
...little did we know that some 2,000 years had already passed.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
2&mdash;

 
**Mash:**
2,000 years!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why weren't we affected?
 
**Scáthach:**
This island is special.
Time doesn't progress normally here.

 
**Scáthach:**
Even if you spend a year on this island, only a fraction of that time passes in the outside world&ndash;that is, everywhere but here.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
How do we get out of here?
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes, the first thing to consider is a means to escape safely. As expected from our Master.

 
**Scáthach:**
It's true that we've solved the mystery of this island, but as to how we escape it...

 
**Scáthach:**
Well, I'm sure it'll be fine. We'll find a way out as we solve more mysteries.

 

 
**Scáthach:**
At any rate, this world has been cut off from “our world” for 2,000 years now.

 
**Scáthach:**
No heroes or mages existed here.

 
**Scáthach:**
It was just a world where the boar piglets lived in peace.

 
**Scáthach:**
But then the intruders came.

 
**Mash:**
That would be us...

 
**Scáthach:**
Correct.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I see.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
We lived on that island and established a civilization, and so the boar piglets awakened to that concept as well.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
...However, isn't their civilization a little too advanced?

 
**Scáthach:**
It is, yes. That's also something worth thinking about...

 
**Scáthach:**
Anyway, over the course of 2,000 years, the boar piglets built up an advanced civilization on this island.

 
**Scáthach:**
They must have taken good care of that statue too.
We built it, after all.

 
**Marie:**
They worked so hard!
I'll have to praise them later!

 
**Mash:**
If Marie praises them, I am sure they will all be quite pleased.

 
**Fou:**
Fou fou.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Fou always manages to give us courage.

 
**Fou:**
Foumu.

 
**Scáthach:**
Okay, let's head back for now. We need to consider what to do next in the face of these facts.

 
## Section 3: "I'm Back, I'm Home" (2/2) (Tamamo-no-Mae)
 
**Mash:**
It seems demon boars aren't the only enemies here.

 
**Scáthach:**
This doesn't look like the work of a demon boar. The piglets may have made them for protection...either for themselves or for others.

 
**Scáthach:**
At any rate, it seems their creations weren't enough to defeat the demon boars.

 
**Scáthach:**
And there were automata lying on the ground besides the ones we defeated.

 
**Marie:**
They felt powerful enough to me just now...

 
**Marie:**
If nothing else, they seem stronger than the demon boars we fought.

Th-That's me!
That thing's supposed to be me, right!?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Waaaaaaaah! Half of my body is all buried!

 
**Mordred:**
Ahahahahahahaha!
What the hell is that, hahahaha!

Huh? Wait a minute...

If Marie praises them, I am sure they will all be quite pleased.

 
**Fou:**
Fou fou.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Fou always manages to give us courage.

 
**Fou:**
Foumu.

 
**Scáthach:**
Okay, let's head back for now. We need to consider what to do next in the face of these facts.

 
## Section 4: "Live Strong, Lancer"
 
**Martha:**
It's the same island from before!?

 
**Altria:**
This is what that thriving place has become!?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We found our old stone statue.

 
**Scáthach:**
Its presence here is proof enough that the two islands are one and the same... And one more thing.

 
**Scáthach:**
Remember the ash tree that the demon boar was guarding? I planted it.

 
**Mash:**
Right. Didn't you say it grows by absorbing poison?

 
**Scáthach:**
With no more poison in its soil, this island must have become a perfect habitat for the boar piglets.

 
**Mary:**
I see. So the nine goddesses they were talking about, the Nine Sisters... That must refer to us.

 
**Mary:**
We are... goddesses...

 
**Anne:**
This is all too much...
A simple pirate like me cannot keep up...

 
**Boar Piglet:**
So, they are the goddesses, yup?

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
That seems to be the case.
I'm quite surprised.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Very surprised, yup.

 
**Mash:**
But assuming this is the island from before...

 
**Scáthach:**
Boarding the ship again and leaving wouldn't be a smart option.

 
**Scáthach:**
The next time we land, a couple thousand years may have passed and the boar piglets may have gone extinct.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Oooiiik!

 
**Marie:**
Everything's going to be okay.
Don't worry. There, there.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou, fou!

 
**Mash:**
There's a real sense of rivalry here!
It's making Fou tremble!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Miss Scáthach, I have a question.

 
**Scáthach:**
What is it, Kiyohime?

 
**Kiyohime:**
You say this island has neither heroes nor mages...

 
**Kiyohime:**
...and that if we spend a year on it, time barely passes elsewhere.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Which all means that on this island...

 
**Kiyohime:**
MASTER AND I CAN BE ADAM AND EVE, RIGHT!?

 
**Scáthach:**
...As long as it's consensual.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hey, what!?
 
**Kiyohime:**
My darling!

 
**Kiyohime:**
We have Scáthach's approval.
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve!

 
**Mordred:**
Calm the freak down!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Pooh.

 
**Mordred:**
That was a close one, Master.

 
**Altria:**
(You shouldn't really use Prydwen to hit people...)

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Don't tell Kiyohime that!
 
**Kiyohime:**
Agree to it, Master!
Give me your consent!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Let's cuddle forever on this island removed from the cycle of reincarnation!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Frozen Heaven!

 
**Kiyohime:**
So cold!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
(Sigh) Are you all right, Master?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It seems the only thing that interests Kiyohime here is being able to cuddle for all eternity.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Let's leave her alone for now.

 

 
**Martha:**
So? What do we do now?

 
**Scáthach:**
We need to solve the island's mystery.
Otherwise we'll really end up as Adam and Eve.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I am an Eve too...
 
**Scáthach:**
Hah, don't worry. In case of an emergency, I can use my runes.

 
**Mash:**
Y-You can!?

 
**Fou:**
Fou-rune!?

 

 
**Mordred:**
...Stop acting like a buffoon.
Let's continue the conversation.

 
**Mordred:**
So what's the big mystery here?

 
**Scáthach:**
First, we need to find a way to get off this island. Second, we need to find the reason behind its isolation.

 
**Scáthach:**
To solve the former, we need to restore civilization here.

 
**Scáthach:**
With technology, it may be possible for us to make contact with Chaldea.

 
**Scáthach:**
As well as escape from this enclosed world.

 
**Scáthach:**
To solve the latter, we just need to explore more.

 
**Marie:**
We also need to eradicate the demon boars.

 
**Scáthach:**
We have a lot to do, and not so much time to do it.

 
**Scáthach:**
We need to deal with this during the course of one summer. Got it!?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Goddess!

 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm? What's wrong?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
A Servant has come to visit!
What shall we do?

 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, a Servant...

 
**All:**
What!?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
(Panting) What an awful experience...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Big Bro Cú Chulainn!?
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Yo. Before I knew it, I was washed up on the shore. Thought I was a goner!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're alive!?
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I'm alive!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, when a huge wave swept me away, I thought I was a goner!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I conserved my energy by dog-paddling!
Humans can do anything when they put their minds to it!

 

 
**Scáthach:**
My pupil, you are amazingly tough.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Hah, hah, hah!
No need to praise me.

 
**Scáthach:**
I underestimated you.
You've grown far stronger than I expected.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
... (Mikon!)

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
You certainly have.
You truly are Ireland's Child of Light.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
No doubt the hearts of the lady Servants are fluttering at your manliness♪

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Oh, hah! You think so!?
After a long wait, maybe it'll finally be my time!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Alter, Caster... Those are just cheap knockoffs!
Lancer is what it's all about!

 
**Marie:**
Cú Chulainn, you're so cool!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Wow, so cool!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Aha hah hah!

 
**Scáthach:**
So, we'll have you fight on the front lines!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Yes, ma'am!
&mdash;So what do I do?

 
**Altria:**
...Lancer...

 
**Scáthach:**
Relax, my dear pupil.

 
**Scáthach:**
It's an easy job anyone can do.
And your colleagues are all very friendly.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
There's clearly something sinister in this proposition.

 
**Scáthach:**
Don't worry.
I have faith in you.

 
**Scáthach:**
Go and hunt 100 demon boars.
Some of them are huge. Good luck.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You monster!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Cú Chulainn, we believe in you.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You damn fox...!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Kon, kon♡

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Regrettably, that's so cute!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Tehehe, thank you, Master!

 
**Both:**
...

 
**Scáthach:**
Don't worry too much.
The Master will help you out.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's work together!
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
U-Ugh... Whatever. All right, all right! I'll do it!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm with you.
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Hah, thanks.
You have it pretty hard, don't you?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Okay, let's do this together!

 

 
**Mash:**
...And that's what we know.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I see. So this is the island from before.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...By the way, I have a question.

 
**Mash:**
Yes?

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
What was this island originally like?

 
**Mash:**
Oh, uh, who knows...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Oh, sorry. It just kind of bothered me.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Anyway, 100 demon boars?
If we don't watch out, we won't be done by tonight!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
If that's the case, we're gonna camp outdoors!

 
**Mash:**
L-Let's give it our best, Senpai!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Ugh, what a pain.
But I guess we're done for the most part, right?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, just one more.
...We have defeated 99 of them.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
That's nothin'! I'm already used to Scáthach's unreasonable demands.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Alright, let's finish off the last one!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
It's huge!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
This is on the same level as the legendary demonic beast that killed Diarmuid!

 
**Mash:**
Yes! Scáthach estimates that it has ascended to the level of a Phantasmal!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Ugh, that devilish mentor of mine...
Throws in a real doozy right at the very end...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Ah, whatever. Guess those 99 were a warm-up.
Time to get serious for the last one!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Tch, damn you! You're more persistent than some low-rarity Servants!

 
**Fou:**
Fou...!?

 
**Mash:**
...Fou?

 
**G：???:**
...I'll be taking that!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
What...!?

 
**Beowulf:**
My bad, but don't hate me for it.

 
**Mash:**
He took down that tenacious beast like it was nothing!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, can't say I'm surprised.
Hey, Beowulf, stop taking other people's prey.

 
**Beowulf:**
Sorry, gotta keep myself and my underlings fed.

 
**Beowulf:**
Honestly, feeding demon boars the meat of their own kind... Talk about cannibalistic!

 
**Mash:**
W-Wait a second!
Demon boars are your underlings?

 
**Beowulf:**
Gahahahaha!
This fist of mine can be quite convincing!

 
**Beowulf:**
Welcome to the post-apocalyptic world! So I've tamed the demon boars... No need to be that surprised, surely!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
...You seem a lot more energetic than usual.

 
**Beowulf:**
Why wouldn't I be!?
I am the ruler of a nation!

 
**Beowulf:**
For my people, it's survival of the fittest: the strong eat, the weak become food!

 
**Mash:**
S-So you really are going to eat that boar...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You need to have some veggies too...
 
**Beowulf:**
Whad'ya say? Protein's the best!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's not healthy.
 
**Beowulf:**
Doesn't matter.
A Servant's very existence is unhealthy.

 

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Well, you do have a point there.
...So are you our enemy? Or are you our foe?

 
**Beowulf:**
I'm obviously not your ally! I don't know if it's the influence of poison or alcohol, but...

 
**Beowulf:**
I am itching to take over this world!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Take over this world?

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Beowulf:**
Anyway, I'll grab my prey and take my leave!
Don't want this meat to rot!

 
**Beowulf:**
Fwahahaha! If you want your meat back, come round to my neck of the woods!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Argh...looks like we got careless at the end.

 
**Mash:**
...This is bad, right?

 
**Mash:**
Not only are demon boars wandering about, but Beowulf is leading them...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
What a nightmare...
Either way, we are done here.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Let's go back and eat. All that hunting has made me hungry... Just like a human.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, let's head back for now.

 
**Mash:**
Demon boars, the mysterious civilization of the boar piglets, the fact that we can't Rayshift...

 
**Mash:**
And now, the appearance of a hostile Servant...
Master, I wonder what will happen next.

 
**Mordred:**
Beowulf!? Even that thug is here!?

 
**Mordred:**
Dammit, I wish I'd been there with you guys!

 
**Altria:**
(You are just as much a thug as him, Sir Mordred.)

 
**Mary:**
And he's an enemy.

 
**Martha:**
Well, he's got a post-apocalyptic villain look to him.
That basta&mdash; Ahem...

 
**Martha:**
I mean, eventually he shall become an enemy we have to face.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Give him a taste of your Fist of Martha.
 
**Martha:**
Right. The time has come at last to unleash my family's secret technique.

 
**Martha:**
...Hey! What are you trying to make me do!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Hey, Boss! Let's make him pay!
 
**Martha:**
Damn right! If he picks a fight with me, I'll make him pay 10,000 times over!

 
**Martha:**
...

 
**Martha:**
...Master, what are you making me say!?

 

 
**Mash:**
Martha, you're going to pull Senpai's cheeks right off if you keep that up...

 
**Scáthach:**
The Beowulf problem aside,
I have something else to report.

 
**Mash:**
What would that be?

 
**Scáthach:**
While you were hunting the demon boars, we explored this island to gather more information.

 
**Scáthach:**
There's something that caught my attention...

 
**Mash:**
Yes? And that would that be?

 
## Section 5: "Lion King (TBD)"
 
**Mash:**
Senpai. We have visited all kinds of places and eras in order to repair humanity.

 
**Mash:**
On the previous island, we even built various structures just to survive...

 
**Mash:**
But even then, I never thought we would end up building something like this...

 
**Mash:**
This is too much of a new experience.

 
**Scáthach:**
...To help the boar piglets, we're building all kinds of things...

 
**Scáthach:**
Convenience stores, power plants, used book store, condominiums, burger shops...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What the heck are we doing?
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, please don't say that.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
To save humanity...
 
**Mash:**
...I guess each little step counts...

 

 
**Scáthach:**
But what I've noticed is that civilization is blooming a little too smoothly.

 
**Scáthach:**
Even with our help,
something is off with the rate of growth.

 
**Scáthach:**
So I asked the boar piglet chief whether there are any old folk tales besides the one about the Nine Goddesses...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
According to legend, about 100 or so years ago, a Servant who claimed to be a mage gave us electricity.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Electronics, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Electric buzzing!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Slippery eels, yup!

 
**Mordred:**
Unlike Gramps here, you guys just seem to be saying whatever pops into your head...

 
**Boar Piglet:**
In the end, we are mere boar piglets.
We're like bots, yup.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Please do not be concerned, yup.

 
**Mary:**
A mage... Probably a Caster.
So a Caster gave you all electricity, huh...

 
**Mary:**
Well, if this all happened more than a century ago,
I suppose they'd be long dead by now.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
This is also according to legend...

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
“I shall sleep now in preparation for the eventual arrival of my comrades. Wake me up if something happens, 'kay?”

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Those were the mage's final words before disappearing into the depths of a large cave on this island.

 
**Scáthach:**
...There you have it. I am thinking about heading to that cave tomorrow. What say you, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I will go with you.
 
**Scáthach:**
Understood. I also want you to discern the nature of that Servant with your own eyes.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can I come along?
 
**Mash:**
If that's the case, then I'd like to go too!

 

 
**Scáthach:**
That settles it. Next&mdash;

 
**Altria:**
I, too, shall accompany you.

 
**Mordred:**
...Fine. If King Arthur is going, I guess I have no choice but to go.

 
**Scáthach:**
...V-Very well.
I have my worries, but let's go with this party.

 
**Scáthach:**
Everyone else, continue to work on the defenses and the other construction projects. Dismissed!

 
**Altria:**
But what about that Servant in the legend?
Could they survive for more than a century?

 
**Scáthach:**
If this were a normal place, probably not.
But this island doesn't seem to follow the laws of time.

 
**Scáthach:**
If they possess Independent Action and can act without a Master, then yes, it might very well be possible. With a little effort.

 
**Altria:**
We are approaching the cave the boar piglet chief mentioned, but...

 
**Altria:**
Before that, it is probably best to clear the demon boars wandering around.

 
**Altria:**
Let's go, Master!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
There are demon boars here too.
And they're huge.

 
**Altria:**
Everyone, make sure Beowulf doesn't steal any of our meat this time!

 
**Altria:**
MAKE SURE OF IT!

 
**Mordred:**
Father, you're too worked up...

 
**Mash:**
W-Well.
Let's do our best, everyone!

 
**Mordred:**
Ugh... Such a goody two-shoes...

 
**Altria:**
She's nothing of the sort.
Mash just genuinely has a pure and kind heart.

 
**Altria:**
She is like natural, pristine water.

 
**Altria:**
You, on the other hand, are a cheap, chaotic cocktail of cola, sugar, cream, and churros.

 
**Mordred:**
Hey, that's not even a drink anymore!
That's a Devil's Chocolate Sundae!

 
**Mash:**
C-Calm down, you two.

 
**Scáthach:**
Chaos isn't all bad; in fact, it's downright necessary when an era has come to a standstill.

 
**Altria:**
It's a different story in times of war, though: Chaos begets evil then. Order is what's needed instead.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Umm, everyone...

 
**Scáthach:**
But an age of perfect order is insipid and dull.
Also, what's seen as good and evil changes over time.

 
**Mordred:**
Right, exactly!
That's why I'm not wrong at all!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hellooo...

 
**Altria:**
However, there is an established concept of good. Always. At least that is what I believe.

 
**Scáthach:**
“Established”? Don't you mean “assumed”?

 
**Mordred:**
Wasn't it your stiff thinking that made that dolt Lancelot cause so much trouble?

 
**Mash:**
Mordred, shush!
Don't say that!

 
**Fou:**
Fou fooou!

 
**Demon Boar:**
(How long is this going to go on?)

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry, let's get ready!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Altria:**
I apologize for getting so worked up earlier.

 
**Scáthach:**
No, it's I who must apologize for my ill-mannered behavior towards a king.

 
**Mordred:**
I didn't do anything wrong!

 
**Mash:**
Oh please, Mordred...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yeah, Mordred didn't do anything wrong.
 
**Mordred:**
Huh? What're you talking about? I did everything wrong!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Right. Yep, you're right.
 
**Mordred:**
Wh-What's with that look?
Sheesh. Fine, it was my bad!

 

 
**Mordred:**
I'm sorry!

 
**Mash:**
(...Ah, I get it...)

 
**Fou:**
Fou fou.

 
**Altria:**
...Anyway, let's move on. Mordred, as punishment you will do 100,000 pushups as soon as we get back.

 
**Mordred:**
Yes, my lord!
Hooray, that's 900,000 less than usual!

 
**Fou:**
Fou, fou.

 
**Scáthach:**
Hm? An...earthquake?

 
**Mash:**
The earth is shaking.
This is&mdash;

 
**Mordred:**
Wh-What the heck is this music!?

 
**Mash:**
Is it...a gramophone!?

 
**???:**
Hah hah hah!
Hah hah hah!

 
**???:**
Fwahah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!

 
**Mash:**
This laugh... It's almost like this person practiced and perfected their laugh for this exact moment!

 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm, I feel like I have heard it somewhere before...!

 
**Altria:**
Who goes there? Show yourself!

 
**???:**
Hah. I would very much like to show myself to you all!

 
**???:**
However, I must confirm whether you are the ones I was waiting for!

 
**???:**
Witness in awe the strength of this great king!

 
**Mash:**
Detecting an unknown Servant and multiple enemies around us! Let's go!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**???:**
Fantastic! What a wonderful display of strength! Although I would say strength isn't everything!

 
**???:**
Anyway, having gotten an idea of your true ability, I suppose there's no harm in revealing myself to you now!

 
**Scáthach:**
Enough talk, just come out already.

 
**???:**
Servants, how I waited for this moment!
Now I shall bestow my wisdom upon you!

 
**???:**
I am a Caster.
People call me the Wizard of Menlo Park!

 
**Mash:**
The Wizard of Menlo Park... I knew it!

 
**Edison:**
I am Thomas Alva Edison, the Presi-king!!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh man, here we go again...
 
**Mash:**
It's all clear now. If this man sets his mind to it, civilization would indeed develop at a very rapid pace...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So it wasn't Tesla.
 
**Edison:**
 
No, Master!!

 
**Edison:**
There is no way a ruffian like that could help the boar piglets evolve properly!

 
**Edison:**
They were successful because of me!
It is important you understand! Attention!

 

 
**Altria:**
(A lion...fluffy...bushy mane...fluffy)

 
**Mordred:**
(Father's giving him a sharp look... I get it.
Being on guard in front of a fellow king! Impressive, Father!)

 
**Edison:**
Well then, what has become of the boar piglets' civilization?

 
**Edison:**
I reckon they've reached a level at which they can casually exchange high-speed communications with the outside world!

 
**Scáthach:**
It's in ruins.

 
**Edison:**
Nooooooooooooooooooo!!!

 
**Edison:**
I-It really is destroyed!
Welcome to a crazy time, eh!?

 
**Edison:**
Oh, how terrible! Even after I had passed all my modern knowledge on to them!

 
**Mash:**
It must be rough on you...

 
**Edison:**
To think those monstrous demon boars would reduce it to rubble... I'll never forgive them!

 
**Edison:**
I'll send every single one of them to the meatpacking factory and end world hunger!

 
**Mordred:**
The heck!? He's so scary!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Scáthach:**
It's frightening to know that you are quite capable of doing so. Anyway, Edison, I'm amazed you're alive.

 
**Edison:**
Yes. My deep insight allowed me to predict that in 100 years, you Nine Sisters would come here...

 
**Edison:**
And that you would need my help to escape this island.

 
**Edison:**
Thus, by utilizing all the available technology at that time...

 
**Edison:**
I completed the Edison Cryosleep Device, set the Edison Gramophone Alarm Clock,

 
**Edison:**
and waited until my awakening!!

 
**Mash:**
So you hibernated.

 
**Edison:**
Cryosleep! I was in cryosleep!

 
**Altria:**
I understand the big picture now.

 
**Altria:**
However, it is quite difficult to believe you are Edison. Your look differs from the pictures we have seen.

 
**Edison:**
Humph. I get that quite often.
But it's true: I am, in fact, Edison.

 
**Mordred:**
(Father tries to confirm everything personally.
As expected...)

 
**Altria:**
Allow me to confirm. Hmm. (Snuggle, squeeze)

 
**Edison:**
Oomph, I didn't expect my face to be pulled...
Ah, oww, that hurts! Wait!

 
**Altria:**
(Snuggle, snuggle, squeeze, squeeze, snuggle, snuggle, squeeze, squeeze, snuggle, snuggle, squeeze, squeeze)

 
**Edison:**
Stop, stop, you're pulling my fur out!

 
**Mash:**
Altria, you are going too far!
S-Someone stop her!

 
**Mordred:**
(Wow, Father...!)

 
**Edison:**
Hah hah hah! We meet again, my friends!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Salute!

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
So he's the Lion Ki&ndash;

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Don't finish that sentence, yup.

 
**Edison:**
Hah hah! I see you're as incoherent as ever!

 
**Edison:**
Well, what shall I build you?
I have the power to build anything and everything!

 
**Scáthach:**
Actually, first off, we will have you find a way for us to return to Chaldea.

 
**Edison:**
Right! But I need a certain item for that purpose!

 
**Mash:**
A certain item?

 
**Edison:**
Nothing special. Most of you should have it in your possession.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What is it?

 
**Edison:**
Yes... It is somewhere on this island...

 
**Edison:**
The Holy Grail!

 
**Mash:**
The Holy Grail...!?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!!

 
## Section 6: "The Mechanical Beast Roars"
 
**Edison:**
The Holy Grail!

 
**Mash:**
The Holy Grail...!?

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
That's what happened in the last episode, yup!

 
**B：Boar Piglet:**
A lot happened during that time!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
But we omitted most of the details, yup!

 
**Scáthach:**
Hmm, the Holy Grail, huh?
What a tall order...

 
**Edison:**
Huh? You don't have it with you?

 
**Altria:**
It's not something you can just carry around.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
It's supposed to be a precious object one can only obtain at the end of a long, grueling Holy Grail War.

 
**Edison:**
Hmm, this is problematic.

 
**Edison:**
Without the vast magical energy that it possesses, we won't be able to establish communication with Chaldea...

 
**Scáthach:**
Is there a Holy Grail somewhere on this island?

 
**Edison:**
Yes! No doubt about it!

 
**Edison:**
However, I don't know who has it.
It's either with a Servant somewhere or...

 
**Boar Piglet:**
The Holy Grail!

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Only one group survives, yup!

 
**B：Boar Piglet:**
That's deflation, yup.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
In a way, it's inflation, too, yup.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Be quiet for a bit, younglings.
We don't have any information on the Holy Grail.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
If we had something amazing like that, we would've used it long ago.

 
**Edison:**
Yes, I imagine you would have used it to get rid of the demon boars.

 
**Scáthach:**
...Which means it's safe to say that the demon boars themselves have it.

 
**Scáthach:**
50 years ago, demon boars suddenly appeared in great numbers. We can assume it had something to do with the Holy Grail.

 
**Edison:**
That is indeed logical!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But the question is, which demon boar has it?

 
**Anne:**
I suppose we'll just have to search all of them, one boar at a time.

 
**Mary:**
What a pain.

 
**Kiyohime:**
You must start small and chip away diligently.

 
**Kiyohime:**
In fact, I've been sneaking into your room and doing just that, Master. All in order to conquer you in bed.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Every night...
 
**Mary:**
Now, now. Calm down, Master.

 
**Mary:**
Don't worry. I'll protect your bed.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Hmmm...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
That's no small start, that's the finish line.
 
**Kiyohime:**
Not at all, Master. Why, even dying together would only be the halfway point...

 
**Kiyohime:**
After that, we will reincarnate again and again, holding on to our memories, and we shall witness the extinction of the cosmos together. That would be the end.

 
**Martha:**
(Sheesh. There's no such thing as reincarnation, but I'll let that go. Objecting would overcomplicate things.)

 

 
**Scáthach:**
Anyway, I have some idea where the demon boars' lair might be.

 
**Scáthach:**
I expect they'll have a large army, so we should make careful preparations. Then we all head out together.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Well, isn't this a crowd...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
That's fine, but how long are all of you going to remain in swimsuits? ...Hey, don't turn away.

 
**Scáthach:**
&mdash;Anyway, come, let's prepare (read: charge into battle).

 
**Kiyohime:**
Umm... I feel like someone mistyped the text...

 
**Scáthach:**
No, that was correct. I am asking everyone to get ready (read: leave no survivors).

 
**Scáthach:**
All right, who will go first?

 
**Scáthach:**
For me, a battle royale between everyone would be ideal...

 
**Mash:**
...Let's go in order.
All right, let the training begin!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Why...did I get roped into this...?

 
**Edison:**
Never mind you. I don't have anything to do with this. Urgh.

 
**Scáthach:**
All right, now that Edison has warmed up with some light exercise too, shall we be off?

 
**Altria:**
Yes!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Hey, old man lion.
Time to go.

 
**Edison:**
This kind of exercise is too hard for someone with E-rank strength...

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
But you've got such a fine physique...

 
**Edison:**
I'm more brains than brawn, after all!

 
**Scáthach:**
...Hmm.

 
**Mash:**
This is...

 
**Altria:**
Scáthach. It seems your speculation was correct.

 
**Altria:**
There are too many of them.
It is solid proof that something must lie ahead.

 
**Scáthach:**
Indeed. However, our number puts us at a disadvantage out here in the open.

 
**Mordred:**
Hah! This is easy.

 
**Mordred:**
I'll charge and tear into their front lines, giving time for Master and Mash to slip through.

 
**Mordred:**
Everyone else just needs to beat down whatever's left. Simple as that!

 
**Altria:**
Let's go with Mordred's plan.
Scáthach, please go with them.

 
**Scáthach:**
Anyone else?

 
**Kiyohime:**
It pains me to be separated from my Master, but we have no choice.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Listen, when you get back, you better spend all your time with me!

 
**Mary:**
Aye, I understand my role. Don't worry, I was good at buying time even when I was alive.

 
**Anne:**
That's right. Besides, it doesn't look like anyone here would run away from a fight, so that's reassuring.

 
**Martha:**
Yes. We'll make all these demon boars here repent for their sins, so you two just go on ahead.

 
**Marie:**
Exactly. Fujimaru, Mash... Give it all you've got! Do it for those adorable little piglets!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Well, defensive battles aren't really my forte, but...
Okay, fine! Truly shining at times like this is what being a stunning woman is all about!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
So, Master.
Go pulverize them!

 
**Mordred:**
Come on, there's nothing to worry about! If that idiotic&ndash;I mean, if Lady Scáthach is with you then everything will be fine!

 
**Mordred:**
(That was a close one! Too close!)

 
**Scáthach:**
(No, it most certainly was not.)

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
I feel like I drew the short end of the stick on this island! Ah, well...
Let's do this!

 
**Edison:**
I shall accompany you. I don't think I have anything useful to add to that lineup.

 
**Edison:**
Instead, I'll be more helpful in the search for the Holy Grail!

 
**Mordred:**
All right, then it's settled!
Let me break through with my Noble Phantasm!

 
**Mordred:**
Noble Phantasm deployed... “Prydwen Tube Riding”!

 
**Mordred:**
Yes! I opened a path!

 
**Altria:**
Go ahead, Master!
We'll take care of the horde!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's charge!
 
**Mash:**
Roger that, Master!
Mash Kyrielight, rushing into the fray!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Thank you, everyone!
 
**Mordred:**
No thanks necessary!
Now get going!

 
**Martha:**
Give them hell!

 

 
**Scáthach:**
All right, let's keep moving ahead!

 
**Mash:**
I hear the sound of Noble Phantasms firing off behind us!

 
**Edison:**
Which means they're pulling out all the stops! (Panting)

 
**Scáthach:**
Edison, you're falling behind.

 
**Edison:**
S-Sorry.
I've got E-rank agility too!

 
**Mash:**
I thought your endurance was EX.

 
**Edison:**
That EX rank refers to my ability to go sleepless for days while working on an invention!

 
**Scáthach:**
In other words, you don't have the physical strength to run a marathon! Anyway, hurry!

 
**Edison:**
I-I'm trying! (Panting)

 
**Edison:**
Damn it! Next time I will invent a powered exoskeleton to assist people with weak stamina!

 
**Scáthach:**
It's a giant demon boar! We'd better slay it swiftly!
We don't have time for a drawn-out battle!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mash:**
...Where are we?

 
**Edison:**
The odor of oil, steel, and adhesive...
Without a doubt, this place is a factory!

 
**Edison:**
But what are they building here?

 
**C：???:**
...Me.

 
**Scáthach:**
...Who goes there?

 
**C：???:**
It's been a while.

 
**C：???:**
...No, I am sure it's only been an instant to you vermin.

 
**C：???:**
However, to me, it's been hell.

 
**Mash:**
Huh? Altria!?

 
**Edison:**
...No. She smells like oil and steel too.

 
**Edison:**
King Arthur wouldn't give off a modern odor like that.

 
**C：Altria?:**
...You are correct.

 
**C：Altria?:**
This is a form I plan to use when I destroy those boars.

 
**C：Altria?:**
They will welcome me as their savior, obey my every word... and then accept their own destruction with joy.

 
**C：Altria?:**
Vengeance... Vengeance 2,000 years in the making will come to fruition here.

 
**Scáthach:**
...I see. So that's who you are.

 
**Scáthach:**
You're the demon boar we defeated 2,000 years ago, aren't you?

 
**Mash:**
...The very first giant demon boar!

 
**Edison:**
So, eons ago, these people vanquished you and put an end to your dastardly deeds...

 
**Edison:**
But you managed to survive and have been biding your time ever since, plotting your revenge...

 
**Scáthach:**
It's been too long. If that much time has passed,
you are&mdash;

 
**C：Altria?:**
That's right, I am like you.
However, I have reached the realm of a divine beast.

 
**Mash:**
D-Divine beast!?

 
**Scáthach:**
It's nothing to be surprised about.

 
**Scáthach:**
On this land overflowing with magical energy, he used the Holy Grail to survive for 2,000 years.

 
**Scáthach:**
It's entirely possible that he did, in fact, attain divine beast status.

 
**Scáthach:**
He's taken this form in retaliation against the person who defeated him long ago. Isn't that right,
Twrch Trwyth!?

 
**Mash:**
Twrch Trwyth!?
From King Arthur's legends?

 
**Scáthach:**
Yes, the King of Demon Boars. One who transformed into a boar and ate his way across Britain with his seven piglets.

 
**Scáthach:**
Hmph. To think you drifted all the way to a land like this...

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
...I was once defeated by Arthur, King of Knights.
But that brat did not consider me a formidable enemy.

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
He should have treated me like a fellow king... But no!

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
It's like I was a mere rodent to him the entire time!
He bested me and drove me right out of the realm!

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
All just to save the suffering, and to retrieve my giant razor, scissors, and comb!

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
I could never forget such humiliation, even after 2,000 or even 3,000 years!

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
I wandered all over and finally ended up on this island.
I embraced the Holy Grail and, by doing so, became a behemoth fit to be a divine beast.

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
In other words, I became Twrch Trwyth...!!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A mecha!
 
**Edison:**
Good god! He survived for 2,000 years by turning himself into a machine!?

 
**Edison:**
Using the power of the Holy Grail, he forced himself to live even when he was supposed to be destroyed...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Is he even alive?
 
**Scáthach:**
Half alive and half dead.

 
**Scáthach:**
His death-like visage comes from his attachment to living. He has fallen into the oblivion between both.

 
**Scáthach:**
Either way, I never thought I would encounter a legendary demonic beast in a place like this!

 

 
**Mash:**
We will not let you disrupt the lives of the boar piglets. We will defeat you, right here, right now!

 
**Mash:**
Let's go, Master!
Your orders, please!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
...My seven sons.
...My glory. My kingdom. My people.

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
Everything... Everything is gone.
Even my body.

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
I've come all this way.
I've made it this far.

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
So then why must I&mdash;

 
**Scáthach:**
It's simple.
It is your fate.

 
**Scáthach:**
You rampaged, stole, devoured, killed, gloated, and had your way with everything.

 
**Scáthach:**
Even after being punished and turned into a boar, that didn't change at all.

 
**Scáthach:**
...So it's only natural that you'd be trapped here for 2,000 years. Just as it's only natural that you'd die here too.

 
**Scáthach:**
That was your fate from the moment you first decided to steal.

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
...

 
**Scáthach:**
Do not hate us, Twrch Trwyth! That would be a pathetic end for one who became a divine beast.

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
I see... Now that you mention it... Looking back...

 
**Twrch Trwyth:**
I suppose it was... only natural.

 
**Mash:**
Master, it's gone.
We've won.

 
**Mash:**
And the Holy Grail has manifested as well.
Let me get it.

 
**Scáthach:**
We can use this power to finally leave.

 
**Edison:**
Yes. Leave the rest to me.
I'll take care of everything!

 
**Fou:**
Fou?

 
**Edison:**
D-Don't worry, Fou. It's okay.
I won't use it for any strange inventions!

 
**Mash:**
...I have a feeling we should keep an eye on Edison.

 
## Section 7: "Is There Anything You've Forgotten?"
 
**Altria:**
...I can't believe it.

 
**Altria:**
To think that Twrch Trwyth was the cause of all this...

 
**Altria:**
I'm sorry, little piglets.
This is all my fault.

 
**Scáthach:**
No, it's not.

 
**Scáthach:**
Still, I wonder what kind of miracle it took for him to survive and end up on this island.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Don't worry about it, yup!

 
**Boar Piglet:**
We can probably attribute the advanced technology of the mecha-demon boar to our ancestors, yup.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Why don't we split the blame 50-50 and call it even, yup?

 
**Altria:**
I'm not sure if that made me feel better or not...

 
**Scáthach:**
Well, what matters is that it's all over.
We've got good news from Edison.

 
**Edison:**
Indeed! ...I've completed our escape device.

 
**Edison:**
According to my calculations, this should make it possible to contact Chaldea.

 
**B：All:**
Yay!

 
**Kojirou:**
Wow, what a happy ending.

 
**Karna:**
Escape, huh?
Now this is what you'd call an emotional moment.

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
There's more of them, yup.

 
**B：Boar Piglet:**
Some of them just appeared out of nowhere.

 
**A：Boar Piglet:**
I'm sure they went through an epic tale that we will never know about, yup.

 
**Boar Piglets:**
I see!

 
**Mordred:**
Wait, where the heck were you guys?

 
**Kojirou:**
I was with Karna at Beowulf's place.

 
**Mordred:**
I see... Well, since the Master will be happy to know you're okay, I guess it's fine.

 
**Karna:**
But Master, is it okay for us to join you?

 
**Martha:**
There's no way we're leaving you.
Beowulf, you too.

 
**Beowulf:**
Glad to hear it!
As a way of saying thanks, I request a rematch.

 
**Martha:**
That's not how you say thanks!

 
**Edison:**
Now then. It's possible for us to leave immediately, but...

 
**Edison:**
There's probably some unfinished business here.

 
**Edison:**
You can feel sad about saying goodbye, or you can help improve the island.

 
**Edison:**
Let's enjoy our life here so we'll have no regrets!

 
**Scáthach:**
Oh, Master.
May I ask you something?

 
**Scáthach:**
I know this is sudden, but... what do you think of this swimsuit?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It looks good on you.
 
**Scáthach:**
...!

 
**Scáthach:**
I see.
If you think so, that makes me feel better.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You look pretty.
 
**Scáthach:**
Y-You're very straightforward!
Ahem.

 
**Scáthach:**
Well, that's fine.

 

 
**Scáthach:**
There's something I have to confess.
When I put this on, I altered my Spirit Origin, remember?

 
**Scáthach:**
...I forgot.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?

 
**Scáthach:**
I have COMPLETELY, 100% forgotten how to change it back!

 
**Scáthach:**
In other words, even after we go back, I'll still be wearing this swimsuit.

 
**Scáthach:**
But what you just said was reassuring.
If my Master says so, I have no choice.

 
**Scáthach:**
I'll fight in this outfit all year long!
...What? I'm a Servant, I don't catch colds.

 
**Scáthach:**
I'll fight like this in a blizzard!

 
**Scáthach:**
...What's wrong, Master? Your face is twitching.
You're happy, right? Right? Right?

 
**Scáthach:**
...Huh? What happens to the other Servants, you ask?

 
**Scáthach:**
Oh.

 
## Final Section: "Homecoming"
 
**Edison:**
...It's finally time to go!

 
**H：All:**
Yay!

 
**Edison:**
We'll depart once we confirm nothing has been left behind.

 
**Edison:**
After leaving the island, we'll be able to contact Chaldea and Rayshift back! ...Probably.

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
You've got to be more confident than that.

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Are you leaving, goddesses?

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Piglets, salute! Yup!

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
We'll miss you, yup...

 
**Marie:**
Sorry, guys.
But this time we really do have to go.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Everyone...
Thank you so much for saving our island.

 
**Mordred:**
Aww, it was nothin'! It was fun!

 
**Altria:**
Please build a lasting, peaceful country.

 
**Martha:**
If you get too arrogant, demon boars and whatnot will show up again.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
We'll remember that, Goddess of the Iron Fist.

 
**Martha:**
...Right. It's okay. I'm a grown-up, and I can handle an unreasonable nickname like that.

 
**Mary:**
I don't think it's unfair. I think it's dead-on.

 
**Martha:**
Shove it.

 
**Anne:**
Our fun vacation is over, huh?
I hope I didn't get fat from eating so much meat.

 
**Mary:**
Tch.

 
**Mash:**
I think I just heard the sound of a friendship collapsing.

 
**Mash:**
Goodbye, boar piglets.
Master, say something to them.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Be good now, okay?
 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Right!

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
We are all passengers on Spaceship Earth, yup!

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Love and peace!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Live in harmony with nature!
 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
I see! Harmony, yup!

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
I'm a naturalist, yup!

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
I'll sell some books about going green and leading a sustainable lifestyle! I'll live in comfort!

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
When are you guys going to grow up?
Well, thank you for your words.

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Fujimaru, you will someday be praised as the 10th [♂ god /♀ goddess].

 

 
**Boar Piglet Chief:**
Oh, Fujimaru, please let me take a picture. We'll make a huge statue for you.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
No thanks!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Scáthach:**
I suppose it's time to go...
My, everything looks so different.

 
**Altria:**
Hmm? There's still a lot of work to be done though.

 
**Scáthach:**
It's not that.

 
**Scáthach:**
What I mean is, something seems very different about this place to me. Both now and 2,000 years ago.

 
**Scáthach:**
Because...

 
**Edison:**
It's time go, everyone!

 
**Scáthach:**
This is the place I'm supposed to protect. In other words, it's the Land of Shadows, a part of the Isle of Skye.

 
**Scáthach:**
The Land of Shadows was caught up in the incineration of humanity as well, but for some reason, this island was cut off from that.

 
**Scáthach:**
What was it that brought those creatures here, and led them to build a civilization?

 
**Scáthach:**
What miracle was it that brought us here?

 
**Scáthach:**
This island is cut off from the rest of humanity. Never again will lost adventurers wind up here. We'll be the last.

 
**Scáthach:**
Will it become a paradise? Or will it revert to its true nature, the Land of Shadows, where death and darkness rule?

 
**Scáthach:**
...I suppose it'll all be okay if it's those easygoing boar piglets we're talking about. If it were humans living here, though, that'd be a different story.

 
**Scáthach:**
After all, the piglets never developed any weapons&ndash;regardless of how advanced their civilization became.

 
**Scáthach:**
As long as there are no foreign invaders lying in wait,
I'm sure they'll live in peace.

 
**Scáthach:**
...Don't tell the others, but just in case, I left an Oblivion Rune down there on the island.

 
**Scáthach:**
The boar piglets will someday forget their civilization, forget their language, and live an easy life as wild beasts.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Will they really be okay?
 
**Scáthach:**
...One can only hope.
That's something even I don't know the answer to.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Fingers crossed...
 
**Scáthach:**
If that's the way you feel, Master, then pray.
Your prayers will surely be heard.

 

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Huh?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Fujimaru! Mash!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
...Yes! The connection finally went through!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Looks like you fixed whatever was turning into a Singularity, too.

 
**Dr. Roman:**
Man, that was fast.
A new record, I bet!

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I'm bringing you back to Chaldea for now.
You guys ready?

 
**Mash:**
Yes, Doctor!

 
**Mash:**
By the way, how many days has it been since we disappeared?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
What are you talking about?

 
**Dr. Roman:**
I was monitoring you the whole time, and it's been less than an hour since the Rayshift!

 
**Mash:**
Wh-What!?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**Scáthach:**
Heheh. Looks like summer at Chaldea isn't over yet.

 
**Scáthach:**
Let's enjoy it a little bit longer then!

 
## Brilliant Summer - The Gáe Bolg Craftsman is an Early Riser -
 
**Scáthach:**
...Hmm.

 
**Mash:**
Is this the ash tree you planted?
Is something the matter?

 
**Scáthach:**
Well, just wait a bit.
Let's try to make a new spear with it.

 
**Mash:**
A spear...?

 
**Scáthach:**
Gáe Bolg was made from the bones of a sea monster.
It would be difficult to replicate that on this island.

 
**Scáthach:**
But I can make something that's extremely similar using the power of my runes.

 
**Mash:**
With this ash tree?

 
**Scáthach:**
Ash trees are descendants of the Norse world tree, Yggdrasil. And Yggdrasil is where the runes themselves come from.

 
**Scáthach:**
So if I borrow as much power as possible from this ash tree, then use my runes...

 
**Mash:**
You'll have more Gáe Bolgs?

 
**Scáthach:**
Exactly!
One spear per ash tree!

 
**Scáthach:**
Even from a non-crafter like myself, they should still be formidable. Enough to withstand the strain as a Noble Phantasm.

 
**Mash:**
Does that mean...?

 
**Scáthach:**
That's right. An increase in Noble Phantasm strength.

 
**Scáthach:**
...Anyway, I'll be pouring my heart and soul into this work, and in the meantime, I'd like you guys to stand guard.

 
**Mash:**
Uh, stand guard?

 
**Scáthach:**
I'll be crafting this spear all day and all night. The latter is most likely when those demon boars will show up.

 
**Scáthach:**
I'm counting on you guys!

 
**Mash:**
...She just left us here!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
I guess we don't have a choice.
Let's spend the day here, Master.

 
**Mash:**
I hope no demon boars come to attack us.

 
**Demon Boar:**
...

 
**Mash:**
Here's one now! As expected!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay, let's fight!

 
**Shadow Servant:**
...

 
**Mash:**
A Shadow Servant has shown up, too!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It'll be fine, probably!

 
**Giant Demon Boar:**
Grrrr...grrrarrrrr... (snort, snort)

 
**Mash:**
And a giant demon boar, too!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Give me a break!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Scáthach:**
Yes! It turned out great!

 
**Mash:**
I-I'm glad to hear it...

 
**Scáthach:**
Hey, Mash. Why do you look so tired?

 
**Mash:**
While we were standing guard, we were attacked by endless waves of enemies...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm beat.
 
**Scáthach:**
You look like you can barely stay awake,
Fujimaru. Your head's swaying back and forth like a floppy puppet.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I'm exhausted.
 
**Mash:**
Senpai, Senpai. We're done.
Let's go home.

 

 
**Mash:**
Hold my hand. Can you walk?
Should I carry you?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Scáthach:**
It must've been hard to fight all day and night.
Cut them some slack, Fou.

 
**Fou:**
Foou...

 
**Scáthach:**
Once we take a break at our base,
it's off to the next ash tree!

 
**Mash:**
What? There are more?

 
**Scáthach:**
Correct. Three more.
And once again, a full day and night for each one.

 
**Scáthach:**
I'm counting on you!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Zzz...

 
**Mash:**
Master, wake up!
Master! Master!

 
## Brilliant Summer - King Archer -
 
**Altria:**
Master, the boar piglets have found a cave nearby.

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Discovery! Digging! It's my island♪
Yup.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Everyone's from the generation that loves Dr. Jones.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
In 3D, caves are dark and cramped,
and kind of make me sick, yup.

 
**Altria:**
As always, these kids seem to be off in their own little world...

 
**Mash:**
A cave, huh?
Master, what should we do?

 
**Mash:**
The boar piglets seem to want to go explore...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To the dungeon!
 
**Mash:**
That was a quick reply.
Let's get going!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's an adventure!
 
**Altria:**
You are at the age when adventuring is exciting, Master.

 
**Altria:**
Before I became king, my brother Kay, Merlin, and I used to go on many adventures.

 
**Altria:**
You could say I am your adventuring senpai.
Please leave it to me.

 

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
It's a cave, yup.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
It's dark, yup.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
By the way, are we boar piglets nocturnal?
Or diurnal?

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
We'll always be Generation Z.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Teenage Mutant Boar Piglets, yup.

 
**Mash:**
Boar piglets, please calm down.
Just this once...please...

 
**Altria:**
Oh? Master, do you suppose this cave is...

 
**Altria:**
The one we visited 2,000 years ago?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Now that you mention it...
 
**Altria:**
Yes, this is the cave we visited with the pirate duo, Mash, and Marie back then.

 
**Altria:**
I believe it was...

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Was there a cave?
 
**Mash:**
Master, did you forget?

 
**Mash:**
Fou, Altria, Marie, Anne, Mary, and I were with you.
It's that cave...

 

 
**Mash:**
...It's quiet. And it's getting chilly.

 
**Fou:**
Fou... Fo-chooo!

 
**Marie:**
We blindly followed the boar piglets to a cave like this, but...

 
**Marie:**
Is there really a bad boar in here?

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Oink!

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Oink, oink!

 
**Mary:**
You're the one who's closest to them.
Don't ask us.

 
**Altria:**
I agree. We're letting you do all the communicating.

 
**Marie:**
Oh, yes. It's not that I doubt them, but...

 
**Marie:**
It's the first time I've had two boar piglets follow me,
so I thought it was strange.

 
**Anne:**
Don't worry. No matter what shows up, we're here.
Me, Mary, Master...

 
**Anne:**
Together, it feels like we've been pirates on the high seas for decades! Hehe!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So soft... a double headlock!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I-I can't breathe...

 
**Mary:**
Anne, that hurts... I don't mind it though...

 
**Anne:**
Oh, I'm sorry. Caves just get me so excited.

 
**Altria:**
I don't know what good pirating is, but I'm here too. Don't be scared, Marie.

 
**Anne:**
Humph. It feels like you're making fun of us pirates.
Like she should be looking to a king for help instead.

 
**Altria:**
I didn't mean it that way. Although, if we are being honest, does it not make more sense to count on a king rather than a pirate?

 
**Mary:**
Humph.

 
**Mash:**
A-Anyway, we're pretty deep in!
Are we there yet?

 
**Marie:**
I don't know...
Oh, the boar piglets jumped out of my arms.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Oink!

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Oink-oink!

 
**Mash:**
The cave splits into two paths. And each boar piglet is standing in front of a different branch.

 
**Altria:**
Which is the right way?

 
**Marie:**
Hmm. I don't know.

 
**Marie:**
Both of them seem to be saying, “Follow me!”

 
**Marie:**
Let's peek a little ahead...

 
**Altria & Anne:**
Marie, watch out!

 
**Marie:**
Oh my. An icicle fell from the ceiling...
Thank you both. It almost impaled me.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A natural trap...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Nice shot.

 
**Mash:**
It fell so suddenly I couldn't block it with my shield. Great job, Archers.

 
**Altria & Anne:**
No, it was nothing...

 
**Altria:**
Humph.

 
**Anne:**
Humph.

 
**Altria:**
I think my water blast was faster.

 
**Anne:**
Surely my bullet was?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(Both of them are surprisingly competitive...)

 
**Mash:**
Both paths look identical.
The ceilings are covered in icicles.

 
**Mash:**
Whichever we choose, we'll still be in danger like before. What should we do?

 
**Anne:**
I guess we've got no choice.
Shall we split up?

 
**Anne:**
With an Archer's eyes, it'll be easy to shoot down the icicles as they fall.

 
**Altria:**
Oh. So you want to split up here?

 
**Altria:**
And we'll see which of us gets to the goal first?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Th-This is getting weird!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
L-Let's get along, guys!

 
**Altria:**
Don't worry. This is just a little test of skill.
A practice fight, not a real one.

 
**Anne:**
That's right, Master. Just a little game.

 
**Anne:**
We're not deciding which of us is the better Archer or anything.

 
**Mary:**
How shall we split up?
I can't leave Anne, and Mash isn't going to leave Master.

 
**Mary:**
Based on our numbers, the King of Knights can go with them, and Marie can come with us. Fou, you stay with them.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Anne:**
Let's go! We'll take the initiative!
Marie, this way!

 
**Marie:**
Heeeeeelp meee!

 
**Marie:**
Hehe. Kiyohime and Tamamo taught me what a kidnapped princess sounds like.

 
**Marie:**
I always wanted to say that!

 
**Mash:**
Oh, they're gone...

 
**Altria:**
Let's get going too!
My pride as a knight is at stake, I cannot lose!

 
**Altria:**
Another icicle! Fire!

 
**Mash:**
I blocked the fragments with my shield.
Are you okay, Master?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm fine.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
No problemo.

 
**Altria:**
I won't miss any.
Don't worry. Humph!

 
**Anne:**
There! There! And there!

 
**Mary:**
They're falling in a row!
And they're heading straight for you!

 
**Anne:**
I predicted that! I'm ready!

 
**Mash:**
Sound echoes in the cave. You can tell how good their teamwork is just by listening.

 
**Altria:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is something wrong?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
You're good too, Altria!

 
**Altria:**
I can say this because they're not here, but their teamwork is impressive.

 
**Altria:**
Even I admit it.
Those two are like one being.

 
**Altria:**
They trust each other with their lives&ndash; and that creates a greater power than they each have on their own.

 
**Altria:**
That's what it means to have a true partner, I suppose.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You had comrades too, Altria.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What about the Knights of the Round Table?

 
**Altria:**
The Round Table... They were trusted comrades, but they were knights, and I was their king.

 
**Altria:**
They were different than partners.

 
**Mash:**
...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Did you want a partner?

 
**Altria:**
No. I'm simply observing at something I don't have.
A king does not desire a partner.

 
**Altria:**
...Perhaps I had something similar, at one time, in a world different from this one.

 
**Altria:**
Someone with whom I fought side-by-side.
Someone I would have called a partner.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
There's someone here who could be your partner.

 
**Altria:**
...!

 
**Altria:**
...

 
**Altria:**
Yes, you're right. I'm a king, but I'm also just a Servant.

 
**Altria:**
Master, if I could become a partner you can build a trusting relationship with... That would be truly wonderful.

 
**Mash:**
I-I'm here too! I think you can have that kind of relationship with three people!

 
**Mash:**
I mean, I may be a Demi-Servant, so strictly speaking, um...

 
**Altria:**
That's right. You're here too, Mash.

 
**Altria:**
Now, let's work together, like partners, so that we don't let the other side beat us!

 
**Mash:**
We're in an open area! This is...

 
**Anne:**
Oh my...

 
**Marie:**
Oh, I guess it connected to the same place.

 
**Mary:**
Who got here first?

 
**Anne:**
It was us, right?

 
**Altria:**
Wait. The tip of my gun entered this space first.
The victor is clear as day.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(She really is competitive...)

 
**Anne:**
The deciding factor has to be whose body entered first. And since I jumped forward, that means my&ndash;

 
**Altria:**
Tch!

 
**Mash:**
F-Forget that!
Look over there!

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Piggy!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A poisonous swamp at the back of the cave!

 
**Mash:**
Yes, and&ndash;

 
**Mary:**
There's two of them!

 
**Marie:**
Oh... The boar piglets probably remembered both of their scents. That's how we got here.

 
**Anne:**
They're coming... We'll have to fight both of them together, but we should be able to handle them!

 
**Mary:**
No problem. We can do it.

 
**Altria:**
Of course, I'll fight too!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Time for some teamwork!

 
**Anne:**
...!

 
**Mary:**
...!

 
**Altria:**
...!

 
**Marie:**
Hehe. You're right.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. Let's show them the power of partnership!

 
**Altria:**
I guess you remembered.

 
**Mash:**
That's right.
The demon boars ran off during the battle.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Altria:**
Right. We couldn't bring things to an end, but they stopped using this cave as a home, and peace was restored.

 
**Mash:**
Does that mean there's nothing left in this cave?

 
**Altria:**
No, not at all... In fact, it looks like our 2,000-year-old battle is about to resume!

 
**Mash:**
Demon boars...?

 
**G：Anne?:**
...

 
**H：Mary?:**
...

 
**Mash:**
You two...?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
Fou, I know.
Those two are not them.

 
**Altria:**
Anne Bonny.
Mary Read.

 
**Altria:**
...They took their forms, then?

 
**Altria:**
They kept the memory of their defeat, and now they've managed to recreate it.

 
**Altria:**
But...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
They didn't copy you, Altria.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 
**Mash:**
Master... Don't say that!

 
**Altria:**
That's right. Absolutely right.
Why not me?

 
**Altria:**
Those two pirates count as one Servant.
Were they chosen because of their number?

 
**Mash:**
Altria may not look it, but she's actually one of the most powerful Servants of all...

 
**Altria:**
Demon boars, you're about to learn that you made a fatal mistake!

 
**Mash:**
She really is competitive!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Altria:**
Okay, Master!
This time we killed them for sure!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're the best, Altria!

 
**Altria:**
Of course I am.

 
**Altria:**
I may be limited with the sacred sword, I may not be a Saber... But even so, there's no doubt I'm still the best Servant around.

 
**Altria:**
I'm glad that you understand that, Master. Yes.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
At any rate, we were able to liberate this cave, too.

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Maybe there'll be a mineral vein or something, yup.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
It feels like we'll find jewels or something, yup.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Jewel, oh jewel, who's the happiest of them all?

 
**Mash:**
As usual, the boar piglets don't engage their brains before they speak...

 
## Brilliant Summer - Legend of the 21st Century Savior -
 
**Mash:**
We're almost there, Martha.

 
**Martha:**
I see.
So these are the ruins Beowulf holds dominion over.

 
**Mash:**
Yes! Your fist is the only thing that is going to shatter his oppression!

 
**Martha:**
Huh? Why's it gotta be me?
...Er, ahem, I mean...

 
**Martha:**
...Why was I chosen?

 
**Mash:**
Uh, because, well...

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You passionately rave about your iron fists...
 
**Martha:**
Hahahaha, that's a funny joke, Master.

 
**Martha:**
Now I have a quiz for you.
Do I look like I'm laughing?

 
**Mash:**
Senpai, please do not hide behind me.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Because you're like a messiah, a Fist of Chaldea...
 
**Mash:**
I see.

 
**Mash:**
If we're talking about a messiah, it's true Martha would be the best Servant for the job.

 
**Martha:**
I am not worthy of such a title.

 
**Martha:**
...But now that you've used it, it's not something I can disregard. I shall do the best I can.

 

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Sorry for all this.

 
**Both:**
?

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Mash:**
The town is still in ruins.

 
**Martha:**
What a waste. If the land were properly cultivated, the boar piglets would be able to live here.

 
**Kojirou:**
Well, sorry about that. Destroying things and committing atrocities&mdash;that's all they're good at here.

 
**Martha:**
...It's the shabby samurai!

 
**Mash:**
Kojirou!?

 
**Kojirou:**
Hi, Martha. Long time no see.

 
**Martha:**
Where the heck were you?

 
**Kojirou:**
I got thrown into the rough waves, and the next thing I knew, Sir Beowulf was saving me from being eaten alive by a demon boar.

 
**Kojirou:**
How intriguing fate can be.

 
**Martha:**
Okay... So you're working as a gatekeeper again?

 
**Kojirou:**
Yes, albeit reluctantly. Still, it is a man's obligation to repay another for hospitality received. I suppose fate just has me associated with gates.

 
**Kojirou:**
Right, Karna?

 
**Mash:**
Oh, you're here too, Karna!
I'm glad to see you're safe!

 
**Karna:**
Yes. However, as you just heard...

 
**Karna:**
We have been ordered to block your path.

 
**Karna:**
That said, I do not think Beowulf is seriously trying to hinder you. More like he wants to test your abilities.

 
**Martha:**
Hmm, okay.
So he's sizing me up.

 
**Martha:**
Fine with me... Bring it on!

 
**Karna:**
...He's trying to test your fists, so to speak.

 
**Martha:**
Was that clarification really necessary!?

 
**Karna:**
At any rate, ready your fists.
I shall see if you are fit to be...

 
**Karna:**
...a messiah.

 
**Martha:**
(Sigh)

 
**Martha:**
Well, I guess you guys have your social obligations.

 
**Martha:**
And as warriors, there's no way you would hold back.

 
**Martha:**
Sheesh, what a complicated way of life...

 
**Kojirou:**
Hm. Such inconveniences are natural to the way of life we swear by.

 
**Kojirou:**
Our actions are not dictated by what can be gained and what can be lost. They aren't even about honor and prestige.

 
**Kojirou:**
We are idiots who decided we could not live any other way.

 
**Kojirou:**
So, how about a nice, clean bout, Martha?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Martha:**
Taaaaaaake thaaaaat!

 
**Mash:**
You're incapacitated!
May I declare this our victory?

 
**Kojirou:**
Well, well, how impressive.
You really are a messiah.

 
**Kojirou:**
You are like the ideal monarch of the world, Chakravartin, knocking down any hardships with your fists.

 
**Martha:**
...But I am not a Buddhist.

 
**Karna:**
At any rate, you've cleared your path.
It's time for you to meet our king.

 
**Mash:**
Master, Martha. We're finally going to confront Beowulf.

 
**Mash:**
We should stay sharp, be ready at any moment, and always&ndash;

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Let's give him a good beating, Boss!
 
**Martha:**
I told you! Don't talk to me like a thug!

 
**Martha:**
It makes me sound shady!
Needlessly!

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
We're counting on you, Saint Martha.
 
**Martha:**
Huh? O-Oh.

 
**Martha:**
Ahem. I am not someone who deserves to be honored as a saint, but...

 
**Martha:**
We should punish&ndash;I mean, admonish him. Yes, that's it! A sermon! A gracious sermon would be nice!

 
**Fou:**
...

 
**Kojirou:**
Fou, you seem to want to say,
“She means with her fists.”

 
**Fou:**
Fou!?

 

 
**Mash:**
...There he is!

 
**Beowulf:**
Welcome!
I'm glad you bastards came!

 
**Beowulf:**
Nice. I can feel the hot wind blowing towards me. That aura of yours... You're not some half-baked grappler!

 
**Martha:**
No, I'm just a woman who believes in her Lord.

 
**Martha:**
I am neither a grappler, nor a boxer, nor a wrestler.
...Absolutely not.

 
**Beowulf:**
Give me a break! With a fighting spirit like yours, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman!

 
**Beowulf:**
You've got to be a famed fighter.

 
**Martha:**
My name is Martha, just Martha.
...Though some people call me a saint.

 
**Beowulf:**
I see... Just a Saint burning her Cosmo, huh?

 
**Martha:**
That's right, precisely! I'm a saint, a holy woman.
Now, Beowulf...

 
**Martha:**
Go back to your duty as a Servant who protects and guides the weak.

 
**Martha:**
You know, I can give off some glittering light or play a hymn if you want.

 
**Beowulf:**
I bet you use some ultimate technique.
You're a Saint after all.

 
**Beowulf:**
What? Did you just say something?

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
Fou, shhh.

 
**Beowulf:**
...Anyway! Hey, demon boars!
Show her your hospitality!

 
**Martha:**
Ah, how terrible.
Poor, innocent, animals...

 
**Mash:**
It was a direct hit!
Martha, are you all right!?

 
**Martha:**
...

 
**Martha:**
...Hmph. All right then, fine!
If it's a fistfight you want, then that's what you'll get!

 
**Martha:**
Bring it on! ...Uh, I mean, have at you!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Beowulf:**
Hahahaha! I'm impressed! No wonder the boar piglets worship you as the Goddess of the Iron Fist!

 
**Martha:**
What!? Where did such a shameful title come from!?

 
**Beowulf:**
From a boar piglet that I've taken hostage!

 
**Martha:**
What? A hostage!? I can't believe you'd stoop so low! Grrrr...

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Ah.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Please help, yup!

 
**Mash:**
...Any tense situation just gets dissolved with the boar piglets around...

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Beowulf:**
Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

 
**Beowulf:**
I'm protecting him because he got lost.
I haven't laid a single finger on him!

 
**Beowulf:**
You fools should know that I can be a gentleman when I want to!

 
**Beowulf:**
Eh? You had no idea?
Fine.

 
**Beowulf:**
Whatever.
Anyway, it's my turn!

 
**Beowulf:**
Sorry, but I can't afford to be soft on you.
I'm going full throttle from the start!

 
**Beowulf:**
Demon boars!
Sing me a song of triumph!

 
**Martha:**
Bring it on!

 
**Martha:**
If you come at me full throttle, I won't hold back either!

 
**Martha:**
I will kick your ass!
Whoachaaaa!!

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Another fighting reference!?

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Martha:**
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!

 
**Beowulf:**
Oooooooooohhhhh!!

 
**Mash:**
A cross counter!
The one down is...Beowulf!

 
**Beowulf:**
Ugh! That was a good one...Goddess Iron Fist...

 
**Martha:**
Can you stop calling me that!?

 
**Beowulf:**
I guess that settles it... You're stronger than me...

 
**Beowulf:**
At least I fought someone tough like you in the end.
I have no regrets in my life...!

 
**Martha:**
Huh, what are talking about?
You lost, but I won't let you just die.

 
**Martha:**
You've got to work hard and rebuild this town.
Restore it.

 
**Martha:**
Do it like your life depends on it.
If you refuse, I will kick your ass until you say yes!

 
**Beowulf:**
...You got me.
Seems like I'm the one who got completely thrashed.

 
**Kojirou:**
Well now, everything seems to have worked out fine. You're the best, Ms. Martha.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Goddess! (Thump thump)

 
**Martha:**
Thank goodness. Are you all right?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
I am impressed, yup.
I wish to follow your example, yup!

 
**Martha:**
You do, huh? But this is a dangerous business.
Don't go copying me now!

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Well, we'd like to build a gigantic fist sculpture to commemorate your legacy, yup. Right here, in fact...

 
**Martha:**
No. Absolutely not.

 
**Boar Piglet:**
...Oh, how extremely unfortunate...

 
**Mash:**
At any rate, the town is now free.
Let's continue working on its development!

 
**Martha:**
...There'll absolutely and positively be NO fist sculpture, all right? Are we clear?

 
**Boar Piglet:**
Got it, yup.

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Mash:**
(I feel like they're going to do it anyway, but I'll just keep quiet... We won't get anywhere otherwise...)

 
## Brilliant Summer - Sing a Song! -
 
**Marie:**
And a one, and a two♪

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Doo-waaa♪

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Bala-bon-bala-bon♪

 
**Marie:**
Yes, very good.
Keep going!

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Elohim, Essaim♪

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn♪

 
**Marie:**
Huh? That doesn't sound right.

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Mash:**
Their voices are so lovely.
It's all very soothing.

 
**Mary:**
Really? I was hoping for a more extreme song.

 
**Mary:**
Something more pirate-like... A rebellious rock anthem, for example.

 
**Anne:**
...That incantation at the end wasn't extreme enough for you?

 
**Marie:**
Yes, you're all good.

 
**Marie:**
A beautiful voice heals the soul, so don't ever forget how to sing, little ones, okay?

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Okay!

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Singing is such a wonderful activity, yup.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
The finest achievement of a civilization, yup.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Will singing lead to world peace? Will it make weapons disappear? Will it turn the world into a giant unisex hot spring?

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Nope.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Oh...

 
**Marie:**
???

 
**Mash:**
I don't think even she can understand the piglets' logic anymore. Not even France's number one idol.

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Idol. I like the sound of that, yup.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Why don't we have a concert?
I want to really test my pipes, yup.

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Let's do it, yup.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Let's do it, yup.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Then it's decided, yup.

 
**Marie:**
Huh? What's decided?

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Goddess.
We want to hold a concert, yup!

 
**Marie:**
...Wonderful! That's a wonderful idea!
Oh, little ones, you're amazing!

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Aw shucks, yup.

 
**Marie:**
Hmm, but we'll need a proper venue.

 
**Marie:**
...Come to think of it, the other day we just built a... Aha!

 
**Marie:**
Master!
I just had a good idea!

 
**Mash:**
A boar piglet concert?
Yes, I think that's a lovely idea.

 
**Marie:**
I know, right?
Let's start by making invitations!

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Invitations?

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Like the ones from the devil, yup?

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
It's a sad thing that your adventures...

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
...have only just begun here.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Oh? I don't think that's how the message goes.

 
**Mash:**
...All right, piglets. Let's get to work.

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Okay!

 
**Fou:**
Fou...

 
**Marie:**
We made a lot of invitations.
Let's hand them out to the other piglets.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
We can live off of the royalties, yup.

 
**Marie:**
That's for another time.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Goddess, Goddess.
Who should we deliver the invitations to?

 
**Marie:**
Who? Mmm, how about to those you want to become friends with?

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
That we want to be friends with, yup?

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
I want to deliver love and excitement all over the world, yup!

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Because love and excitement are free!

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Free... I like the sound of that.

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 
**Marie:**
Fujimaru, Mash, please deliver the invitations to everyone, too.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, sure.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Roger!

 
**Mash:**
Well, Senpai, what should we do? Shall we start by delivering them to the other boar piglets?

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
We'd appreciate that, yup.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
(Praying)

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Invitations delivered by Master will surely be valued at a premium, yup.

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
Auction, auction, yup!

 
**Mash:**
They won't attract a premium, no.
Please use them.

 
**Mash:**
We passed them out to a lot of boar piglets, but there are still so many left.

 
**Mash:**
...Look at how most of them are just showing them off to each other...

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
My invitation has been specially printed, yup.
Want to see?

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
Mine is fancier. The color is bone white and the typeface is... S-Silian Rail?

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Now there's some fast trivia for you, yup.

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
This conversation makes me think of the last days of a materialistic civilization.

 
**Fou:**
Fou!

 
**Mash:**
I think Fou wants to call “Out!” on that last comment.

 
**Mash:**
Anyway, I think it would be meaningless to deliver any more invitations to the boar piglets.

 
**Marie:**
Mash, Master.
What's the matter?

 
**Mash:**
We've handed out most of the invitations now, but...

 
**Marie:**
Hmm...I know!
Let's give them to other Servants, too.

 
**Marie:**
I'm sure everyone would want to listen to the boar piglets sing.

 
**Mash:**
Y-You think so?

 
**Marie:**
Come on, let's force the invitations on anyone we see!

 
**Altria:**
...Singing piglets?
I see. That certainly sounds like a nice experiment.

 
**Altria:**
The building is almost complete, so I'll probably be a little late, but count me in.

 
**Mordred:**
Huh? A boar piglet concert?
I-I'm not interested. Besides, I'm a delinquent!

 
**Mordred:**
And I'm busy surfing, too!

 
**Marie:**
No excuses.
Like it or not, you're going to listen to them, Miss Mo.

 
**Marie:**
After all, they're looking forward to it.
So if you still refuse, knowing that, then&ndash;

 
**Mordred:**
Then what?

 
**Mordred:**
Well, Your Highness!? If you want to threaten me, you'd better put a little muscle on those scrawny arms first!

 
**Marie:**
If that's the way you want it to be, I'll maul you with this beach ball and force the invitation on you!

 
**Mordred:**
Seriously!? I see!!

 
**Mordred:**
You asked for it! This'll be a nice change of pace for me, taking on a Servant instead of the usual demon boars!

 
**Mordred:**
All right, come and get me!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Mordred:**
Argh! I lost! Fine, you win.
I'll go, dammit!

 
**Marie:**
Heeheehee.
Thank you, Miss Mo!

 
**Mordred:**
Stop calling me that already.

 
**Mash:**
...Master, it seems like Mordred held back a little.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I bet she actually wanted to go.
 
**Mash:**
Exactly. No matter what she says, Mordred is actually fond of the boar piglets.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Just being shy.
 
**Mordred:**
Hey, Master.
Keep yapping like that and I'll sew your mouth shut!

 

 
**Marie:**
Okay, who else should we give an invitation to? If possible, I'd like it to be another Servant who refuses to come!

 
**Mash:**
...Are you pondering what I'm pondering?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Excuse me? The boar piglets in concert? Mmm, that's not Tamamo's style. I'm not really interested, so I'll pass!

 
**Marie:**
You can't.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Huh? But I said no.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Watching those boar piglets singing on stage is not my idea of a good time.

 
**Marie:**
Too bad♪

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Um, from the way you're holding that beach ball,
I take it&ndash;

 
**Marie:**
Yes! after I knock you out, I will stuff the invitation in your hands!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
MIKOOON!

 
**--BATTLE--**
 
**Marie:**
I won! So I'll just stuff this invitation somewhere on you!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Don't they have laws against threats on this island?

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Treats?

 
**C：Boar Piglet:**
There's medicine for stomachaches from eating too many treats, yup.

 
**D：Boar Piglet:**
It won't make you drowsy or tired either. Plus it works as a painkiller. Oh, and it cures cavities and appendicitis, yup.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
And it's completely LEGAL, yup!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
As always, you speak of teeth-grinding nonsense that has nothing to do with us!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I'm sure your concert will be just as bad, if not worse!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Ugh, but I'm forced to go after losing that duel, so I had better be prepared...

 
**Marie:**
All right, the concert hall is filled to capacity!

 
**Mash:**
This must be exciting, Marie.

 
**Altria:**
All of the singing boar piglets are here.
It's adorable how nervous they seem.

 
**Mordred:**
I wonder what they're going to sing.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Hmph. Songs not fit for human or Servant ears,
I'll wager.

 
**E：Boar Piglet:**
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to start things off with this little number, yup. The title is...

 
**Mash:**
Those were some truly fantastic songs.

 
**Mash:**
A standing ovation... Thunderous applause... The boar piglets seem extremely pleased with the outcome, too.

 
**Mash:**
...Just one thing, though.

 
**Mash:**
For some reason all of the songs they chose had troubling lyrics and a dark tone.

 
**Mash:**
Like “One, two, Freddy's coming for you”... “Don't you ever laugh as the hearse goes by”... and “Bloody Mary”...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I told you so!!

 
## Project 1: Let's Repair the Building
 
**Mash:**
Let's start by repairing the buildings.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yes, that's right. Obviously, we should start from our place of residence.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
We have ways of getting food and clothing, so let's work on shelter.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
The skyscrapers return, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Or we could do it Japanese style, yup!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Flashy neon signs. Kabukicho: the place where men's desires gather! Red light districts, yup!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
We've got these three choices.
Which will you pick, Master?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I prefer...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
While cheap neon signs are fine, I think we should go over-the-top Japanese here! Let's go Japanese-style!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Any one of them would be fine, yup!
Your choice, Master!


## Project 1 Plan A: Let's Build a Skyscraper
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
This is our first construction, so we have to start from the basics... By the way, how is it you boar piglets can do all of this?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Right! That's a trade secret, yup!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Although batteries were not included, yup!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
They're not showing the slightest intent to answer!

 
## Project 1 Plan B: Let's Build a Japanese-style Building
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Yes! Japanese-style was truly the best choice, Master!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
The texture and scent of tatami mats!
I can't wait to roll on it!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
I want to roll on it, yup.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
I want to slack off, yup.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Another day of fun labor, everyone! Let's get to it!

 
## Project 1 Plan C: Let's Build a Neon Sign Building
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Th-This is...a bit lewd?
Maybe “degenerate” is a better word...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
No, I don't mind it, but...

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
This is Kabukicho in Shinjuku!
The place where the desires of men and women...!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
In other words, the goddess of Kabukicho!
Degenerate art!

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Well, it's nice that you're cheerful.
Now, let's get to work!

 
## Project 2: Let's Build a Power Plant
 
**Marie:**
It looks like the boar piglets need some kind of energy source.

 
**Mash:**
Yes. So next we need to build a power plant.

 
**Mash:**
When you think about it, isn't the idea of building a power plant amazing, Master?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Nothing is impossible for science, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Isn't this magecraft more than science?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Isn't this like great magecraft on the level of a Reality Marble?

 
**Marie:**
So what form will the power plant take?
I'm very interested!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Fire!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Water!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Wind, yup!

 
**Mash:**
Thermal power, hydroelectric power, wind turbines...
All common choices.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Which will it be, Master!


## Project 2 Plan A: Let's Build a Thermal Power Plant
 
**Marie:**
A thermal power plant... It's huge!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Generators have an aura of masculinity, yup.

 
**Mash:**
By the way, what are you burning to power it?

 
**Mash:**
It's not oil or coal...right?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
It's Altrium.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
It's the energy of dreams.
That whatsits-drive has nothing on it!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
You can dig anywhere around this island and the Altrium will just glom onto your shovel, yup.

 
**Mash:**
Oh, I see...

 
**Mash:**
Glom onto it?

 
## Project 2 Plan B: Let's Build a Hydroelectric Plant
 
**Marie:**
Oh my, this power plant is so big!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Go big or go home!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Waterwheels have an aura of masculinity, yup.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
The waterwheel is maternal instinct...a slowly turning maternal instinct, yup.

 
**Mash:**
It feels like they're building something crazy.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's too late now...

 
**Mash:**
Yes...

 
## Project 2 Plan C: Let's Build a Wind Power Plant
 
**Marie:**
Oh my, how cute!
You can make electricity with windmills?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Goddess, all power plants work by spinning something.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Wind power is ecological, yup!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Let the wind blow, yup!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Summon a storm, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Don't summon one.

 
**Mash:**
I can't wait until it starts to spin, Master!

 
## Project 3: Let's Build a Shop
 
**Mary:**
I want to make a store.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
To rob it?
 
**Mary:**
Wrong, silly.
Though I might end up doing it anyway.

 
**Mary:**
No, I'm going to buy stuff. Yes, and pay.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Because you're a pirate?
 
**Anne:**
COMPLETELY off.
A currency-based economy is important.

 
**Anne:**
A functional market is a boon for pirates.

 
**Anne:**
It's a win-win relationship, you could say.

 
**Mash:**
I feel like this is off the mark...

 

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
These are what we can make right now, Master!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
A convenience store!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
A dollar store!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
A used book store!
These three, yup!

 
**Mary:**
For some reason none of those options get me excited.

 
**Anne:**
It doesn't seem like there will be high-priced products.


## Project 3 Plan A: Let's Build a Convenience Store
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Howdy, y'all!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Y'all come back now, y'hear?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
We're practicing our customer service, yup!

 
**Mary:**
Are the accents really necessary?

 
## Project 3 Plan B: Let's Build a Dollar Store
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Come one, come all!
We've got great deals, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Everything is a dollar!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
A dollar? Interesting setup, when you consider that we haven't established a currency-based economy.

 
**Anne:**
Oh, something so convenient is this inexpensive!?
But I don't know where I could use it.

 
## Project 3 Plan C: Let's Build a Used Book Store
 
**Mary:**
Uh, I'm not really interested.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Oh, don't be like that.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
We have doujin here, too.
Like the book Blackbeard worked very hard to make.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
It's a new book about Anne and Mary!
It's a must read!

 
**Anne:**
Let's burn it. Right now.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Awwww.

 
## Project 4: Let's Build a Restaurant
 
**Altria:**
I see. So you're going to make a place where food is served.

 
**Altria:**
Then my advice shall come in handy.

 
**Mash:**
R-Right.
Go ahead, boar piglets.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
A hamburger shop!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
A beef bowl shop!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
A kebab shop!

 
**Altria:**
That is quite a lot of junk food.
I would prefer... No, never mind.

 
**Altria:**
By the way, where is the meat going to come from?

 
**Boar Piglets:**
That's a secret.

 
**Fou:**
Foou.


## Project 4 Plan A: Let's Build a Burger Shop
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Do you like smiles?!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
In fact, that's all we have for sale!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Since the shop hasn't opened yet, yup!

 
**Altria:**
Hamburgers... Well, well...

 
## Project 4 Plan B: Let's Build a Beef Bowl Shop
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Hey, Mister.
About this beef bowl shop...

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Are you really using beef?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Don't worry, yup.
See, my hoof isn't even shaking.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Very suspicious.

 
**Mash:**
Please stop saying things that will make me lose my appetite...

 
**Altria:**
Hmm? (Munch munch)

 
## Project 4 Plan C: Let's Build a Kebab Shop
 
**Mash:**
Doner kebab.
That's a Turkish dish, isn't it?

 
**Mash:**
Apparently you put sliced lamb meat into pita bread and then add sauce.

 
**Mash:**
Lamb meat?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
One lamb, two lambs...

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
One boar piglet, two boar piglets...

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Three boar piglets jumping on the bed...one fell off and bumped his head...

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
And now he's dead, yup...

 
**Mash:**
Please don't die.

 
## Project 5: Let's Build a Sweets Shop
 
**Marie:**
Oh my, we can have some snacks!
How wonderful!

 
**Marie:**
But it might be nice to have Japanese-style confections instead of the sweets I am used to.

 
**Marie:**
Oh, I am torn!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Sweets.
They are the forbidden fruit.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Sweets.
They're not filling, and they're high in calories.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Sweets. When you find out how much sugar is in them, you kind of freak out.

 
**Mash:**
Do you really think it's a good idea to let them build a sweets shop, Senpai?


## Project 5 Plan A: Let's Build a Cake Shop
 
**Marie:**
I'm not telling♪

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
It's a preemptive crushing blow, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Goddess sees right through us, yup!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
We want to know where the best supply comes from.

 
**Marie:**
Have some delicious cake and forget all about it. Okay?

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Okay!

 
## Project 5 Plan B: Let's Build a Dumpling Shop
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Dumplings!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Dumplings!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Dump-ster!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
The dumpster contained a dead body...in this dark, suspenseful movie.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Coming soon to a theater near you!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
You heard it, yup.

 
**Marie:**
Oh Mash. I have no idea what the boar piglets are going on about. What shall I do?

 
**Mash:**
It's all right.
I don't think anyone understands them.

 
## Project 5 Plan C: Let's Build a Candy Shop
 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Hey lady, I'll take this.

 
**Marie:**
That'll be 500,000 QP!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
That's expensive!

 
**Marie:**
Then you can have it for 50 QP!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Okay!

 
**Marie:**
Here's your change! 500,000 QP!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Yay!

 
**Mash:**
What are Marie and the boar piglets doing?

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Playing make-believe?
 
**Marie:**
Does it suit me?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It looks like you really wanted to do it.
 
**Marie:**
Heehee, this is fun. If I hadn't married, perhaps I would have run a shop like this?

 

 
**Mash:**
Well, as long as they're having fun.

 
## Project 6: Let's Build a Bridge
 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh, Master! Master! And Mash, too.
Look at this.

 
**Mash:**
Yes, what is it?
Oh, are you making a bridge?

 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes, if we connect these two spots with a bridge, we will have a shorter distance between the bases.

 
**Kiyohime:**
We made one 2,000 years ago, but it's gone now.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down♪

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Even the roof fell.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Shattered...disappeared...

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Like a...suspense movie?

 
**Kiyohime:**
...

 
**Kiyohime:**
Take this seriously, okay?

 
**Boar Piglets:**
Yes ma'am!

 
**Mash:**
I see. Kiyohime has no interest whatsoever in the boar piglets, so she's their natural enemy.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Yes. And my weak point is Master.
This is truly a three-way standoff.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're my weak point, too.
 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh dear! Weak point?
You're making me blush!

 
**Kiyohime:**
May I assume this is a marriage proposal!?

 
**Fou:**
Fou.

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I don't think I could defeat you.
 
**Kiyohime:**
Oh my. Heheh. You defeated me a long time ago, Master.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Love! Love! The dragon cries.
If you would take pity on me, then give me your love.

 
**Fou:**
Foufoufooou!

 

 
**Kiyohime:**
Well let's put this conversation aside for now, and bring it back up later.

 
**Kiyohime:**
Which bridge would you prefer, Master?


## Project 6 Plan A: Let's Build a Red Bridge
 
**Altria:**
Th-This is...!

 
**Cú Chulainn:**
Hey, I've seen this bridge before.

 
**Altria:**
It is a bit much to say that it brings back memories, but... Hah, what a curious coincidence.

 
## Project 6 Plan B: Let's Build Tower Bridge
 
**Mordred:**
You guys really did go for a Tower Bridge.
Tower Bridge, huh?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
And it'll have a function to transform into Great Britain Man!

 
**Mordred:**
Seriously!?
Awesome! You have to show it to me once it's done!!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
I was about to say that it was just a joke, but...

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
What do we do?

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
We'll have to make it, yup.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
The men rose as one.
(Heroic and moving background music)

 
**Mash:**
No, I'll explain to Mordred.
Please make it a normal bridge.

 
## Project 6 Plan C: Let's Build Rainbow Bridge
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
We appreciate your building it, but how to put this...

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
It looks like it would be blockaded! Or blown up!
Or cut off from support, fighting on its own!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Sir, yes, sir!
This will surely be picked up as a movie! Hooray!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Yay!

 
**Kiyohime:**
Rather than sacrificing a human for the bridge, shall I sacrifice a boar piglet?

 
**Boar Piglets:**
We're sorry!

 
## Project 7: Let's Build an Amusement Center
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
I'd like some entertainment, yup.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
You mean manga?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Not that.

 
**Mash:**
An entertainment establishment, perhaps?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
That's about the last thing we can make for them, right, Master?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
But there are various types of entertainment.
What do you have in mind?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
A theater?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Hmm. A movie theater.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
A museum?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Hmm. A museum.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Zoo.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I see. A zoo.
A zoo?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Like a garden where you can observe animals.

 
---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Probably best not to ask.
 
**Mash:**
Yes. It would be difficult to comment on that.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
They're not going to put me in there, are they?

 

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What's at the zoo?
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Us, of course.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
You go to the zoo to see boar piglets.
It's very high-context dark humor.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

 

 
**Mash:**
So Master, what should we make?


## Project 7 Plan A: Let's Build a Movie Theater
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
A movie?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
I would like them to showcase movies with romantic love stories.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Boarmax theaters only show movies that feature boar piglets, yup.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
And the weird thing is that the lineup is mostly crappy horror movies.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
I don't know why.

 
**Mash:**
I think you should remedy that situation.

 
## Project 7 Plan B: Let's Build a Museum
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
That's a weird objet d'art.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
I've heard that most museums have things like this.

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Well, I suppose that's true, but does it even have a concept...?

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
“The suffering that flows between original sin and penance like a deep ocean.”

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
You just made that up, didn't you?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Yes.

 
## Project 7 Plan C: Let's Build a Zoo
 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
They really made a zoo...

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Would you like to go in the cage?

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
Shall I send you flying?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
I guess not.

 
## Project 8: Let's Build Another Amusement Center
 
**Mordred:**
What? Another entertainment spot?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
It's good to have fun, yup!

 
**Mordred:**
Well, if that's what you guys want, I don't mind.

 
**Mordred:**
So? What's it gonna be?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Yes. Karaoke.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Oui. An arcade.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Wow. And a casino.

 
**Mordred:**
These guys seem like they'd get way too into that kind of entertainment. Hope it turns out alright...


## Project 8 Plan A: Let's Build a Karaoke Box
 
**Mordred:**
This karaoke room is freaking tiny!
I walk in and I'm already squished!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
That's because this karaoke is intended for boar piglets.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
It's also fun to sing karaoke alone, yup.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Speak not thy saddening words of loneliness and despair...

 
**Tamamo-no-Mae:**
You are so off subject that you've even started speaking differently.

 
## Project 8 Plan B: Let's Build an Arcade
 
**Mordred:**
An arcade? That's perfect for me.

 
**Fou:**
Fou, foufou, fou.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Getting dragged back home by mom is part of the experience, yup.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Attention. Will the nurse in red please come to the front? We found your child.

 
**Mordred:**
Mom, forgive me!

 
**Fou:**
F-fouuu.

 
## Project 8 Plan C: Let's Build a Casino
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
A casino is cool, yup.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Roulette.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Blackjack.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Baccarat.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Desires covet other desires. A dangerous seduction.
That is the Boar Piglet casino.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
By the way, we cannot convert chips into money.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
That sounds about right.

 
## Project 9: Let's Build Even More Amusement Centers
 
**Martha:**
Another entertainment facility?

 
**Martha:**
Don't you think you guys have had enough?

 
**Martha:**
The Lord says not to spend too much time in pleasure.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
This time we want a place we can all have fun together!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
“Fun for the whole family!” is our motto!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
It's a place to bring families together.
Even your dying grandpa would smile at this place!

 
**Martha:**
Bring families together, huh?
If that's the case, I guess I will stop scolding you.

 
**Martha:**
By the way, did you guys just say something really terrible?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Just your imagination, ma'am!

 
**Martha:**
...If you say so.
What will you be making?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
How about a stadium?

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Like a concert hall?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
How about an amusement park with a goddess theme?

 
**Martha:**
Hmm. I don't think I should be the only one involved in the building decision.

 
**Martha:**
Master, you decide.


## Project 9 Plan A: Let's Build a Stadium
 
**Martha:**
A stadium?
What are we supposed to play here?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Baseball!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Boar piglets are known for their blazing fastballs and curveballs.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
The problem is, we're no good at catching the ball.

 
**Martha:**
That is quite the problem.

 
## Project 9 Plan B: Let's Build a Concert Hall
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
We are going to have a concert here!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
And cancel at the last minute!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
It's so rock'n'roll!

 
**Martha:**
Rock'n'roll?

 
## Project 9 Plan C: Let's Build Neo Marie Land
 
**Marie:**
Neo Marie Land!?
It sounds lovely!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Lovely.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Mighty.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
A five-hour wait for all attractions.

 
**Marie:**
What kind of attractions are available?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
A roller coaster with the great face of our goddess on it!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
A Ferris wheel with the great face of our goddess on it!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Teacups with the great face of our goddess on it!

 
**Marie:**
I see!

 
**Martha:**
Um, Marie?
Don't you think that's creepy?

 
**Martha:**
Especially the teacups. The faces are spinning at ultrafast speed, and it scares me.

 
**Marie:**
W-Well, I don't think so!

 
## Project 10: Let's Build a Tourist Attraction
 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
I have a suggestion, Master!
Why don't we make a tourist attraction?

 
**Mash:**
Um, who's going to come?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Perhaps the ancient gods will someday revive from beyond the horizon?

 
**Mary:**
And you're going to take them to a tourist attraction?

 
**Mary:**
I'll hold my tongue for now.
Tell me what you've got in mind.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
I've always loved the Arc de Triomphe, yup!

 
**Anne:**
You haven't “triomphed” a single time in your life, but I can see where you're coming from.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
A pyramid? They're mysterious, yup.

 
**Mary:**
Do you have any treasure?
None? Oh, I see...

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Fah Fieffel Fower.

 
**Mash:**
Fieffel?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
An Eiffel Tower.
I said it wrong.

 
**Fou:**
...Fou.

 
**Mash:**
Fou seems to be complaining that that was deliberate.

 
**Anne:**
Okay, Master.
Pick the facility you prefer.


## Project 10 Plan A: Let's Build the Arc de Triomphe
 
**Marie:**
Why, it's the Arc de Triomphe.

 
**Mary:**
It's nice, but is this useful for anything?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
If you go round and round, it's so much fun, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Yup!

 
## Project 10 Plan B: Let's Build a Pyramid
 
**Anne:**
Uh-oh. This pyramid is weirder than I expected.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
I modified the design to emit laser beams!

 
**Mary:**
Seriously?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Seriously.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
The only drawback is that it can't withstand any output power, so if you shoot, it will be blown to smithereens for sure.

 
**Mash:**
Smithereens, huh?

 
## Project 10 Plan C: Let's Build the Eiffel Tower
 
**Anne:**
It is very tall.

 
**Mary:**
It's a disgusting French tower.
Really awful.

 
**Mary:**
What is the point of bragging about being tall anyway? It's just tall.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
But if you climb on top, it feels like you are the tallest person in the world.

 
**Mary:**
Mm...

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Would you like to see the view?

 
**Mary:**
M-Maybe I should take a look.

 
**Mary:**
Holy...!! So high!!

 
**Anne:**
I'm so happy that Mary seem to be enjoying it.
Hehehe.

 
## Project 11: Let's Automate Everything
 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
We boar piglets had a thought: to work is to lose.

 
**Altria:**
Well, that's certainly a problematic thought.

 
**Kiyohime:**
How pig-headed.
Shall I roast you?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
L-Let us finish!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
We dreamed of a world where you can eat without working, and came up with a plan!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
This is our proposal document.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Please consider this value-added, forward-thinking, and synergistic solution.

 
**Altria:**
(Sigh) Master, what should we do with this?

 
**Mash:**
My first thought is to throw it away, but let's take a look.


## Project 11 Plan A: Let's Build a Robot Factory
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Nearly perfect automation has been realized.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Now, even without any work, unlimited production has become possible.

 
**Mash:**
How should I put it...it is like the ultimate taboo in civilization.

 
**Altria:**
It's already starting to give me a headache.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
You can laze around all day long, yup!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
It's terrific, yup!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Well, there is one concern, though.

 
**Mash:**
What's that?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
I installed a personality into the AI. We'd be in trouble if a rebellion occurs in the near future, yup!

 
**Fou:**
Fooou!!

 
## Project 11 Plan B: Let's Build an Infinite Proliferation Device
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
A device that produces almost unlimited food has been completed!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Hurrah!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Woo-hoo!

 
**Altria:**
Hmm. That sounds pretty interesting.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
How it works is an industry secret.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
It's not magic, so it's probably fine.

 
**Mash:**
This wording, “infinite proliferation,” gives me a bad feeling.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Soylent?

 
**Fou:**
Fou!!

 
## Project 11 Plan C: Let's Build a Wish-Granting Device
 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
And so, a wish-granting device has been completed.

 
**Altria:**
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
A wish-granting device. With this device, we can fulfill almost any dream we have!

 
**Altria:**
S-So you created the Holy Grail?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
No, this is a wish-granting device.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
If you use this...

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
You can forget about being busy all day long.
You can laze around forever.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
It sounds like a dream, yup.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
It does, yup.

 
**Altria:**
Master, maybe it is best if we destroy this.

 
**Altria:**
But then again, if they're only going to use it for the purpose of lying around... Hmmm.

 
## Project 12: Let's Make an Escape Plan
 
**Edison:**
It's finally time to start work on the invention that will get us out of here!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Waaah!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Terrible news!
Terrible news, yup!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Such a shame...

 
**Edison:**
I know you're reluctant to part with us, but keep it together!

 
**Edison:**
Now, I've come up with several plans.
Master, which do you prefer?


## Project 12 Plan A: Let's Build a Warp Device
 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
A warp device.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
It is a teleportation device that will enable mankind to take a revolutionary leap! Truly a dream come true!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Tyger! Tyger!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
I follow a path beyond love and Haiti!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
No Haiti-ng on rum!

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
That's the good stuff, yup.

 
**Edison:**
(Not listening) Hahahaha! I'm the best!
I am Edison, after all!

 
**Edison:**
Tesla? Who's that? I don't know anyone with such an alternating-current-ish name.

 
## Project 12 Plan B: Let's Build a Rocket
 
**Edison:**
Hahahaha, it's the Edison-style rocket!
Maybe I should've called up Von Braun, too?

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
It is so revolutionary!

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Even with this many Servants, the rocket is still steady as a rock.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
Heracles, Lu Bu, and even Darius can ride in it with no problem.

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
Would it be okay if 100 people were summoned?

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
It should be fine.
Now, go set out into the vast sky, yup!

 
**Edison:**
Oh? What's this screw doing here?
...Oh well, we should be fine!

 
## Project 12 Plan C: Let's Build an Airplane
 
**Edison:**
I thought you would like something classic, so I've been building an airplane and an airport.

 
**Mash:**
They are certainly classic, but...

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
We're also making our costumes, yup.

 
**G：Boar Piglet:**
Attention please, attention please, I say!

 
**F：Boar Piglet:**
That is all you remember, yup.

 
**H：Boar Piglet:**
But I think my skirt is a little short, yup.

 
**Mash:**
That's what bothers you?!

 
**Edison:**
Hahahaha! Let Edison take care of the costumes, too!

 
**Edison:**
What's that, no thanks?
Oh, okay...
