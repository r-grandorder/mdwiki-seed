# Land of Shadows Battleground Blitz - A Cat, a Bunny, and a Holy Grail War

## Land of Shadows Battleground Blitz - Prologue

**Narration:**
The Holy Grail War.

**Narration:**
An event in which seven Masters command seven Servants in a battle to the death. The victor gains the ultimate prize: their heart's desire.

**Narration:**
The rules and scale may vary in each instance...

**Narration:**
...but it always remains a battle for supremacy.

**Narration:**
However, there is more to winning a battle
than simply sending out a Servant.

**Narration:**
To succeed, decisions must be made. Choices must be considered. Commitment is essential. Agony is crucial.

**Narration:**
In other words...experience is key.

**Scáthach:**
So, there you have it.

**Scáthach:**

# Now stand up! Bow!

**Scáthach:**
Very good.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Um, I still have no idea what's going on here...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I have so many questions, but first and foremost:Why are you dressed like that?

---

**Mash:**
I-I'm just as lost as you, Senpai. One moment, we run into Scáthach in the hall, and the next, we're Rayshifting.

**Mash:**
Can you tell us what's going on, Scáthach?
And why are you wearing that costume?

**Scáthach:**
Fujimaru. Mash.

**Scáthach:**
Right now, under these circumstances,
I am not your Servant.

**Scáthach:**
I am your teacher, here to guide you on this new journey.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Teacher? Journey?

---

**Scáthach:**
Indeed. Listen well, both of you.

**Mash:**
R-right.

**Scáthach:**
...
...

**Scáthach:**
...If possible, I would like you to address me as
“Ms. Scáthach.”

**Mash:**
Yes, Ms. Scáthach!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Yes, Ms. Scáthach!

---

**Scáthach:**
Much better.

**Scáthach:**
The road to humanity's restoration is long and arduous.

**Scáthach:**
Humanity has been bleached away, and those of us who remain are once again fighting for our right to exist.

**Scáthach:**
And while your Servants may have plenty of experience on the field of battle, you, Master, do not. At least, not when it comes to fighting as a Master.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I guess I can't argue with that...

---

**Scáthach:**
Indeed, you cannot.

**Scáthach:**
This is no fault of your own, of course. As the last Master of all humanity, you do not exactly have a wealth of contemporaries to look to for direction.

**Scáthach:**
I suppose we could find a few Servants who have also served as Masters if we were to look hard enough, but&ndash;

**Mash:**
Wait a moment, Scáthach.

**Mash:**
Isn't this why we have the simulator? So that Senpai&ndash;Master, can gain the experience [♂ he /♀️ she]
needs for battle?

**Scáthach:**
The simulator does indeed work well for practicing individual battles, but that is as far as it goes.

**Scáthach:**
In a war with all of humanity at stake, we will also need to keep a firm eye on the larger picture.

**Scáthach:**
Let me ask you this, Master. What is the worst thing that could happen in this situation?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Me failing to protect humanity?

**Scáthach:**
Wrong. That would only be the ultimate result of this catastrophe.

**Scáthach:**
The correct answer is your death.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
...Me dying?

**Scáthach:**
Correct.

---

**Scáthach:**
Servants cannot exist without a Master, which makes your continued survival of the utmost importance.

**Scáthach:**
And since there are no other Masters left in the entire world right now, our fate is entirely in your hands.

**Scáthach:**
And since all other potential Masters in this world are on the enemy's side, our fate is entirely in your hands.

**Scáthach:**
As such, it is your duty to
continue winning at all costs.

**Scáthach:**
However, that does not mean you must
always win every battle no matter what.

**Scáthach:**
What good could it do to win
the battle but lose the war?

**Scáthach:**
If you must, at times, flee the field of battle, we can make up those losses later, so long as you yet live.

**Scáthach:**
Today, you will learn from both defeat and victory.
That is the purpose of this Grail Front!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Grail Front?

---

**Scáthach:**
That's right.

**Scáthach:**
That is why I have modeled this environment after my own Land of Shadows.

**Scáthach:**
Needless to say, a loss in this
war will not prove fatal.

**Scáthach:**
But, should you emerge triumphant...

**Scáthach:**

# I will grant you a Holy Grail!

**Fou:**
Fooou!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Just like that!?

---

**Da Vinci:**
H-hold up! A Holy Grail!?
Where in the world were you hiding that!?

**Da Vinci:**
Those are the kinds of things you need to disclose right awa&ndash;

**Da Vinci:**
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on! Did you say a Holy Grail!? You've just HAD one all this time!?

**Da Vinci:**
We can't just have those things floating around willy-nilly. Can you just skip the pageantry and give it to us now!?

**Goredolf:**
I'm just guessing here, but I don't see her just handing it over.

**Goredolf:**
I know that look well. It's the same one Toole always had during her “This is for your own good” lessons.

**Da Vinci:**
Aw man...

**Scáthach:**
Indeed, Chaldea is currently starved for resources, so I can only imagine how desperately you must want this grail.

**Scáthach:**
But, I am the one who found it,
so it is mine to do with as I will.

**Da Vinci:**
Ugh. Why is every hero from the
Age of Gods always like this?

**Da Vinci:**
(Sigh)...

**Da Vinci:**
I'd heard heroes from the Age of Gods were...a lot,
but this is ridiculous.

**Scáthach:**
And of course,
there is a Master on the enemy's side as well.

**Scáthach:**
While there may not be Masters to
be found in every Singularity...

**Scáthach:**
...there is most assuredly one orchestrating the battle somewhere.

**Scáthach:**
Remember, there are other Masters calling themselves Crypters on the enemy's side.

**Scáthach:**
So gaining experience in determining what an enemy commander is thinking will only work to your benefit in the future.

**Mash:**
G-good point. There ARE other Masters on the enemy's side, after all!

**Scáthach:**
As for the Master you will be facing here...

**Scáthach:**
Well, while I do get the impression he is somewhat...unbalanced, he should still suffice as a worthy opponent.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I wonder who it could be...

---

**Scáthach:**
W-well, you will find that out soon enough.

**???:**
Heh.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Ah.

---

**???:**
My name is of little consequence,
but if you must address me, you may call me...

**???:**
Mister M.

**Mister M:**
Yes, that will do nicely!

**Goredolf:**
(Well, the “M” clearly doesn't stand for “Mystery”...)

**Mash:**
So Senpai's goal is to defeat Mister M's Servants then?

**Scáthach:**
Indeed. But unlike the battles you have faced thus far, this will be an intense and brutal series of skirmishes.

**Scáthach:**
Of course, while I have no desire to tell you to fight ceaselessly, even if it should result in your death...

**Scáthach:**
N-no, I certainly do not wish to say that...

**Mash:**
(She wants to say it really badly, doesn't she, Senpai?)

**Scáthach:**
No! I am not going to say it (Biting her lip)
Grr, when did I get so stodgy?

**Scáthach:**
At any rate, since this is meant to provide a special combat experience, I have prepared both real battles and training battles.

**Scáthach:**
The live battles will constitute the Holy Grail War, and for the training battles...take a look!

**Mash:**
All the fighters who came here for the training battles... A ton of materials... A gift shop... Wait! Does this mean...!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Wooo! Roulette time!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Woohoo! Now we're talking!

---

**Scáthach:**
(Obviously proud)

**Scáthach:**
That's right. No longer will anyone be able to mock me by saying my disciples only “graduate” when they die.

**Scáthach:**
In addition to my stick, I have also arranged for,
um... What is it that goes with sticks again?

**???:**
Cannons, woof!

**Scáthach:**
Yes, that's it. For this event, I have arranged for festivities to accompany my harsh training&ndash;the cannon and the stick, so to speak.

**Mash:**
All right, Scáthach, I understand what's going on here now. However&ndash;

**Scáthach:**
Yes?

**Mash:**
Well...

**Mash:**
You still haven't answered the question
we asked you earlier. Namely&ndash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you dressed like that?

---

**Scáthach:**
...
...

**Mash:**
Oh! Does it have something to do with
this Grail Front!?

**Scáthach:**
No, it does not.

**Mash:**
Did you modify your Spirit Origin
using Primordial Runes?

**Scáthach:**
No, I did not.

**Fou:**
Fou fou?

**Scáthach:**
When I awoke this morning, well...
I found myself dressed like this...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That's it!? They're not even trying tojustify this kind of thing anymore!

---

**Scáthach:**
W-well, never mind how I got this outfit.
It does look good on me, does it not?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Well... Yeah, I can't deny that...

---

**Mash:**
While I agree that it does look very good on you...

**Mash:**
...I can't help but think Mas&ndash;er, everyone might find it more than a little distracting!

**Tamamo Cat:**

# That's the point!!!

**Tamamo Cat:**
Sure, it may not be the best thing for Master's moral upbringing, but sometimes, you've just gotta give the people what they want!

**Tamamo Cat:**
A cat can't survive on bargain bin canned food alone. Every now and then, you've gotta crack open the top-shelf stuff.

**Tamamo Cat:**
All of which is to say that Scáthach's brand-new bunny britches are a gift from yours truly!

**Tamamo Cat:**
I was going for something both sexy and deadly, and the bunny has long been known as the strongest of the solitary animals, though admittedly at the cost of dying alone.

**Tamamo Cat:**
Would you like me to whip you one up too, Mash? Who knows? It might help bring back some...dangerous memories.

**Mash:**
M-me!?

**Tamamo Cat:**
Oh, wait. Cat scratch that. I only had enough material on me for Scáthach's.

**Mash:**
I-I see...

**Mash:**
Well, it's not as though I wanted to wear one, but...

**Scáthach:**
I still don't understand.
Why did you make me a bunny outfit?

**Tamamo Cat:**
You have to ask!?
Don't try to hide it from me, Scáthach!

**Tamamo Cat:**
I know how you've been keeping your nose to the grindstone lately. I've got a nose for that kind of thing myself.

**Tamamo Cat:**
I also know that yarn about the elves and the shoemaker, and this cat's never been big on leather.

**Tamamo Cat:**
Which is why I worked my toe beans off to make you that outfit! I always had a feeling it'd look good on you, and besides, you can't take the lead on a big production like this in your usual outfit!

**Tamamo Cat:**
So go on, enjoy it!
Consider it your reward for all your hard work, woof!

**Scáthach:**
I-I see. So this is what they mean nowadays when they talk about practicing self-care!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Hang on. Something doesn't add up here.

---

**Tamamo Cat:**
If you got a problem with my fashion sense, any and all complaints must go through our Servantverse office.

**Tamamo Cat:**
All right then, farewell, my fellow CAGs (short for “Chaldea Animal Girls”)! See you in the finals!

**Tamamo Cat:**
Oh, and if you ever want to make that new outfit permanent, just give me a holler!

**Scáthach:**
...
...

**Scáthach:**
Ahem!

**Scáthach:**
At any rate, you will have a great deal you
must consider over the course of this war.

**Scáthach:**
For example, there is no guarantee that the Servants you are able to summon will be suited to every environment in which you will do battle.

**Scáthach:**
You will need to consider their affinities, their skills, their Noble Phantasms, their personalities, and more.

**Scáthach:**
Will your victories be flawless, or will you only succeed by the skin of your teeth?

**Scáthach:**
Will your losses be painful injuries,
or opportunities for further growth?

**Scáthach:**
You must be prepared for everything to change in the blink of an eye. That is what it means to wage war.

**Scáthach:**
Fujimaru!

**Scáthach:**
From here on out, you and your Servants must think together, fight together, and win together!

**Scáthach:**
Make sure you have a full grasp of your party's capabilities before you head into battle.

**Scáthach:**
Now, are you ready to get started?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Go for it!

---

**Scáthach:**
Good. That is just what I like to hear.

**Scáthach:**
Then with that, let this Grail Front...

**Scáthach:**

# Begin!!!



## Land of Shadows Battleground Blitz - Epilogue

**Scáthach:**
Enough!!!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
O-oh man, I'm exhausted!

---

**Mash:**
Congratulations on your victorious campaign, Senpai!

**Scáthach:**
Yes, you fought well indeed.

**Scáthach:**
Now then, let us gather the other Servants together for a victory party!

**Charlotte Corday:**
Stew's all ready for anyone who wants some!

**Jason:**
Phew, glad that's finally over with. Huh? Oh, you wanna talk performance too? Sure, knock yourselves out. Just leave me out of it.

**Cú Chulainn:**
See? I knew we shouldn't have sent in the Archer here.

**Siegfried:**
In retrospect, the potential rewards of doing so were great, but so were the risks.

**Siegfried:**
Perhaps we should have opened with a different move.

**Iskandar:**
Hey now, don't rule that sort of thing out too quick.

**Iskandar:**
Even if trying to overpower your opponent with brute strength doesn't succeed on its own, it has a knock-on effect of throwing them off-balance.

**Iskandar:**
And you can't underestimate knock-on effects.

**Altera:**
Indeed.

**Altera:**
There is rarely a time when Chaldea is not at a severe disadvantage in this campaign we are fighting, after all. More so when fights are drawn out.

**Altera:**
In some ways, it feels as though we are constantly laying siege to an impenetrable castle. Keeping fights as short as possible is not bad civilization at all.

**Hektor:**
You sure you don't mean “strategy” instead of “civilization”?

**Altera:**
I know what I said.

**Mordred:**
Hmm.

**Hektor:**
Oh, hey, Mordred.

**Hektor:**
Say, you're a Knight of the Round Table.
What do you make of all this?

**Mordred:**
...Well, I like brief showdowns
as much as the next knight...

**Mordred:**
But aren't you guys forgetting that Chaldea's got almost zilch in the way of supply lines?

**Mordred:**
So we've basically got no choice
but to go full guerilla warfare.

**Mordred:**
Forget short-term or long-term warfare.
If I had to sum up our strategy... Hmm...

**Mordred:**
I guess I'd call it general mid-term warfare?

**Mordred:**
So we're prolly better off assessing the situation early on, then findin' an opening in the mid-game and hammering it as hard as we can.

**All:**
...
...

**Mordred:**
What? What is it?

**Cú Chulainn:**
I didn't know you could be so, you know, thoughtful.

**Mordred:**
You want a piece of me, Celt!?

**Hektor:**
Now, now, no need for that.

**Hektor:**
Really, we shouldn't be surprised. Of course the Knight of Treachery would know about that sort of thing.

**Hektor:**
Honestly, I wouldn't have guessed that about you in a million years, but it does make sense when you think about it.

**Mordred:**
You guys want me to Clarent all your asses? Is that it?

**Mordred:**
...Ah, never mind. You all seem like you could take a Clarent to the face and be standing when the dust settled.

**Mordred:**
Hm? Hang on. I just had a revelation.

**Mordred:**
If you can all take a hit from my Clarent,
why SHOULDN'T I go ahead and cut loose?

**Iskandar:**
Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going!

**Mordred:**
Know what? I'mma go for it!
Come to me, red lightning!

**Cú Chulainn:**
Would you just chill for a minute!? Damn!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's just take it easy, okay!?

---

**Mordred:**
Grrr...

**Siegfried:**
Easy there, comrade.
Deep breaths. Deeep breaths.

**Mordred:**
Tch.
...Well? Anyone disagree with me?

**Iskandar:**
Hahaha, of course!
For example, what if&ndash;

**Scáthach:**
Well, as you can see, even some of the greatest heroes in history can have different opinions when it comes to a long and unpredictable war.

**Da Vinci:**
Hmm, hmm...
You know, this HAS been fascinating.

**Scáthach:**
Oho, if it isn't Leonardo da Vinci.

**Scáthach:**
I am glad to see that even an artist&ndash;no, a scientist like yourself can see the appeal of this sort of thing!

**Da Vinci:**
Well sure I can!

**Scáthach:**
Wonderful.

**Scáthach:**
There have been times when I thought our tastes were incompatible, but I am pleased to be wrong.

**Da Vinci:**
Hey, I wasn't known as
THE Renaissance man for nothing♪

**Da Vinci:**
Now hurry up and get back here, Fujimaru!
I want to hear what you and Mash thought of this, too!

**Da Vinci:**
Now I get it.
This really is fascinating!

**Scáthach:**
Oh, the little Da Vinci.
Hehe, was the excitement a bit too much for you?

**Da Vinci:**
Hahaha, maybe♪

**Goredolf:**
Wait. You're not serious, are you?

**Da Vinci:**
But never mind that now.

**Da Vinci:**
This was certainly all very interesting.

**Da Vinci:**
I'd love to hear what you and Mash thought
about all this too, Fujimaru.

**Da Vinci:**
What do you say we have a little confab after you get back?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You got it!

---

**Mash:**
A lot's happened since we came here,
but at least the Grail Front is now over.

**Mash:**
Congratulations once again, Master.
Now, what do you say we head back home!

**Narration:**
Some time later...

**Scáthach:**
...Hmm.

**Scáthach:**
I have an idea for a new Grail Front, but it would involve fierce competition for magical energy resources.

**Scáthach:**
As such, there is no way to know when I may be able to&ndash;
Hm?

**Scáthach:**
What is it?
Is there something going on?

**Marie:**
Oh, hello, Scáthach. Did you see this yet!?

**Scáthach:**
See what?
...A-another Grail Front!?

**Da Vinci:**
There we go.

**Da Vinci:**
The Holy Grail War simulator is now complete!

**Mash:**
Congratulations!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Amazing work!

---

**Da Vinci:**
I gotta say, it took a while to put together,
but I think it'll all work nicely.

**Da Vinci:**
I'll spare you the details, but suffice to say, it runs on recycled magical energy, so it'll still be a little while before we can try it out.

**Da Vinci:**
But hey, once it's all ready, we'll be able to hold events like this on a regular basis!

**Da Vinci:**
There. All done!

**Da Vinci:**
Voilà! The Holy Grail War simulator is now complete!

**Mash:**
Way to go, Da Vinci!

**Goredolf:**
Hmm. I don't see how this is going to be of much use.

**Goredolf:**
I feel like I just wasted our finite and all-too-precious resources on some trivial entertainment...

**Da Vinci:**
That's where you're wrong, Gordy.
This entertainment's anything but trivial.

**Da Vinci:**
Remember, this is a full-blown Holy Grail War simulator.

**Da Vinci:**
Granted, we won't be able to use it until the recycling system gives us some more resources to run it...

**Da Vinci:**
But once it does, it ought to provide some really valuable experiences!

**Scáthach:**
Oho... Oho, oho.
I see, I see...

**Mash:**
Scáthach!

**Scáthach:**
It was a lot of work,
coming up with this Grail Front system.

**Scáthach:**
I had to gather a great deal of magical energy resources as I went around making intricate modifications to a minute Singularity, and now...

**Scáthach:**
...
...

**Scáthach:**
(Sniff)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay, Ms. Scáthach! We still need you to be an advisor!

---

**Scáthach:**
An...advisor?

**Cú Chulainn:**
Yeah, Mentor.
I know the system's already been put together...

**Cú Chulainn:**
...but the enemy Masters and Servants aren't gonna position themselves, right?

**Cú Chulainn:**
So we're still gonna need someone who knows the ins and outs of battle to set things up. Someone like you.

**Cú Chulainn:**
(...That oughta do it, right?)

**Scáthach:**
I see... An advisor, huh?

**Scáthach:**
Right, of course.
Well, in that case...

**Scáthach:**
I suppose my effort wasn't for nothing after all. And if it will help Chaldea bolster its fighting forces further, I certainly have no objections.

**Scáthach:**
Besides, I have already received a fine reward in this outfit. My self-care regimen, if you will.

**Scáthach:**
It seems I am truly in Tamamo Cat's debt. I'll have to be nice to any other cats I meet from now on.

**Mash:**
I agree. Thanks to you and Cat, this first round of the Grail Front as turned out wonderfully.

**Mash:**
On that note, Senpai, it looks like we've got a special new regular event to look forward to.

**Mash:**
Let's make sure they're all as successful as this one!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You said it!
