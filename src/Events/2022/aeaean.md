# The Aeaean Spring Breeze - The Witch, Delightful Companions, and a New Adventure

## Prologue: After Light, After Life

**Narration:**
He and I stand facing each other. Our only company is the deep red sunset and the sound of the waves.

**???:**
There's something I need to tell you.

**Narration:**
He nods silently, waiting for me to speak again.

**Narration:**
We're both imposters through and through&ndash;paper balloons that are destined to disappear.

**Narration:**
But none of that matters now.
What matters now is that I'm here...

**Narration:**
...about to fight.

**???:**
...Here I go.

**???:**
Then show me what you've got!

**Narration:**
In response, I raise my witch's
staff and shout as loud as I can:

**???:**
The goddess in heaven smiles upon me. The mysterious power of the Titans runs through my veins.

**???:**
Their vast wisdom is the wind beneath my wings.
Now behold as I take flight!

**Narration:**
This is the story of how I made peace with regrets
that have weighed on me for countless years.

**Narration:**
...By kicking a whole mess of ass.

## Section 1: Breathe Like It's Monday Morning

**Circe:**
(Sigh)...

**Circe:**
I've been feeling really...uninspired lately...

**Fou:**
Fooou...

**Mash:**
I see Circe's doing nothing but lying on Senpai's bed again...

**Mash:**
Circe.

**Mash:**
If you don't get off [♂ his /♀️ her] bed soon, it'll just be
a matter of time until Senpai comes back and finds
you there.

**Circe:**
Oh, don't worry about that.
I already cast a locator spell.

**Mash:**
I see. But then, isn't that violating [♂ his /♀️ her] privacy?

**Circe:**
Ah, it'll be fine. Besides, I can't help it.
I'm just worried about Master.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Pretty sure you can help it, actually.

---

**Circe:**

Gaaah!!!

**Narration:**

(Falling off the bed)

**Narration:**

(Unsteadily getting back up)

**Circe:**
H-hey there, my beloved Piglet! That's weird.
Why isn't my locator spell working?

**Circe:**
...It was Medea, wasn't it!?
Ugh, she's gotten so spiteful in her old age!

**Circe:**
Who does she think she is, poking her nose into other people's romantic affairs!? This is exactly why she's been single for so long!

**Fou:**
Fou, fooou. (Special Translation:
Like mentor, like student, I guess.)

**Arjuna:**
...Circe.

**Arjuna:**
I understand we are different classes and come from different cultures, and so it behooves us to try to avoid conflict resulting from our differing values...

**Arjuna:**
...but this latest deed of yours has gone one step too far. Go stand in the corner.

**Circe:**
Aw, come on. What are you, a prefect or something?

**Arjuna:**
A prefect...?
Hmm. Yes, perhaps I am.

**Arjuna:**
Osakabehime once told me that there are only two positions for those with white school uniforms like me: prefect, or student council president.

**Mash:**
That's right!
The classic trope from Japanese schools!

**Fou:**
Fou, fo fooou! (Special Translation: Uh-oh. Mash's common sense is becoming dangerously close to UNcommon!)

**Arjuna:**
...But never mind that now.
We just discovered a new minute Singularity.

**Circe:**
...

**Mash:**
!

**Arjuna:**
Mash, Da Vinci asked me to give you a message.

**Arjuna:**
She said she would like you to monitor
Fujimaru during this mission.

**Mash:**
Oh? I'm not sure what's going on,
but I know I can trust a prefect! Roger that!

**Arjuna:**
Mash, I was told to ask you to handle monitor duty for this mission, since Chaldea's staff is still busy analyzing the Lostbelts.

**Mash:**
Understood. Thank you for passing on the message directly, student council president!

**Circe:**
So, where's this new Singularity at?

**Arjuna:**
It's located at...

**Arjuna:**
...Aeaea Island.

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
Say that again?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aeaea Island.

**Circe:**
Ghh... Ngh... Rgh...

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Didn't you used to live on Aeaea Island, Circe?

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
...
...Yes.

---

**Arjuna:**
So you know it already.
Good, that will save us time.

**Arjuna:**
Speaking of time, this Singularity isn't quite situated during the Age of Gods, but it's close.

**Circe:**
Ughhh, why does it have to be THERE of all places...?
I've got nothing but bad memories of that place...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It was that hard for you there?

**Circe:**
...I actually think I had a bad dream about Aeaea Island just the other day.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Why's that?

**Circe:**
Well...
Uh...

---

**Jason:**
Ha!

**Jason:**
You can't fool me. You just want to
take it easy, right? Well, so do I!

**Orion:**
Ooh, ooh, me too.

**Orion:**
Besides, Artemis isn't even here now,
and I sure can't do anything to help on my own.

**Arjuna:**
Putting you aside for the moment, Jason...
What happened to your goddess, Orion?

**Orion:**
All the goddesses are having their own little get-together today, so in the meantime, I'm a free bear. Uh, man.

**Arjuna:**
Then that's all the more reason
we can't leave you behind.

**Arjuna:**
If anything, taking you along will make it
much easier to keep an eye on you.

**Orion:**
What's that supposed to mean!?

**Jason:**
Sounds eminently reasonable to me.

**Georgios:**
That's enough, you two.

**Georgios:**
If Circe doesn't feel like coming,
we can't force her.

**Georgios:**
I'll go.

**Jason:**
Will you now, Georgios?
It's not every day I see you go on a mission.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I was gonna ask Chiron, but...

---

**Chiron:**
I'm afraid my presence could cause Jason undue anxiety.

**Chiron:**
I have the feeling he would get so worked up trying to show me how much he's grown that he would ultimately end up making avoidable mistakes.

**Chiron:**
So if I may be so bold, I suggest you try asking Lord Georgios to go in my stead.

**Chiron:**
I have absolute faith in his ability to keep a party grounded, regardless of how chaotic its lineup may be.

**Jason:**
Say whaaat!?
Are you freaking kidding me!?

**Jason:**
Why would I get anxious just because Chiron was there!?

**Jason:**
Have you lot forgotten I'm the one who captained the Argo through treacherous waters!?

**Orion:**
I know this might sound rich coming from me,
but I can totally see you screwing up like that.

**Arjuna:**
Agreed. I can imagine such a scene all too easily.

**Jason:**
Well, bully for you!

**Jason:**
But, never mind that for now.
So, what's it gonna be, Circe?

**Jason:**
Just so you know, I got no problem
whatsoever with you staying behind.

**Jason:**
It's just a minute Singularity, after all,
so three Servants ought to be plenty.

**Orion:**
What about me?

**Jason:**
What, you thought I was counting you? Do I look like a guy who needs help from a talking teddy bear?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Orion's more levelheaded than you'd think.

---

**Orion:**
Oho, very perceptive of you, Master.

**Orion:**
It's true. I'm very good at taking a step back and seeing the larger picture.

**Fou:**
Fou...

**Circe:**
Uh... As for me, um...
I'm sorry, but...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
It's okay if you're not feeling up to it.

---

**Circe:**
Hm?

**Circe:**
No, wait... I need some time to think.

**Orion:**
(Uh... Why's Ms. Queen Witch just sitting on a corner of the bed shaking like a leaf?)

**Jason:**
Well, ready or not, we're leaving.

**Jason:**
Besides, I'm sure we can make do just fine without a queen witch or two.

**Circe:**

# Wha...!?

**Circe:**
C-c-come on, Jason, don't be rude.
Who couldn't use a queen witch to help them out?

**Jason:**
...All right, let's get going!

**Circe:**
Huh? Wait! Hang on!
I still need more time to&ndash;

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
That felt even faster than usual...

---

**Jason:**
We could've waited all day and it wouldn't have made any difference. Now come on, Queen Witch.

**Circe:**
I knew I had a bad feeling about this.
Ugh...

**Georgios:**
Hmm. This certainly is a lovely place.

**Georgios:**
Just look at the colors of that beautiful Greek sea.
I'd better get a picture of it.

**Orion:**
You know, I've been wondering this for a while,
Georgios: Where'd you get that camera, anyway?

**Georgios:**
I can't say. Photography became a favored hobby of mine before I'd even realized it had happened.

**Georgios:**
Perhaps I wished for it upon winning a Holy Grail War.

**Georgios:**
I kid, of course.

**Orion:**
......Right! Of course! (I can never
tell when serious guys like this are joking.)

**Mash:**
...Oh. That didn't take long.

**Mash:**
It looks like there's a Servant
reading not too far from you.

**Jason:**
So we've got a Rogue Servant, huh?

**Mash:**
Right. They seem to be an unknown Heroic Spirit that
isn't registered in Chaldea's Spirit Origin graph.

**Arjuna:**
We don't yet know if they're friend or foe,
so we'll need to approach them carefully.

**Orion:**
Yeah, sure, makes sense.

**Orion:**
Though you know, a Rogue Servant's
a hell of a thing to call someone.

**Jason:**
What do you expect? They're not exactly wild Servants either, so what we call them should reflect that.

**Jason:**
Now, musclehead types like Atalante or Penthesilea?
Those are what I'd call wild Servants.

**Mash:**
Um, Jason? I feel I should let you know that both Atalante and Penthesilea are here in the Command Room...

**Penthesilea:**
Congratulations, Jason. You have earned yourself a very warm welcome indeed on your return.

**Atalante:**
Please, permit me to be among
those who welcomes you back.

**Atalante:**
Tell me, Jason, what role in such a party appeals to you? A live archery target, or a crash test dummy?

**Jason:**
Dammit Mash, why didn't you tell me who else was there with you sooner!?

**Jason:**
Are you TRYING to get me killed!?

**Arjuna:**
Couldn't you just...not say anything mean?

**Jason:**
Who asked you, Mr. Rational!?
I can't help it if I have opinions I need to share!

**Georgios:**
That sort of thing is exactly what people mean by
“putting one's foot in one's mouth.”

**Circe:**
(Sighhh)... I am so not feeling up for this...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Is everything okay?

---

**Circe:**
Oh, yeah, don't worry.
This is just a mental problem, not a physical one.

**Mash:**
Do you really have that many bad memories associated with Aeaea Island?

**Circe:**
...No, most of them are pretty good.

**Circe:**
But there is one really bad memory that kind of
feels like it's tainting all the good ones...

**Jason:**
You mean Odysseus?

**Circe:**
Cripes! Anyone ever told you you can
be a real insensitive jerk sometimes!?

**Jason:**
Tons.

**Circe:**
Then why the hell haven't you
done anything about it by now!?

**Orion:**
Hey, it was just a matter of time until it came to light, anyway. I mean, your legend's one of the most famous around.

**Orion:**
You know it too, right, Master?

**Circe:**
!!!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You bet.

**Circe:**
Craaap.

**Circe:**
I guess that at least means I don't have to tell you about it, huh? Now come on, let's keep moving!

**Jason:**
Long story short, she basically just got her ass dumped by the guy she was in love with.

**Circe:**
Did you have to put it that bluntly!?
Ugh, guys like you are exactly why I hate human royalty!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Not really...

**Circe:**
Great! Trust me, Piglet, you're better off not knowing!

**Orion:**
Well, I suppose I can take the
opportunity to fill you in.

**Circe:**
Don't. You. Dare.

**Orion:**
It was after the Trojan War had come to an end.

**Orion:**
Odysseus had set sail to return to his homeland...

**Circe:**
You. Little. Bastard.

**Orion:**
...only for him and his crew to end up adrift at sea.

**Orion:**
Eventually, they all washed up here on Aeaea Island.

**Jason:**
But unfortunately for them, that misanthropic queen witch there had been changing every human who set foot on her island into wild animals.

**Jason:**
Boars, lions, wolves, you name it.

**Orion:**
Odysseus's crew fared no better,
as she turned them all into pigs.

**Orion:**
Enraged, Odysseus turned his sword on her, nearly killing her, and she made some quick apologies.

**Circe:**
Urk, ack, gah...
(Writhing in agony)

**Jason:**
After that, Odysseus agreed to stay with her in exchange for her turning his crew back to normal.

**Jason:**
...Damn, now that I think about it, you're a lot better at cutting deals than I realized.

**Circe:**
THAT'S what you're impressed with!?

**Orion:**
However, Odysseus was already married
to a woman named Penelope.

**Orion:**
So once he'd recovered his strength on Aeaea Island,
he decided to resume his journey homeward.

**Circe:**

(Curling up in the fetal position)

**Jason:**
And that's when her ass got dumped!

**Circe:**
Gee, thanks for explaining the most painful episode of my life in excruciating detail, guys! How would you like me to turn you into pigs in gratitude!?

---

**Orion:**
...Hm?

**Orion:**
Hey, Master, is that the Rogue Servant over there?

**Orion:**
'Cause he doesn't look like he's doing too good, what with being sprawled out on the ground and all.

**Jason:**
Those Demonic Beasts sniffing around him don't look like good news, either.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
W-we'd better go save him!

---

**Georgios:**
Agreed. Come, let us be on our way!

**Circe:**
Hang on. I still have something to sa&ndash;

**Jason:**
Will you just help us already!?



**==ARROW==**

**Georgios:**
There we go.
All right, everyone.

**All:**
?

**Georgios:**
Say cheese.

**Jason:**
Okay, I know I smiled on reflex,
but was that picture really necessary?

**Georgios:**
You can't put a price on memories.

**Circe:**
(Sigh) Don't you think we should wake that Servant up and make sure he's okay before we start arguing about photo ops?

**Circe:**
I swear, you heroes never think about anyone but yourselves. Hey, are you okay?

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
Nn?
Nnnnnn?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Something wrong?

---

**Circe:**
Uh, n-no, nothing.
Wh-why do you ask?

**Jason:**
Aha. So his head is shaped funny
because he's got a helmet on.

**Jason:**
We'd better take it off him before he drowns.

**Circe:**
...
...

**Orion:**
Come on, Mr. Georgios, give us a hand.

**Georgios:**
All right.
Up we go.

**???:**
N...gh...
Wh-where am I...?

**Jason:**
Oh hey, you're still alive.

**???:**
Who...are you?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We're from Chaldea.

---

**???:**
Chaldea...?

**Jason:**
Maybe you've never heard of Chaldea,
but what about Jason and Orion?

**???:**
...Yes, I know those names. They are both legendary heroes... Is that who you two are?

**Georgios:**
Not me. My name is Georgios. This tiny bear is Orion.

**Georgios:**
And the man standing there with his arms crossed,
ready to turn tail and run at a moment's notice...

**Georgios:**
...though you wouldn't know it to
look at him, of course...is Jason.

**Jason:**
Hey! Jackass!
Where do you get off ruining my first impression!?

**Georgios:**
And then there's&ndash;

**Georgios:**
Huh?
Where did Circe go?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh?

---

**???:**
...Circe?

**Mash:**
It looks like Circe snuck away
when you weren't looking.

**Orion:**
Geez, the hell was she thinking?

**Orion:**
Okay, you guys better stay here.
Master and I'll go bring her back.

**Jason:**
Ugh, what a slacker.

**???:**
Circe...

**Georgios:**
Circe is the famous Queen Witch of Aeaea Island.
We'll have her take a look at you.


**==ARROW==**

**Narration:**
...For the moment, I decided to run away.

**Narration:**
I don't know how long that moment's going to last...

**Narration:**
...but I had to get away from there,
just so I could breathe.

**Circe:**
Ugh... Great, just great. How come it's always the BAD feelings that turn out to be right!?

**Narration:**
...I always figured he would show up eventually.

**Narration:**
I mean, he's a hero.
A hero's hero, at that.

**Narration:**
It was only a matter of time until
he ended up getting summoned.

**Circe:**
I thought I'd be fine as long as
I avoided running into him...

**Narration:**
Why here, of all places?

**Narration:**
Why did I have to find him on Aeaea Island?

**Narration:**
For that matter...

**Circe:**
Wait. Why did I run away in the first place!?

**Circe:**
It's not as though I did anything wrong.

**Circe:**
And besides, I'm Fujimaru's Servant now.

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
...Man, I really thought I had
this stuff all sorted out.

**Circe:**
Oh shut up! Just don't think about it!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Circe!

---

**Circe:**
Crap. Master!

**Circe:**

(Fiddling with her hair)

**Circe:**

(Poking her cheeks)

**Circe:**

(Looking at her face in a hand mirror)

**Circe:**

(Looking the other way before
turning around with a smile)

**Circe:**
Hey there, Piglet! What can I do for you!?

**Orion:**
How 'bout putting down your damn mirror
and fighting those things already!!!

**Circe:**
What's your problem, fur ball!?
Can't you give a girl time to freshen up!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Okay, but seriously, please get ready for battle now!

---



**==ARROW==**

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, you ready to tell me what's wrong now?

---

**Circe:**
...
...Ghh.

**Circe:**
About that guy we just found on the beach...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You know him?

---

**Circe:**
You better believe it.

**Circe:**
...He's Odysseus.

**Circe:**
He's one of the few heroes
that survived the Trojan War.

**Circe:**
He's the one who came up with the idea for the Trojan Horse, and the one who ultimately led the Achaeans to victory.

**Circe:**
...He never gave up on making it back home to his beloved wife, even after ages spent adrift at sea...

**Circe:**
...and he's the man I once spent some
time with right here on Aeaea Island.

## Section 2: Once Upon a Time

**Narration:**
Once upon a time...

**Narration:**
...there was a very powerful
witch who lived on an island.

**Witch:**
She could do whatever you imagine.

**Witch:**
She could heal people, transform them, make poison,
provide advice, make prophecies...

**Witch:**
There wasn't a thing in the world that was beyond her ability.

**Narration:**
It's true.

**Narration:**
Even though she lived all by herself on the island,
she never wanted for anything.

**Narration:**
Well, except...companionship.

**Narration:**
The fact is, whenever she went for a walk on the beach,
or gazed out at the distant stars...

**Narration:**
...or cooked herself a meal,
or went to sleep for the night...

**Narration:**
...she constantly yearned for another's presence.

**Narration:**
But, she was a witch.

**Narration:**
And no witch could possibly be lonely.

**Narration:**
Everyone who knew her thought as much,
and she told herself the same thing.

**Narration:**
It was a tiny discrepancy in who she was,
but it was still strong enough to be fatal.

**Narration:**
...One day, after some time had passed...

**Narration:**
...a ship washed up on the witch's island.

**Narration:**
The warriors aboard the ship were on their
way home after many long years of war.

**Witch:**
...You know, there's something about
you that reminds me of iron.

**Narration:**
The witch took one look at the ship's captain
and immediately decided she liked him.

**Narration:**
So she thought she would treat him
the same as all the other warriors.

**Mash:**
Odysseus, the legendary hero!? The one who was
not only responsible for winning the Trojan War...

**Mash:**
...but whose incredibly epic journey led to the
coining of the word “odyssey”!? THAT Odysseus!?

**Mash:**
And now, you're telling us he was also your&ndash;

**Mash:**
...I'm sorry.

**Circe:**
It's okay! Just go ahead and say it, Mash.
It's not like the others were shy about it!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
So, he's your ex-boyfrie&ndash;

---

**Circe:**
Don't be ridiculous!!!

**Circe:**
Wait. Then again, maybe it's not so ridiculous?
...But, no, what am I saying. It's not like that.

**Orion:**

...(Sniff sniff) There it is... The scent of pure,
concentrated roman(tic comedy)ce talk.

**Mash:**
Romance talk!?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Romantic comedy!!!?

---

**Circe:**

Gaaah! (Piercing shriek)

**Orion:**
Come on, you, tell us how you really feel!

**Circe:**
I told you, it's not like...

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
...Then again...is it?

**Circe:**
Ugh, great.
Now even I can't tell who I am anymore.

**Circe:**
Me, the queen witch.

**Orion:**
Come on, let's just head back.

**Orion:**
If you still want closure, then tell him.
If you don't, then just leave him be.

**Orion:**
You've got to keep a clear head
even when it comes to romance.

**Circe:**
Great. Now I've got a teddy bear lecturing
me on the finer points of love!

**Orion:**
Hohoho.
(Laughing)

**Orion:**
I might look cute as fluff, but I'm still a seasoned
veteran when it comes to relationships!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Oh, hey Artemis.

**Orion:**

# It's not what it looks like!!!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I doubt you'd be saying that if a certain goddess was here...

**Orion:**
Hyukhyukhyuk.
(Laughing)

**Circe:**
(Might not be now, but I've seen how these things go often enough to know he's not getting out unscathed.)

---

**Circe:**
All right, just give me a moment. I'm going to cast a charm on myself so I don't end up embarrassing, well, myself.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
A charm?

---

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
There we go. All set.

**Orion:**
What'd you just do?

**Circe:**
I put a limiter on my emotions.
It's like being in a constant state of enlightenment.

**Circe:**
Well, maybe “enlightenment” isn't quite the
right word, but it feels close enough!

**Arjuna:**
Oh good, you're back.
What happened back there?

**Circe:**
Oh, you know...this and that.
So, about that guy we found&ndash;

**Arjuna:**
If you mean this Servant,
I'm afraid I have some terrible news.

**Circe:**
Huh?

**???:**
It seems I've lost my memory.

**Circe:**
You mean, you've got amnesia?

**Georgios:**
I asked him a number of questions,
and he doesn't appear to be lying.

**Orion:**
Well don't worry. I can tell you his True Name.

**Arjuna:**
How would you know that?

**Orion:**
Circe told us.
His name's Odysseus.

**Orion:**
As in, the famous hero of the Trojan War.

**Arjuna:**
...I see.

**Arjuna:**
So he is Odysseus.
That would certainly explain his exceptional skill.

**Circe:**
Huh? Tell me you guys didn't
fight him while we were gone.

**Arjuna:**
We didn't have to. I am a warrior.

**Arjuna:**
I can immediately tell how skilled someone
is just from the way they carry themselves.

**Odysseus:**
...I see.
So my name is Odysseus?

**Georgios:**
Has hearing your name shaken loose any memories?

**Odysseus:**
I'm afraid not.

**Odysseus:**
I feel as though I'm trapped
in an impenetrable labyrinth.

**Odysseus:**
Odysseus...
It still doesn't feel as though it's truly my name.

**Georgios:**
Well, this isn't good. Circe, do you
have any elixirs that can cure amnesia?

**Circe:**
Not on hand, but I could make one if I wanted to...

**Circe:**
...
...Ugh.

**Circe:**
H-here, let me take a look at you.

**Circe:**
If we're going to cure you,
first we need to figure out what's wrong.

**Odysseus:**
By all means. Thank you.

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
There're traces of a spell on you.
Can't fix this with just an elixir.

**Circe:**
This means your memories weren't just lost.
They were stolen.

**All:**

# !!!

**Georgios:**
Well, now what are we going to do?

**Georgios:**
If nothing else, I think we can assume that Odysseus
here has a strong connection to this Singularity.

**Odysseus:**
We should also consider the possibility that
I'm actually the one responsible for it.

**Jason:**
Sure, maybe, but that doesn't mean we can
just tie you up and leave you here.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Will you come with us?

---

**Odysseus:**
Of course.

**Odysseus:**
Fortunately, remembering my True Name has helped
me remember how to use my Noble Phantasm as well.

**Odysseus:**
Apparently, I still possess the same common
knowledge and records as other Servants...

**Odysseus:**
...so as long as there is no issue there,
I should be able to use my Noble Phantasm now as well.

**Arjuna:**
Then we're agreed.

**Arjuna:**
Odysseus will work hand in hand with
us to resolve this Singularity.

**Circe:**
...
...

**Mash:**
Are you okay with that, Circe?

**Circe:**
...Yeah, sure, that's fine.

**Odysseus:**
You said your name was Circe?

**Circe:**
Sure is, Odysseus.

**Circe:**
...All right, I guess I can stick around.
At least until your memory comes back.

**Odysseus:**
Thank you. I appreciate your help.

**Circe:**
(Glare)

**Odysseus:**
...
...

**Orion:**
Come on, Circe, can't you be just a little more, y'know...friendly?

**Circe:**
Hey, this is how I've always been. Get used to it.
Okay, let's go, Master!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
You're pulling too hard!

**Circe:**
Don't you know better than to talk
to the queen witch like that!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Circe?

**Circe:**
No back talk.
Come on!

---

**Odysseus:**
...
...

**Odysseus:**
It's great to see a Master and [♂ his /♀️ her]
Servant getting along so well.

**Orion:**
(Doesn't look like he feels
much of anything for her...)

**Circe:**
For the time being, we can start by following the traces left behind by the spell that's been cast on him.

**Circe:**
They're a little hard to find thanks to all
these Demonic Beasts hanging around...

**Circe:**
But don't worry, I've got it covered.

**Odysseus:**
By all means. Thank you.

**Circe:**
Uh, yeah, no problem.
All right, here goes nothing...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
This can't be easy for you...

**Circe:**
You think!?

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Can't stop thinking about him?

**Circe:**
Stop staring at me like that, Piglet!

**Circe:**
You're gonna give him the wrong idea!

---

**Odysseus:**
Is everything okay, Circe?

**Circe:**
I'm fine! Just stay away from me!

**Odysseus:**
...All right.

**Arjuna:**
There's no need to be rude.

**Georgios:**
Is that really any way to behave towards an old friend?

**Circe:**
Khh! A one-two punch from the stuffed shirt brigade!

**Jason:**
I mean, from where we sit, you're just being a bitch kicking an amnesiac when he's down.

**Circe:**
You guys don't get it.

**Circe:**
This guy's practically made out of solid iron.
Bones, muscles, nerves... Everything.

**Odysseus:**
I see. So that is what you think of me...

**Odysseus:**
It's true.
Your words did not hurt me in the slightest...

**Odysseus:**
...because I understand there
is a reason for your behavior.

**Jason:**
Well, well.
He really trusts you, doesn't he, Queen Witch?

**Circe:**
...I oughta cast a pancake curse on
you for smirking at me like that.

**Jason:**
Please don't.

**Circe:**
Hm?

**Circe:**
Hey, sorry to ask, but would you guys mind taking care of all those Demonic Beasts up ahead?

**Circe:**
Sure, we could just go around them,
but I don't want them following us.

**Jason:**
Hmm.

**Jason:**
Guess you're up, Odysseus.

**Odysseus:**
Hm?

**Jason:**
Let's see the kind of Trojan War heroics that put
you on the same level as Achilles and Hektor.

**Jason:**
Of course, Heracles is, and always will be,
the greatest hero Greece has ever known...

**Jason:**
...but you've still got a decent shot at second place.

**Odysseus:**
I see.

**Odysseus:**
True, I suppose a demonstration of my skill in battle may well be the only method I have of proving myself.

**Georgios:**
I can back you up if you have any concerns.

**Odysseus:**
Please do. Even a thousand-to-one chance of losing is more than we can afford to risk.

**Jason:**
So, you're not gonna be all,
“No need. I'll do it myself” there, huh?

**Odysseus:**
With my memories gone, playing the part
of a proud hero would be sheer hubris.

**Odysseus:**
I have no intention of depending entirely on anyone's help, but I will also not refuse it when it is offered.

**Odysseus:**
Fujimaru, I await your orders!


**==ARROW==**

**Odysseus:**
...There. Will that do?

**Arjuna:**
I certainly have no objections.
That was a textbook example of a perfect battle.

**Arjuna:**
Though I did notice you fight more like a tactician than a warrior.

**Odysseus:**
Apparently, that is the path I walked up to this point.

**Odysseus:**
Can you continue tracing the spell now, Circe?

**Circe:**
...
...

**Odysseus:**
Circe?

**Circe:**
Oh, uh, right.

**Circe:**
I was just thinking about how I'd never
actually seen you fight before.

**Odysseus:**
You hadn't?

**Odysseus:**
Since we used to know each other, I would have thought
that included fighting alongside one another as well.

**Circe:**
Aeaea Island was so peaceful that we never had to.

**Jason:**
Because you turned everyone who set
foot on it into animals, right?

**Circe:**
Exactly! I'm not the queen witch for nothing!

**Orion:**
That's not really something to be proud of.

**Circe:**
Incidentally, your crew was no exception.
I turned all of them into animals, too.

**Circe:**
What do you think? Pretty terrifying, right?

**Odysseus:**
No, not especially.

**Odysseus:**
I try not to jump to conclusions before I've examined all the evidence, especially when it comes to judging others.

**Odysseus:**
Besides, I'm a shadow of history now. It would be meaningless to hold on to a grudge I held back when I was alive.

**Circe:**
...
...Hmph!

**Odysseus:**
?

**Mash:**
Circe?

**Circe:**
Sorry, it's nothing.

**Circe:**
I guess this just means...

**Circe:**
...it doesn't mean anything to you anymore, does it?

**Odysseus:**
I am afraid I cannot give you an answer, at least while I am not in possession of my memories.

**Circe:**
...Hehe.
No wonder you're the best tactician in all of Achaea!

**Circe:**
There we go!

**Circe:**
Now that the Demonic Beasts are gone,
I can see the spell's traces more clearly.

**Circe:**
This way, straight ahead!

**Odysseus:**
Great! Let's go!

**Jason:**
I still can't tell whether those
two are getting along or not...

**Arjuna:**
Perhaps it would be better for you if
you left this particular bear unpoked?

**Arjuna:**
By the way, Georgios, what did
you take that last picture for?

**Georgios:**
Oh, that? Those two just looked so good
together that I couldn't help myself.

**Jason:**
So you're basically our acting war photographer, huh...

**Mash:**
Do you think Circe still has, um...feelings?

**Mash:**
For Odysseus, I mean?

**Orion:**
Good question. We won't ever know that for sure unless we pry it out of her.

**Orion:**
Personally, I'd love to give it a try.
It sounds like fun.

**Jason:**
I'm with Orion.
I could really use some blackmail material on her.

**Jason:**
That way, I can be sure she'll keep me
safe if anything really bad goes down.

**Arjuna:**
Ahh, I see. You mean with your wife, Lady Mede&ndash;

**Jason:**
EX-wife! Ex!
She's her own person, and I'm mine!

**Jason:**
I've made it a point to live my life that way,
and I'm not about to change it now!

**Narration:**
...He might not have his memories,
but he's still the same guy.

**Narration:**
I can't tell if I'm upset, relieved, or both.

**Narration:**
Though I guess I can say it's a relief to see that he didn't act any differently around me than he did anyone else.

**Narration:**
He definitely treats me the same as everyone.
...Though in a way, that pisses me off, too.

**Narration:**
Ugh, I hate having all these complicated feelings.

**Odysseus:**
...I see something.

**Circe:**
No way...

**Odysseus:**
This is your island.
Do you have any idea what it is?

**Circe:**
...No, I don't.

**Circe:**
Well, full disclosure, I do know that building...

**Circe:**
But I have no idea what it's doing here.

**Odysseus:**
Hmm... This is becoming quite an interesting problem.

**Circe:**
Piglet! Can you come here, please?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What's up?

---

**Circe:**
Take a look at this.

**Jason:**
Do those stairs lead underground?
Oh no. I've got a very bad feeling about this!

**Arjuna:**
Do you know what these stairs
might be doing here, Circe?

**Circe:**
I've no idea! They were never here before!

**Georgios:**
So we have a clear discrepancy between this place and the true Aeaea Island.

**Odysseus:**
It seems whoever's behind this is practically inviting us in. What do you think we should do, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
We'll just have to see what's down there.

**Odysseus:**
Understood.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Anyone NOT want to go down there?

**Jason:**
Yes! Me!

**Jason:**
In my opinion, do an about-face,
leave this Singularity, and head right back home!

**Georgios:**
Ha ha ha, and what would that solve?
Denied.

**Jason:**
Tch.

**Jason:**
Well, come on, an underground labyrinth? They couldn't be any more obvious about this being a trap if they tried.

**Jason:**
I don't need to go down there to know that.

---

**Orion:**
Well, like it or not, going down there's our only choice.

**Arjuna:**
Very well then, I'll scout ahead.

**Georgios:**
I'll bring up the rear.

**Georgios:**
Master, Circe, and Odysseus will stay in the middle,
while Jason and Orion form the rear guard.

**Jason:**
Hey, great. That sounds easy.

**Jason:**
...
...

**Orion:**
Jason, if you let me die,
I WILL haunt the hell out of you.

**Jason:**
Get out of my mind!

**Odysseus:**
All right, then let us be on our way.
Would you give the order, Fujimaru?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
All hands, we're going in!

**Arjuna:**
Understood.
Go, go, go!

**Arjuna:**
...Why did you make me do that?

**Jason:**
Nobody made you do anything!

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Here we gooo!

**Orion:**
Yeaaah!

**Orion:**
Keep up, will ya!?

**All:**

# Sorry.

---

## Section 3: Systematic Underground Labyrinth

**???:**
Good, they're finally here.

**???:**
It's about time. I was beginning to think
I'd made this Singularity for nothing!

**???:**
...You sure. About this?

**???:**
Sure I'm sure. Don't worry, the plan is perfect.
All you have to worry about is the Labyrinth.

**???:**
She's right, Asterios. Don't worry.
You're in good hands with this witch!

**Arjuna:**
This is...definitely the Labyrinth.

**Mash:**
Right.

**Mash:**
Master and I have been here a few times before, so I can confirm that it's a dangerous place prowled by Demonic Beasts.

**Mash:**
Please be careful as you make
your way through it, Master.

**Circe:**
Who the hell does this person think they are,
building something like this on MY island!?

**Jason:**
You mean it isn't your fault this thing's here?

**Circe:**
Are you kidding? Who in the world would
want to make a tacky labyrinth like this?

**Circe:**
My paradises are strictly aboveground affairs.
The underworld's more my mentor's shtick.

**Circe:**
...Hm? Is that...a signboard?

**Arjuna:**
There's something written on it.
Let's see...

**Arjuna:**
“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”

**Arjuna:**
...That's it.

**Jason:**
...So, who else is ready to head back now?

**Orion:**
You always say that after we go somewhere new!
Not that I disagree this time.

**Georgios:**
There will be no heading back.

**Both:**
Guh...

**Odysseus:**
So, we'll need to risk our lives to proceed, hm?
Interesting. Let's go then.

**Circe:**
Don't you think you should take at least a few
precautions before you go charging into danger?

**Circe:**
Ugh, I swear, you warriors are all the same.

**Jason:**
Come ooonnn, let's just go back the way we caaame.

**Circe:**
Okay, that might not be charging headlong into danger, but it's just as irritating in its own right!

**Jason:**
No, seriously, I'm getting an
extremely bad feeling about this.

**Arjuna:**
I see.
All right, let's be off.

**Georgios:**
That's that then.
Oh, yes. Say cheese.

**Jason:**
Would you lay off the shutter button!?
I keep smiling even though I don't want to!

**Circe:**
What are you nitwits doing!?
Let's go already!

**Georgios:**
It seems we have another signboard.

**Arjuna:**
“Fire walk with me.”

**Arjuna:**
...That's what it says.

**Circe:**
Hmm.

**Circe:**
Oh.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Aah!

---

**Mash:**
Are you all right, Master?

**Georgios:**
Not to worry, Mash.
I made sure those flames didn't get near [♂ him /♀️ her].

**Odysseus:**
Are you okay, Circe?

**Circe:**
Huh?
Wha...? Er?

**Odysseus:**
You were caught in that fire, weren't you?

**Circe:**
I-I-I'm fine! It was nothing!
I'm the queen witch, remember!?

**Odysseus:**
Queen witch or not, surely you can't
be fine after being caught in a fire.

**Circe:**
Well I am, okay!?

**Circe:**
Hecate herself gave me this robe.
It's not gonna burn up in a little fire like that.

**Odysseus:**
Even so.

**Circe:**
Khh...
Well, anyway, I appreciate the concern.

**Orion:**
By the way, anyone else notice we're at a dead end?

**Circe:**
Huh?

**Circe:**
...So we are.
Hmm.

**Circe:**
I bet it's one of those things where the way forward only reveals itself once certain conditions have been met.

**Arjuna:**
“Fire walk with me.”

**Arjuna:**
Hmm...

**Odysseus:**
Walk with me, eh...?
Circe, come with me.

**Circe:**
Huh!? Y-you want me!?
To go with you!? Why should I!?

**Odysseus:**
I just had an idea.
If we are supposed to walk alongside the flames...

**Odysseus:**
...then perhaps that means we need to
proceed while cloaked in this fire.

**Circe:**
What? Don't be silly.
How're we supposed to wear fire?

**Odysseus:**
True, maybe we can't.
But we can catch it.

**Circe:**
?

**Circe:**
...Ohh!

**Circe:**
Master, I know this is short notice,
but we need to fight the fire filling this room!

**Circe:**
We'll then need to bind it before
it goes out and walk with it!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
G-got it!

---

**Circe:**
O flames, I command thee:
burn brighter, fall to ruin, and be reborn!

**Circe:**
That is the never-ending cycle of life and destruction.
Come forth, devilish creatures of flame!

**Georgios:**
Now I see.

**Georgios:**
You turned the fire into an enemy we can fight.
Very clever.

**Jason:**
All right guys, good luck!
I know you've got this!

**Orion:**
(Wow, he's not even pretending like
he's going to join the fighting himself.)

**Arjuna:**
(I'll just go ahead and add this to
the report I'm writing for Medea...)

**==ARROW==**

**Circe:**
There, we got one!

**Circe:**
How's this, Labyrinth!?

**Arjuna:**
It worked.
The wall opened up and there's a new path.

**Arjuna:**
It looks like you had the right idea, Odysseus.

**Jason:**
(Yawwwn)... Oh, are you done now?

**Orion:**
Why did you even come along
if you weren't gonna help out!?

**Odysseus:**
We did it.

**Circe:**
Hell yeah we did.

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
Wait. Who said we could high-five!?

**Odysseus:**
I think I'm starting to understand now.
You are quite strong once you've warmed up.

**Circe:**
Why're you smiling about that!? Cut it out!

**Circe:**
Anyway, the important thing is that the way
forward's unlocked now. Come on, let's go!

**Odysseus:**
Agreed!

**==ARROW==**

**Circe:**
First fire, now ice, huh?

**Arjuna:**
And no signboard this time, apparently.

**Jason:**
Hm? I can see a way forward over there.

**Jason:**
Well, this looks easy enough.
We've just gotta melt our way through that ice.

**Jason:**
Okay Arjuna, go ahead do the thing.
You know, with your bow?

**Arjuna:**
You mean Agni Gandiva?
Unfortunately&ndash;

**Jason:**
What? You don't think you can do it?

**Arjuna:**
Of course I can.
If anything, I'm worried about overdoing it.

**Arjuna:**
If I'm not careful, a single shot from my Noble Phantasm...

**Arjuna:**
...could easily end up destroying the Labyrinth entirely.

**Circe:**
Well, we definitely don't want that.
Not unless you want to be buried alive.

**Arjuna:**
Then I'll hold back as much as possible.

**Arjuna:**
But I'm also going to give it all I've got, just to be sure nobody thinks I'm not up to the task!

**Orion:**
(Ooh, I don't like where this is going.)

**Arjuna:**
Come, Agni, lend me your strength!
This will all be over in an instant!

**Arjuna:**
Agni Gandiva!!!

**Georgios:**
Ooh, now that's a photo op!

**Circe:**
A-aah! All the ice melted!
(Glub glub)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Circe!!!

---

**Circe:**
Oh, don't worry.
It's not a big deal.

**Jason:**
Great. Now we're all completely dren&ndash;

**Jason (0.1 Seconds):**
(Hang on, I just realized something.
Circe's only wearing linen, right?)

**Jason (0.2 Seconds):**
(So does that mean her outfit's see-through right now? And does THAT mean she's...basically indecent?)

**Jason (0.3 Seconds):**
(Not that it matters to me either way...
except for how she might react.)

**Jason (0.4 Seconds):**
(She might act pretty...wacky most of the time,
but she's still the greatest witch in all of Greece.)

**Jason (0.5 Seconds):**
(So she probably wouldn't hesitate to turn any human
that saw her in all her glory into a monster.)

**Jason (0.6 Seconds):**
(And that would mean Master's in danger if [♂ he /♀️ she]
happens to lay eyes on her before she's dry.)

**Jason (0.7 Seconds):**
(Guess I'll just have to take one for the team then. Sorry about this, Master. I'll buy you an ice cream later to make it up to you.)

**Jason (0.8 Seconds):**
(Heh... All that aside, check out how fast I'm thinking. I always knew I could match those gloomy Caster's Thought Acceleration.)

**Jason:**
Oh no! My hand slipped!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Huh!?

---

**Circe:**
Ugh, great, now I'm soaked.

**Odysseus:**
What about your outfit? Are you decent?

**Circe:**
Decent?

**Circe:**
Psh. Who do you think I am?

**Circe:**
I'm Circe! Disciple of Hecate,
and the queen witch of all Greece!

**Circe:**
There's no way I'd ever be caught dead
in see-through clothes!

**Odysseus:**
I see.
Or rather, I can't see.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What happened!?

---

**Jason:**
...I'm sorry. I guess my heroic mind
was a little too sharp in this case.

**Orion:**
I can't believe it! Jason's actually apologizing!

**Arjuna:**
Does that really count as an apology...?

**Circe:**
Anyway, why do you ask? Were you hoping to sneak a peek at my bare body or something?

**Odysseus:**
No, I wasn't.

**Odysseus:**
I just didn't want a young maiden like
yourself to suffer any humiliation.

**Circe:**
...S-s-s-stupid iron man!

**Odysseus:**
Did I say something wrong?

**Orion:**
Eh, that's just how she is. Though I am starting
to get a clearer picture of what's going on.

**Georgios:**
What a lovely candid moment.
Say cheese.

**Circe:**
Piss off!!!

**???:**
Well, that's too bad.

**???:**
I thought her inadvertently baring all would make him feel responsible and start to chip away at that brick wall...but I guess it's just not going to be that easy.

**???:**
But hey, at least they're getting along well.

**???:**
It's true! This is wonderful!
I'm so glad I asked now!

**???:**
So what next?

**???:**
Next... Hehehe.
I think I might have just the thing.

**==ARROW==**

**Circe:**
We've got another signboard here.
What's this one say, Arjuna?

**Arjuna:**
Let's see...

**Arjuna:**
“Destroy the paradox.
That is the only way to the next room.”

**Arjuna:**
“Keep moving forward without looking back.”

**Arjuna:**
The end.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What paradox...?

---

**Georgios:**
Oh, hello. What are you all doing&ndash;

**Mephistopheles:**
Please, you have to believe me.
Both Shakespeare and that statue are lying liars!

**Mephistopheles:**
My door is the only one you can trust!

**Shakespeare:**
Me, a liar? Perish the thought.

**Shakespeare:**
Mephisto there is the liar.
He and the statue both!

**Shakespeare:**
Therefore, it stands to reason that
only my door can be trusted.

**Great Stone Statue God:**
Trust the gods... Trust this god...

**Great Stone Statue God:**
Both Mephisto and Shakespeare are lying liars...

**Great Stone Statue God:**
Trust the gods... The gods never lie...

**Great Stone Statue God:**
Which means my door is the one and only genuine article...

**Mash:**
Um... What's going on?

**Jason:**
Don't ask me, Shielder.

**Jason:**
All I can say is that only one
of these doors is the right one.

**Georgios:**
So we have three people,
each in front of a different door.

**Georgios:**
I suppose this means our task
is to choose the correct one.

**Georgios:**
But the only leads we have to go on
are these three's testimonies...

**Odysseus:**
So this is the paradox.

**Odysseus:**
Somebody here is lying,
and somebody is telling the truth.

**Odysseus:**
Except...is that even possible when we
don't know how many of them are liars?

**Arjuna:**
Good question.

**Arjuna:**
For example, say that Mephistopheles is telling the truth.

**Arjuna:**
By extension, that would mean that both
Shakespeare and the statue are lying.

**Arjuna:**
However, the statue is also telling us that Mephistopheles and Shakespeare are the ones lying.

**Arjuna:**
And here, we have a fatal contradiction.

**Arjuna:**
Because if the statue is lying...

**Arjuna:**
...that would mean both Mephistopheles
and Shakespeare are telling the truth.

**Odysseus:**
Indeed. And the same holds true for all of them.

**Odysseus:**
This results in a paradox.
That is to say, there is no correct answer.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Th-this is breaking my brain a bit.

---

**Georgios:**
So even if one of them is a liar,
and another one isn't...

**Georgios:**
...You're right. It just doesn't work.

**Odysseus:**
Circe.

**Circe:**
Hm?

**Odysseus:**
I'd like to know what you think.

**Circe:**
Hmm. Well, this is definitely a riddle.

**Odysseus:**
Indeed.

**Circe:**
So the way I see it...

**Circe:**
...whoever came up with this riddle's bound to be
a natural-born jerkface of the highest degree.

**Circe:**
Which means there's no point taking this at face value.

**Odysseus:**
...What do you mean?

**Circe:**
The right answer...

**Circe:**
...is to go back the way we came.

**All:**

# Huh!?

**Georgios:**
Oh, on a different note:

**Orion:**
Hey, Teach? Can I get a do-over on that shot?
I just know I was making a really weird face.

**Georgios:**
No, my furry friend.
Once a photo op is gone, it's gone for good.

**Orion:**
Aw maaan.

**Odysseus:**
Circe, what do you mean we need to go back?

**Circe:**
It's simple.

**Circe:**
The signboard's the real liar here.
Those three are just a sideshow.

**All Three:**
Hmph.

**Odysseus:**
The signboard...?
Aha, now I see.

**Odysseus:**
So by “Destroy the paradox.
That is the only way to the next room”...

**Odysseus:**
...it really means “You don't have to destroy the paradox. There's another way to the next room.”

**Odysseus:**
And by “Keep moving forward without looking back”...

**Odysseus:**
...it really means “Turn around and go back.”

**Odysseus:**
So everything is simply the reverse of how it seems.
Apparently I was overthinking this.

**Circe:**
Guess it was a tough problem for
a stuffed shirt like you, huh?

**Odysseus:**
Heh... I can't argue with that.

**Odysseus:**
Though of course, I still can't say for myself
whether I truly am a stuffed shirt or&ndash;Hm?

**Mephistopheles:**
Us, a sideshow!?

**Shakespeare:**
While I cannot deny the truth in your words, neither can I let you simply turn around and leave.

**Great Stone Statue God:**
I...don't really care either way...

**Great Stone Statue God:**
But I also don't like the idea of you guys leaving
while thinking I'm just a big joke...

**Great Stone Statue God:**
So I'm going to crush you, god-style...

**Circe:**
Oh come on!
Why're you giving us a hard time now!?

**Circe:**
Not one of you even likes exerting yourselves!

**Great Stone Statue God:**
As they say, there is an exception to every rule...

**Mephistopheles:**
Here we go!
Iiit's duel tiiime!

**==ARROW==**

**Mephistopheles:**
Whoops! Guess you got me good!
Maestro, some dramatic music, please!

**Mephistopheles:**
Huh? Forget about it?
Oh, fine.

**Mephistopheles:**
Well boo.

**Shakespeare:**
Ahh, what a pity!

**Shakespeare:**
If you had only chosen my door...

**Shakespeare:**
...I would have put you through tribulations great and small before ultimately ushering you to a dead end!

**Great Stone Statue God:**
...
...

**Great Stone Statue God:**
I'm exhausted... I just wanna go back to
Chaldea and lie around doing nothing...

**Great Stone Statue God:**
Oh, right, I almost forgot... I've got a reward
for you guys for figuring out the riddle...

**Great Stone Statue God:**
Faaareweeelll...

**Circe:**
Hey! If anyone's exhausted here, it's us!

**Odysseus:**
I'll say. I never expected to fight other Servants here... Hm?

**Circe:**
What's up?

**Odysseus:**
...Aha. I see.
So I'm Odysseus.

**Circe:**
!

**Circe:**
Did your memories come back?

**Odysseus:**
Partially, yes.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Which parts are we talking about, exactly?

---

**Odysseus:**
Well, I now know my name really is Odysseus.

**Odysseus:**
And I know that I fought in the Trojan War,
which I just barely managed to survive.

**Odysseus:**
...Of course, that's all from when I was still alive.

**Odysseus:**
Though if nothing else, I've also
managed to recover my personality.

**Circe:**
What about me? Do you remember me now?

**Odysseus:**
Hahaha. Sorry, still nothing there.

**Circe:**
...Well, that's okay.
It might even be for the better that way.

**Odysseus:**
You think so?

**Odysseus:**
Personally, I'm still interested to know what
sort of relationship we had when I was alive.

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
All we did was hurt each other.

**Circe:**
You'd hurt me, I'd hurt you, then we'd do it all over again. Nothing good came of it.

**Odysseus:**
...
...Is that really true?

**Circe:**
Yeah, it is.

**Odysseus:**
I see.

**Odysseus:**
Well, I can't argue with that.
Not without my memories.

**Circe:**
What, you think I'd even let you argue with me?
Need I remind you again that I'm the queen witch?

**Odysseus:**
Good point.

**Circe:**
What? What's with the attitude?

**Odysseus:**
Don't worry about it.
This is just what I'm like, apparently.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Those two really get along well, don't they?

**Jason:**
Yeah, I guess.
At least until he gets his memories back.

**Jason:**
The real question is what happens after that.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
What do you think's going on with Circe?

**Arjuna:**
Good question.

**Arjuna:**
I don't think it's as simple as her just hating him or missing him... Feelings can be complicated things.

---

**Arjuna:**
Furthermore, as far as I know,
Odysseus was a married man when they met.

**Mash:**
That's right.

**Mash:**
Odysseus's wife waited a long,
long time for him to come back to her.

**Jason:**
Ah yes, Penelope.

**Jason:**
I heard she was practically swarmed by would-be
suitors while she was waiting for Odysseus.

**Orion:**
Wish I could've got to know her...

**Georgios:**
You would only have been wasting your time.

**Orion:**
Hey, I'm no quitter! As long as I've got a chance, I'm still gonna go for it, even if the odds are a hundred-to-one!

**Georgios:**
Hmm, what a fine masculine expression.
Say cheese.

**Georgios:**
I think I'll call this one
“Orion Proclaiming His Infidelity.”

**Orion:**
Haha, that's funny, Teacher. If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were trying to kill me.

**Georgios:**
Hahaha.

**Orion:**
You're not even denying it!?

## Section 4: Like Iron and Steel

**Narration:**
Once upon a time...

**Narration:**
...there was a man who seemed made of iron.

**Narration:**
He was a beloved hero, devoted to the gods,
possessed of an indomitable will and a powerful soul.

**Narration:**
With a long, protracted war finally behind him,
he was at last ready to return home.

**Narration:**
...He was exhausted.

**Narration:**
Exhausted from war. Exhausted from thinking.
Exhausted from killing.

**Narration:**
As were his subordinates.

**Narration:**
After years and years of battle,
their souls were bruised and battered.

**Witch:**
Then why not become beasts?

**Narration:**
...Perhaps she was right.

**Narration:**
If it would let one live their life with nothing weighing on their mind, becoming a beast could be very fun indeed.

**Narration:**
But one man&ndash;the man like iron&ndash;adamantly refused her offer.

**Man:**
I have to return home.

**Narration:**
He didn't say “I want to go home.”
He said “I have to return home.”

**Narration:**
The witch tried to argue with him.

**Witch:**
Why would you need to leave?
Everything you could ever want is right here.

**Man:**
No.
Penelope isn't.

**Narration:**
The witch was dumbfounded.

**Narration:**
The man was willing to risk his life to go home...

**Narration:**
...all for one woman!

**Witch:**
...No. I won't let you leave.
I'll never let you leave.

**Narration:**
It was the first time she had been so fixated on something in her life. She wanted the man. She wanted to make him hers.

**Narration:**
In her twisted desire to possess him,
the witch proved that she was truly a witch at heart.

**Narration:**
...If only she had wished to simply be with him instead.

**Mash:**
I'm not seeing anything unusual about this room.

**Arjuna:**
Same here. There's no sign, no fire, no ice... Nothing.

**Orion:**
Great. Then we can just keep going.

**Circe:**
Hmm...

**Circe:**
Hey, Odysseus. Try throwing that rock over there.

**Odysseus:**
How's this?

**Arjuna:**
...I take it back.

**Arjuna:**
There may not be any fire or ice here,
but there are invisible lasers.

**Odysseus:**
I'm impressed you noticed those.

**Circe:**
What can I say?
You can't pull the wool over the queen witch's eyes.

**Arjuna:**
Well, what do we do now? Should we go back
the way we came and try a different route?

**Odysseus:**
I doubt that will work.

**Odysseus:**
Taking the rest of the labyrinth's layout into consideration, it's clear that any other path we choose ultimately leads back here.

**Jason:**
...Huh, I just noticed there's a switch on the other side of the room.

**Jason:**
It's practically screaming “You wanna turn
the lasers off? Go on then, flip me.”

**Arjuna:**
All right, I'll give it a shot.

**Jason:**
Huh?

**Arjuna:**
...Hmm. It deflected my arrow. How odd.

**Jason:**
When you said “give it a shot,”
I didn't think you meant literally!

**Jason:**
How about a little warning the next time you pull a stunt like that!? That switch could've been a bomb for all you knew!

**Orion:**
You know, this clarifies something
I've been mulling over for a while.

**Orion:**
At a glance, Arjuna might seem like the kind of
guy who keeps things from getting out of hand...

**Orion:**
...but he's actually the kind who goes around pouring gas on the fires of chaos, metaphorically speaking.

**Arjuna:**
I don't know what you're talking about.

**Arjuna:**
I always keep a clear head, and serve as a calm and collected leader for the others in my group.

**Orion:**
And the worst part is, he doesn't even realize it.

**Circe:**
Hmm... Nnn... Is this it...?

**Circe:**
There we go. Now we can see those lasers no problem.

**Jason:**
Oh good, that makes this much easier.

**Jason:**
All we&ndash;and by we, I mean one of you&ndash;have to do now is run over there and hit that switch.

**Jason:**
It's pretty obvious that that's all
we need to do to clear this room.

**Circe:**
(Sigh) All right, fine.
You guys, wait here.

**Odysseus:**
Are you sure you'll be okay?

**Circe:**
Hm?

**Circe:**
What's that look for?
You worried about me or something?

**Odysseus:**
A little, yes.

**Odysseus:**
Given all the other traps we've seen so far, I have to think there's still more to this one than meets the eye.

**Circe:**
...Yeah, I do too.
But in the meantime, let's see how this goes.

**Circe:**
I'll start by doubling my protective
magical energy field.

**Circe:**
Okay, Master, be right back!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
See you soo&ndash;

---

**Circe:**
Huh?

**Circe:**
Bwah!?

**Circe:**
Ow ow ow ow!
What the what!? The hell was that!?

**Orion:**
Damn. Those lasers all started targeting Circe
the moment she set foot in the room...

**Circe:**
Y-yikes, that was close!

**Circe:**
Those things punched through my multiple protective
fields like they were nothing!

**Circe:**
I think my clothes and hair are a little singed!

**Odysseus:**
Are you okay?

**Circe:**
I'm fine! But now what do we do?

**Circe:**
Whoever set this room up obviously
doesn't actually want us to clear it!

**???:**
Come now, that's not true.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I recognize that beautiful voice...!

---

**Euryale:**
Good day, everyone. I am what happens when beauty, chastity, and purity all decided to put on a dress and walk around.

**Euryale:**
Yes, it is I, the goddess Euryale.
What? You got a problem with that description?

**Odysseus:**
Problems, no. Doubts, yes.

**Euryale:**
Oh my, I'm so scared. You look like a hunter eyeing his prey. So you're a warrior with brains AND bravery, huh?

**Euryale:**
I swear, you human so-called heroes. I can't tell any difference between you and your everyday barbaric warrior.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Why are you doing this?

---

**Euryale:**
...
...

**Euryale:**
So, how would you like me to tell you
how you can get through this room?

**Jason:**
(She just straight up ignored [♂ him /♀️ her]!)

**Euryale:**
This trap&ndash;I mean, trial, requires two people
to work together in perfect sync.

**Euryale:**
You'll need to both step on the same floor tile at the same time, and evade the lasers like you're dancing a waltz.

**Euryale:**
Here, I even wrote down the exact instructions for you. Take a moment to memorize them.

**Circe:**
G-geez, this looks pretty tough.

**Euryale:**
It may be complicated, but it's not impossible.
Trust me. I am a goddess, after all.

**Orion:**
That's funny, 'cause if there's one thing I know about
goddesses, it's that they're NOT to be trusted.

**Euryale:**
Did you say something?

**Orion:**
(Doing his best teddy bear impression)

**Odysseus:**
...May I ask you a question, Euryale?

**Euryale:**
What is it?

**Odysseus:**
All the other traps we've seen so far included
some sort of hint on how to get past them.

**Odysseus:**
So why did you not include a hint for this trap?

**Euryale:**
You think I need a reason?
Don't get too full of yourself, human.

**Euryale:**
Those hints were but the merciful whims of a goddess.

**Euryale:**
I offer hints if and when I feel like it. End of story.

**Asterios:**
Found sign. You lost. Euryale!

**Asterios:**
Here!

**Euryale:**
Hey! Can't you see I'm in the middle of a call here!?

**Euryale:**
...Anyway, there's your answer!

**Jason:**
Now I see. So basically, you just goofed up.

**Arjuna:**
...Hmm.

**Arjuna:**
In that case, this will all come down to
who can best match Circe beat for beat.

**Arjuna:**
Master is automatically out, of course.
We can't risk putting [♂ him /♀️ her] in any danger.

**Arjuna:**
So that just leaves us.

**Jason:**
Me? Stay in sync with Circe? Queen Witch Circe?

**Jason:**
Yeah, that's never happening.

**Orion:**
Same goes for me.

**Georgios:**
Considering that Arjuna and I come from
very different times and cultures...

**Georgios:**
...Odysseus would seem the most sensible choice.

**Circe:**
...Forget it.

**Georgios:**
Why?

**Circe:**
I can't explain why.
I just don't like it.

**Circe:**
If I teamed up with Odysseus here, it would feel like the gods&ndash;er, god, has me dancing right in the palm of her hand!

**Orion:**
Well, yeah, in one sense, you definitely would be,
but come on, this is no time to be selfish.

**Circe:**
I said forget it!

**Jason:**
Ugh. Go on, Master, give her a good scolding.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
If Circe doesn't want to, we can't force her.

**Jason:**
We can't!?

**Circe:**
Ghh... D-dammit. Now that you've said that...

**Circe:**
...it really does make me feel
like I'm just being selfish.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
So if not Odysseus, who would you be willing to dance with?

**Circe:**
Hmm...

**Circe:**
Well, definitely not Jason or Orion.
I mean, talk about being out of the question.

**Jason:**
What was that!?

**Jason:**
I don't have any intention of teaming up with you either, but that doesn't mean I'm out of the question!

**Orion:**
I've never been so humiliated!

**Circe:**
Medea.

**Jason:**

Urk.

**Circe:**
Lady Artemis.

**Orion:**

Urk.

**Circe:**
As for Arjuna and Georgios...

**Circe:**
Nnn, something tells me we wouldn't
be able to stay in sync very well...

**Georgios:**
I am uncertain how much basis that opinion has in fact, but I still agree.

---

**Circe:**
So it looks like...
Nnn...

**Circe:**
You really are the only choice...

**Circe:**
I guess...

**Odysseus:**
So it would seem. But at least neither of us has anything to be embarrassed about at this point.

**Odysseus:**
After all, we're already dead.

**Circe:**
Well, yeah, I know...
But it's still complicated for me, all right!?

**Odysseus:**
This is what we have to do to make
our way through the Labyrinth.

**Odysseus:**
...I'm sure you have your reasons for disliking me...

**Odysseus:**
...but I hope you can put them aside,
at least for the moment.

**Circe:**
See!? That, right there!
THAT'S what I don't like about you!

**Odysseus:**
Unfortunately, this seems to just be who I am.

**Circe:**
...(Sigh)

**Circe:**
Man, I'm glad I put these limiters on my feelings.
We could've ended up killing each other here otherwise.

**Circe:**
All right, I've had enough. Besides, we'll never get
anywhere if I keep going in circles like this.

**Circe:**
Let's go, Odysseus.
You'd better be able to keep up with me.

**Odysseus:**
Understood.

**Circe:**
...Make sure you stick close.

**Odysseus:**
How's this?

**Circe:**
That's too close, you idiot!
Back off a little.

**Circe:**
Okay, here goes.
Let's see...

**Circe:**
First, we step here.

**Odysseus:**
...I see. We just barely managed to dodge it.
It appears the goddess was telling the truth.

**Circe:**
We're not done yet.
Left! Right! Center!

**Circe:**
Duck! Jump!
Together and turn!

**Jason:**
They really do work well together.
I knew this was the right call.

**Circe:**
NO COMMENTS FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY!

**Circe:**
One, two, three...
And turn!

**Mash:**
It really does look like ballroom dancing.

**Circe:**
Hey, this isn't as easy as we make it look!
We're fighting for our lives out here!

**Odysseus:**
Indeed.

**Odysseus:**
If a goddess is behind this disturbance,
then these lasers must pack quite a punch.

**Circe:**
Duck!

**Odysseus:**
Riiiight!

**Jason:**
Hahaha, looks like Odysseus is
fighting pretty desperately too&ndash;

**Jason:**
...Hey. How did a lock of my prized blond hair just burn away?

**Jason:**
Are you telling me this is an actual death trap!?

**Circe:**
Why do you think we're fighting
for our lives right now!?

**Georgios:**
All that said, it really is a lovely dance.

**Georgios:**
Okay, you two, let's see those pearly whites.

**Odysseus:**
Now!?

**Circe:**
Fine! You want us to smile? We'll smile!
But we're also gonna duck...now!

**Circe:**
There, we made it!
Time to shut this thing down!

**Arjuna:**
It looks like the lasers are gone.
Shall we be on our way then?

**Arjuna:**
Hm?

**Circe:**
Guess it was too much to hope we wouldn't
have to fight another battle, too.

**Odysseus:**
I see the goddess wasn't exaggerating about her whims. All right then, we'll just have to end this quickly.


**==ARROW==**

**Odysseus:**
Hm?
Interesting...

**Circe:**
Did you just get some more memories back?

**Odysseus:**
I did. All of them, in fact.

**Odysseus:**
Well, with one exception:
I still don't know why I was summoned here.

**Odysseus:**
But never mind that now.

**Odysseus:**
...Circe.
You're Circe, aren't you?

**Circe:**
What, you finally remembered who I am?

**Circe:**
That's right. It's me, Circe.
The queen witch of Aeaea Island.

**Odysseus:**
I'm glad to finally recognize you again.
...It's been a long time, hasn't it?

**Circe:**
Well, sorry to burst your nostalgia bubble...

**Circe:**
...but I'm not as touched by this impromptu
reunion as you are. Hehehe.

**Odysseus:**
Did you seal your emotions away with magecraft again?

**Circe:**
Again?

**Odysseus:**
You did that a number of times when I was here, too.

**Circe:**
Whoa, really?
What was I like then?

**Odysseus:**
You mean you don't remember?

**Circe:**
Uh, no. Not at all.

**Odysseus:**
...To be honest, I don't know if
I can bring myself to tell you.

**Circe:**
And why is that!?

**Odysseus:**
Hahahaha. Forgive me, I was only joking.

**Circe:**
...
...?

**Circe:**
Hey, Odysseus, let me ask you something.
What do you think of me?

**Odysseus:**
Good question.

**Odysseus:**
You are the proud queen witch,
and a wise sage knowledgeable in all things.

**Odysseus:**
I only wish you would do something about your habit of turning people into animals.

**Circe:**
Hmph.
I'll have you know I'm selective about who I turn.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Really!? You are!?

---

**Circe:**
Aah! Master!

**Arjuna:**
To be perfectly honest, Circe...I've always thought
you would turn anyone and everyone into pigs.

**Georgios:**
Indeed, I've long had the same impression.
Do you actually have some sort of criteria?

**Circe:**
Sure I do!

**Circe:**
But I'm not gonna tell you guys what it is.

**Odysseus:**
That's all right.
I already know what your criteria is.

**Circe:**
You do!? How?
I didn't think I ever told anyone.

**Odysseus:**
Well, it's only a guess on my part, and I could be wrong.

**Odysseus:**
But regardless, I'll keep it to myself,
since I'm sure you'd prefer it remain a secret.

**Circe:**
...Hmph.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
(So they've got their own little secret!)

**Mash:**
(Y-yes, it's very exciting, isn't it, Senpai?)

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Really, criteria or not, I wish you'd juststop turning people into pigs altogether...

**Circe:**
Sorry, but I'm not gonna give it up now.
Turning people into piglets is kind of my thing.

**Jason:**
Why don't you try being turned into a piglet
yourself and see how YOU like it!?

---

**Georgios:**
Hmm...

**Odysseus:**
Another photo, Georgios?

**Georgios:**
I just had to capture that wonderful expression on your face.

**Odysseus:**
I see. I'll take that as a compliment.

**Odysseus:**
Now then, let's go see the goddess who stole my
memories and made this Singularity, shall we?

**Odysseus:**
Once we do that, this case will be firmly closed.
I think.

**Circe:**
...Okay. Then let's get going!

**Odysseus:**
But first...I'm feeling rather hungry.

**Odysseus:**
As a Rogue Servant, I apparently don't have
enough magical energy to sustain myself.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
What can we do?

**Odysseus:**
Forming a contract would be the
quickest way to remedy it, but&ndash;

**Arjuna:**
I don't think that would be very wise.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
Want to form a contract then?

**Odysseus:**
...No, I'd better not.

---

**Odysseus:**
Minute or not, a goddess is still
involved with this Singularity.

**Odysseus:**
So you shouldn't go around forming contracts with Servants unless you're absolutely sure you can trust them.

**Arjuna:**
Does that mean you don't even
trust yourself?

**Odysseus:**
That's right. I don't.

**Circe:**
In that case, maybe a meal could replenish your magical energy? And I've got just the dish in mind! It's&ndash;

**All:**

# Kykeon.

**Circe:**
Right you are!

**Jason:**
Great, kykeon...

**Circe:**
What? Why do you look so glum about it?

**Odysseus:**
I'm not glum. I'd be very happy to
have it again for the first time in ages.

**Circe:**
Right? I figured this kind of thing might happen.

**Circe:**
Which is why I never go anywhere
without my kykeon-made-kwick kit.

**Jason:**
What situation could you have possibly imagined that would call for such a thing?

**Arjuna:**
Very well then, let's take a short
break while Circe makes her kykeon.

## Section 5: The Calamity Called the Queen Witch

**Narration:**
No matter how much time passed, or how many meals
they shared, the man did not change his mind.

**Man:**
I'm leaving.

**Witch:**
I won't let you.

**Narration:**
Each time, the same statements.
Each time, the same responses.

**Witch:**
Why do you want to go home so badly?

**Witch:**
The woman you loved must be married
to someone else by now.

**Man:**
...That is not the issue.
Yes, I will be sad if she is, but it doesn't matter.

**Man:**
I'm going because I love her.

**Man:**
Even if we are no longer wed...
Even if my return should lead to nothing but regret...

**Man:**
I'm going home because it's where we belong.
If we have to risk our lives to get there, so be it.

**Narration:**
No matter how many times they talked,
they always found themselves at an impasse.

**Narration:**
Perhaps the witch finally gave up.
Perhaps the man finally shook her off.

**Narration:**
Perhaps they argued, raged, or swore at each other.

**Narration:**
But regardless of how it happened,
their relationship came to an end.

**Narration:**
Before he left, the witch granted the man's request
for knowledge of his journey to come...

**Narration:**
...but she was still unable to bring herself
to say the one thing that truly mattered.

**Narration:**
With the sky bloodred from the setting sun,
the man set off without a word.

**Narration:**
As she watched him leave, tears spilled down the witch's cheeks. She felt a pain in her chest as though she'd been stabbed through the heart.

**Witch:**
...Why?
Why did you leave me?

**Narration:**
There was nothing the witch could not do. If she wished, she could have anyone's heart she desired.

**Narration:**
Anyone, that is...except the man she loved.

**Narration:**
And here is where this story comes to an end.

**Narration:**
In time, both the hero and the witch would be inscribed upon the tapestry of myth...

**Narration:**
...and ascend to the rank of Heroic Spirit.

**Circe:**
Okay, kykeon's ready! It's a special batch I whipped
up to help you replenish your magical energy.

**Odysseus:**
Oho, I haven't had this in forever.

**Odysseus:**
Mmm, delicious. It's just as good as
I remember from when I was alive.

**Circe:**
Teehee. (Triumphant look)

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
More, please!

**Circe:**
But of course!
Go on, eat as much as you like.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's usually at about this point that someone...

**Circe:**
You can't live your life thinking everything you eat's been tampered with, Piglet! That's just being paranoid!

---

**Orion:**
Oh man, this is really good.
And the honey is so sweet.

**Jason:**
Hmm, I see. So you really are more bear than man now.

**Orion:**
Don't even joke about that!

**Orion:**
Don't you know how tragic it is for people to
be turned into animals in Greek mythology!?

**Georgios:**
Thou art a bear, and thus, thou must have sinned.

**Orion:**
Not you too, Teacher!?

**Georgios:**
Hahaha, I'm just kidding.

**Arjuna:**
What's so tragic about being turned into an animal, Orion?

**Orion:**
You mean you don't know? Okay, I'll tell you. There's plenty of examples to draw on from our corner of the world.

**Orion:**
There's King Lycaon, who Zeus turned into a wolf
and banished for killing his own infant son.

**Orion:**
There's Actaeon, who got turned into a stag and
eaten just because he happened to see Artemis bathing.

**Orion:**
There's Callisto, who got turned into a, um...bear...

**Georgios:**
Indeed, tales of transformation are found
in legends all throughout the world.

**Georgios:**
People are said to have been turned into wolves, serpents, bears...and of course, dragons, like in Fafnir's case.

**Georgios:**
Incidentally, bears are said to symbolize lechery.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I can totally see that.

---

**Orion:**
Me too... No, wait!
I can't let myself see that!

**Georgios:**
However&ndash;and this may be because pigs have long been kept as livestock...

**Georgios:**
...it is rare for people to be
turned into pigs, even in myth.

**Georgios:**
Though there is Kamapuaʻa,
the god of pigs in Hawaii...

**Circe:**
For the record, my pigs aren't livestock OR gods.

**Jason:**
By the way, Circe...

**Jason:**
You put those emotion limiters on and all,
but could they ever come off?

**Circe:**
Hahahaha, naw, no way they'd come off.

**Circe:**
Still, that being said...

**Circe:**
...I guess they could technically come off on their own if I were to experience a really huge emotional upheaval or something.

**Jason:**
Hmm. And what would happen if
they came off on their own?

**Circe:**
Well, with the caveat that
it's never happened before...

**Circe:**
All the emotions that had been held back up to that point would come bursting to the surface...

**Circe:**
...and I'd have just as much control over them as a child. Which is to say, none.

**Orion:**
(How's that any different from her usual?)

**Circe:**
But anyway, it's never gonna happen, so don't
worry about it. Care for kykeon seconds?

**Odysseus:**
Yes, please.

**Orion:**
Kykeon seconds?

**Arjuna:**
I'd like some curry flavored kykeon, myself...
Well, honestly, I'd just like actual curry...

**Jason:**
Then have some after we get home!

**Arjuna:**
You know, I think I will.

**Jason:**
All that aside...

**Jason:**
It's a little surreal, seeing you all sitting on the floor of the Labyrinth eating kykeon.

**Georgios:**
It does feel rather avant-garde. I think I'll take some photos to commemorate the occasion.

**Circe:**
Think I could get a copy of those pics?

**Georgios:**
Of course. Just let me know which ones you want.

**Circe:**
'Kay.

**Odysseus:**
All right then, shall we get going?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Man, it's spacious in here...

---

**Mash:**
I'm seeing two... No, three Servant readings
in here, Master. Please be careful.

**Jason:**
...
...

**Jason:**
Hey, Master? I know this is short notice,
but is it okay if I leave now?

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
But we just got here!

---

**Jason:**
I know, but I've got a reaaally bad feeling about
this place! Oh crap, oh crap! I'm outta heeere!

**Georgios:**
Caught you.

**Arjuna:**
And release.

**Jason:**
Argh! Stupid stuffed shirts!

**Odysseus:**
Are you the ones who stole my memories
and created this Singularity?

**Euryale:**
That's us, yes.

**Asterios:**
It was. Hard work.

**Arjuna:**
I see. Asterios's involvement would certainly
explain the presence of the Labyrinth.

**Euryale:**
That being said...we're only accomplices.
This wasn't our idea, actually.

**Euryale:**
It was hers.

**Circe:**
Huh? Who are you talking about?

**???:**
Me, Auntie!

**Circe:**
...
...

**Circe:**
...Auntie? Did you just call ME “Auntie”!?

**Circe:**
No, wait. The only one who would
ever call me “Auntie” is&ndash;

**Medea Lily:**
Hello, Auntie!

**Circe:**
Meeedeeeaaa!!!

**Medea Lily:**
That's me! Hello!

**Medea Lily:**
And a very fine hello to you too, Lord Jason!
Greetings! Good day! Salutations!

**Jason:**
Gaaah! I knew it!
I knew this had your fingerprints all over it!

**Jason:**
Medea!

**Medea Lily:**
That's right!

**Medea Lily:**
I'm the one who used a Holy Grail
to make this Singularity!

**Mash:**
Wow, it's so rare to have a culprit be so...forthcoming. Honestly, I'm not quite sure how to respond...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Isn't Medea Circe's&ndash;

**Orion:**
Yeah, she used to be her apprentice back in the day.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
It's always the witches you least suspect...

**Jason:**
I thought she'd been awfully quiet lately.
So this is what she was plotting...

---

**Odysseus:**
...May I ask why you did this?

**Medea Lily:**
Hmm. I guess I can tell you that...

**Medea Lily:**
But first, there's something else we should do:

**Medea Lily:**
Fight!

**Odysseus:**
I suppose that does keep things simple.

**Medea Lily:**
Indeed.

**Medea Lily:**
All right, let's begin. I am Medea, princess of Colchis, first disciple of Hecate...

**Medea Lily:**
...and the devoted witch who has dedicated her
life to the pursuit of magic. Now have at you!


**==ARROW==**

**Euryale:**
Guess this is it.
That's enough, Asterios.

**Asterios:**
'Kay.

**Medea Lily:**
Thank you, you two.

**Euryale:**
No problem. It was fun coming up with those traps.

**Euryale:**
Come on, Asterios, let's go.
Give me a ride, will you?

**Asterios:**
Got it.

**Asterios:**
Bye-bye, Master!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Bye-bye!

---

**Odysseus:**
All right, I think it's time you came clean.
Why did you do this?

**Medea Lily:**
Okay, I'll tell you!

**Circe:**
Oh man, I've got a really bad feeling about this...

**Medea Lily:**
I did this to help you and Auntie Circe get closer!

**Odysseus:**
...
...

**Odysseus:**
...I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that?

**Medea Lily:**
Sure.

**Medea Lily:**
I wanted you and Auntie Circe to get closer!

**Circe:**
S-s-s-say whaaat!?

**Medea Lily:**
Auntie Circe...

**Medea Lily:**
You might not remember this very well...

**Medea Lily:**
...but whenever you get really, reeeally drunk,
you just talk nonstop about Odysseus.

**Circe:**
Bwuhhh!? (No recollection whatsoever)

**Medea Lily:**
Back when you were alive, there were all sorts of things getting in your way.

**Medea Lily:**
Your respective social positions as hero and witch, king and goddess...

**Medea Lily:**
But now that you're both Servants, you can enjoy your
relationship without worrying about any of that, right?

**Medea Lily:**
Just like me and Lord Jason!

**Jason:**
Huh? (I don't think we're especially close now,
nor do I really want to be&ndash;)

**Orion:**
Keep your mouth shut, will you!?
This is all complicated enough already!

**Odysseus:**
...
...I see.

**Circe:**
TH-THAT'S why you went to such ridiculous lengths!?

**Medea Lily:**
Yep!

**Medea Lily:**
If I hadn't, I'm certain you'd end up spending your whole materialization at Chaldea moaning about this.

**Circe:**
Oh man, I seriously don't remember any of that...

**Odysseus:**
All that being said, I can't help but think that
stealing my memories was a step too far.

**Medea Lily:**
You're right, and I do apologize profusely for that.

**Medea Lily:**
But I'm afraid I had no other choice.

**Medea Lily:**
In every scenario I simulated, you two always ended up
on the outs whenever you started with all your memories.

**Circe:**
The outs?
...Oh no!

**Circe:**
Medea... Please don't tell me you still
have yet to return THOSE memories to him?

**Medea Lily:**
I, uh...

**Circe:**
...
...

**Odysseus:**
What do you mean?
Am I still missing some of my memories?

**Medea Lily:**
But, as long as she's around...

**Circe:**
Medea.

**Circe:**
...Look. While I do like the very witchy way you took
the shortest and most crafty path to your goal...

**Circe:**
...this is still something for Odysseus and I to work out on our own. Now give him back the rest of his memories.

**Circe:**
Think of it as rewarding him for
winning our battle if you have to.

**Medea Lily:**
Okay...

**Circe:**
Besides, when you get right down to it,
that isn't the part I'm hung up on.

**Medea Lily:**
Well then, let me return your memories.

**Odysseus:**
G-good. Thank you.

**Odysseus:**
...I...

## Section 6: Hello My Love, and Goodbye

**Narration:**
Hop, step, change.
From woman to witch, and from witch to goddess.

**Narration:**
As a goddess, the woman loved humans deeply,
and tried to care for them.

**Narration:**
As a witch, she tried to trick and control them.

**Narration:**
But in the end...neither worked out.

**Narration:**
She was far too human to call a goddess,
and far too soft to call a witch.

**Narration:**
And yet, she was cruel and selfish,
commanding terrifying magecraft.

**Narration:**
The hero and the witch stand facing each other. Their only company the deep red sunset and the sound of the waves.

**Hero:**
I won't ask for your forgiveness.

**Witch:**
...
...

**Hero:**
Farewell, O great witch.
I am grateful for the days I spent here.

**Witch:**
...
...!

**Witch:**
That's not what I want to hear from you!!!

**Hero:**
...Be that as it may, I am still going.
I have to.

**Narration:**
...Ugh, this is the worst.

**Narration:**
All the emotions I'd been holding back
groaned and cracked under the strain.

**Narration:**
This isn't what I wanted to say.
This isn't what I wanted to tell him.

**Narration:**
But back then, I had my hands full picking
up the pieces of my shattered feelings.

**Narration:**
By the time I realized I'd lost my chance,
we'd already said our farewells.

**Odysseus:**
...
...

**Odysseus:**
...Penelope!

**Circe:**
...That's better.
Ugh, I swear...

**Odysseus:**
...I genuinely don't know whether
to be angry or devastated.

**Medea Lily:**
I'm very sorry.
But you see&ndash;

**Circe:**
Yeah, yeah, that's enough out of you, Medea.
It's time for you to leave.

**Circe:**
Don't worry, I'll give you one hell of an earful when we get back to Chaldea!

**Medea Lily:**
I'm sooorryyy.

**Circe:**
I wonder if she actually learned her lesson this time.
Somehow, I doubt it...

**Odysseus:**
But it is nice to see that your
apprentice cares so much for you.

**Circe:**
All right, Odysseus, I've got something
I want to say to you.

**Odysseus:**
...And I to you.

**Circe:**
Well, there's no need for us to stick around here.

**Circe:**
Besides, the whole Labyrinth's gonna come
down soon anyway now that Asterios is gone.

**Circe:**
Oh, you and the others can go on ahead, Master.
I'll catch up to you later.

**Circe:**
...
...

**Odysseus:**
...
...

**Circe:**
I've always loved the sound of the waves.

**Odysseus:**
Indeed. It's lovely.

**Circe:**
You know, it's weird.

**Circe:**
I never thought that way back when I was alive.
This sea really kept me tied down.

**Odysseus:**
Do you mean this island was your prison?

**Circe:**
Never mind that I was the one who chose to be here.

**Circe:**
...Now what was the word for this
sort of thing again? Ambivalence?

**Odysseus:**
That's just what it is to be human.

**Circe:**
I used to hate you, you know.

**Odysseus:**
I see.

**Circe:**
You disturbed the peaceful arrangement I'd made for myself. And you also threatened me with your sword.

**Odysseus:**
As I recall, I only did that because
you turned my crew into pigs.

**Circe:**
Careful there. Don't poke the boar unless
you're ready to face the tusks.

**Odysseus:**
...I didn't dislike you.

**Circe:**
Ahahaha! That's a hell of a way to put it.

**Circe:**
I know you didn't hate me.
You even liked me.

**Circe:**
...But you didn't love me...

**Odysseus:**
...Perhaps.

**Circe:**
When I first met you, I thought:

**Circe:**
“Maybe, just maybe, he'll take me
away from this island one day.”

**Odysseus:**
...I see.

**Odysseus:**
So from your perspective, Aeaea Island
was both paradise and prison.

**Circe:**
Yup. I was being kind of...half-assed
about living my life back then.

**Circe:**
I didn't go out of my way to be around people, like Medea did.

**Circe:**
But I also couldn't become a goddess and isolate myself from the world, like Hecate.

**Circe:**
I was just a hopeless witch living my life out aimlessly.

**Odysseus:**
...
...

**Circe:**
There's something I need to tell you.

**Odysseus:**
All right.

**Circe:**
...But first, I want to fight you.

**Odysseus:**
...
...

**Circe:**
Not what you were expecting?

**Odysseus:**
No... I wouldn't say that.

**Odysseus:**
In fact, I figured this is what
we were both summoned for.

**Circe:**
You're right.

**Circe:**
We're both imposters through and through&ndash;paper balloons that are destined to disappear.

**Circe:**
But none of that matters now.
What matters now is that I'm here...

**Circe:**
...and I'm going to tell you&ndash;
No, show you how I really feel!

**Circe:**
I'm taking my emotion limiters off.
I'm not gonna hold anything back.

**Odysseus:**
Then show me what you've got!

**Circe:**
The goddess in heaven smiles upon me. The mysterious power of the Titans runs through my veins.

**Circe:**
Their vast wisdom is the wind beneath my wings.
Now behold as I take flight!

**Circe:**
My name is Circe!
I am the queen witch of Okeanos!

**Odysseus:**
Very well, Circe, queen witch of Okeanos.
I accept your challenge.

**Odysseus:**
My name is Odysseus. I am the son and
heir of Laertes, and the king of Ithaca.

**Odysseus:**
I am the ever-versatile hero who triumphed
over an odyssey of epic proportions!

**Odysseus:**
Now come, and let us have a good, clean fight!


**==ARROW==**

**Odysseus:**
I suppose that's that then.

**Circe:**
Master!

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I'm sorry...

---

**Circe:**
No, it's okay. You were just worried about us, right?

**Odysseus:**
There is nothing wrong with that.
It's exactly what a Master is supposed to do.

**Odysseus:**
Besides...it doesn't matter which of us wins.
Isn't that right, Circe?

**Circe:**
...Yeah, that's right.

**Circe:**
Thinking about it now, we should've just done this from the start. Er, back when we were still alive, I mean.

**Circe:**
If I'd hit you as hard as I could, cursed your name, and had a no-holds-barred fight like this with you back then...

**Circe:**
...I could've gotten over you a long time ago, instead of leaving the wound you inflicted on me open forever.

**Circe:**
...So.

**Circe:**
Now I'm gonna tell you how I really feel,
before you disappear.

**Odysseus:**
...All right.

**Circe:**
I used to be in love with you.

**Circe:**
Even if it was completely unrequited,
I loved you all the same!

**Circe:**
...But you'll never feel the same way about me, will you?

**Odysseus:**
...No, I won't.

**Odysseus:**
My heart belongs to Penelope.
That hasn't changed, even now that I'm a Servant.

**Circe:**
Would you at least tell me why you love her?

**Odysseus:**
I... I don't know. It's not because of her beauty,
nor her kindness.

**Odysseus:**
I just...love her for who she is.

**Odysseus:**
I'm sorry I can't explain it better.

**Circe:**
Don't worry, I got it.
Thanks for being straight with me.

**Circe:**
You didn't do anything wrong, Odysseus.
Not a thing.

**Circe:**
I guess I kind of gave Medea the wrong idea...

**Circe:**
...but my only regret about my time
with you was how we parted ways.

**Circe:**
That the very last words we exchanged were angry ones.

**Circe:**
So...I know this is a couple thousand years late,
but I want to say it anyway.

**Narration:**
He and I stand facing each other. Our only company
is the deep red sunset and the sound of the waves.

**Circe:**
Odysseus, I hope your life is full of happiness.

**Circe:**
All I want... All I've ever wanted...
is for you to be happy.

**Odysseus:**
...
...

**Odysseus:**
I'm relieved too.
I'm glad to see you looking so happy yourself.

**Circe:**
That's 'cause I am.

**Circe:**
I've got a great Master, great new friends...
I'm living the hell out of this second lease on life.

**Odysseus:**
I'm glad to hear that.

**Odysseus:**
...Hmm. I guess it's time for me to go.

**Circe:**
Well, take care.
See you at Chaldea someday.

**Odysseus:**
Same to you.

**Odysseus:**
...Oh, and Fujimaru?
Look after Circe for me, would you?

**Odysseus:**
As long as you're around, I'm sure she'll be okay.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
I will. I promise.

---

**Circe:**
There he goes...

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Are you okay?

**Circe:**
Oh yeah. Better than okay.

---

**Fujimaru 2:**
I hope I wasn't a third wheel.

**Circe:**
Of course not.
I'm super grateful you were here, Master.

---

**Circe:**
I'd already made peace with my feelings a long time ago. I just didn't want to accept that.

**Circe:**
But, I'm okay now.

**Circe:**
Sure, he broke my heart...but I got over it! It's a little painful, but I can deal with it no problem!

**Circe:**
Hey, Master?

**Circe:**
I know I'm just one of dozens of Servants to you...

**Circe:**
...but I'm really glad you're my Master.

**Circe:**
...Anyway, on a different topic,
will you lend me your shoulder for a bit?

**Circe:**
'Cause I'm just gonna break down sobbing for a bit.

**Circe:**
...Thank you. I mean it.
Farewell, my love.

**Narration:**
And so, this insignificant little Singularity disappeared without a trace, carrying my regrets away with it.

## Epilogue: You Smile Like a Flower

**Narration:**
...Some time later.

**Medea Lily:**
Oh, hello, Aun&ndash;Lady Circe.

**Circe:**
Good, you remembered.
Excellent work.

**Medea Lily:**
Well, you said you were going
to curse me if I didn't, so...

**Circe:**
You better believe it!

**Medea Lily:**
Anyway, I'm surprised to see you with short hair.

**Circe:**
I just felt like a change of pace...or hairdo, anyway.

**Circe:**
It's not like it made me weaker or anything,
so what's the harm?

**Medea Lily:**
Is this because of Odysseus?

**Circe:**
Hahaha, of course not.
I told you, I just felt like it.

**Medea Lily:**
I see.

**Circe:**
Well, see you later.

**Circe:**
Now that work's all taken care of, I've got a lot of lazing around in Master's room to catch up on.

**Medea Lily:**
Okay, have fun.

**Circe:**
Oh, and one more thing:
don't go creating any more minute Singularities!

**Medea Lily:**
I won't. Especially not after that earful I got from
you and seemingly everyone else in Chaldea...

**Medea Lily:**
Don't worry, I've learned my lesson.

**Circe:**
Good. Still, that being said...
Thanks, Medea!

**Medea Lily:**
...You're welcome!

**Arjuna:**
Oh, Circe.

**Circe:**
Hey, Arjuna. Say, how was the curry
you were looking forward to, anyway?

**Arjuna:**
(Sigh)...

**Arjuna:**
They actually had curry in the cafeteria just now...but it was the especially mild variety they make for children.

**Circe:**
Couldn't you have tossed in some
hot peppers or something?

**Arjuna:**
I plan to, but I'm going to do so in my
room just so I don't get any complaints.

**Circe:**
What about you guys?

**Jason:**
Us? We're taking Arjuna up on
his ultraspicy curry challenge.

**Jason:**
Heh... He may have the upper hand,
but I'm still a Greek hero.

**Jason:**
I certainly can't afford to lose a duel over
something as insignificant as spiciness.

**Orion:**
You said it.

**Orion:**
Besides, it's just spicy food, right? So I figure the worst that could happen is my tongue burns for a while.

**Arjuna:**
Would you care to join us, Circe?

**Circe:**
Nah, I'll pass, thanks.

**Circe:**
Besides, I can already tell you
two are gonna lose miserably.

**Jason & Orion:**
That's what you think!

**Circe:**
Where the hell do you guys get
all your confidence from!?

**Orion:**
Hm? Hey, I just realized there's something
different about you. Is it the hair?

**Circe:**
Crap. Guess I should've known you'd notice, Orion.

**Orion:**
I'm guessing by that initial “crap” reaction
that you don't mean that as a compliment.

**Jason:**
...Ohhh, I get it!
It's because you had your heart bro&ndash;

**Circe:**
Ugh, get with the times already, Jason.
What do you think this is, the B.C. era?

**Jason:**
What was that!?

**Circe:**
Well, if you ever feel like joining us in modern times, you could do worse than taking a page from the Red Archer in the cafeteria's playbook.

**Circe:**
Anyway, I'm gonna bounce. Byyye.

**Jason:**
She's been in a weirdly good mood ever
since we took care of that Singularity...

**Orion:**
It kind of feels like she's more...
comfortable with herself now?

**Arjuna:**
...
...

**Orion:**
Arjuna?

**Arjuna:**
I see. In some cultures, people cut their
hair after they've suffered a broken heart.

**Arjuna:**
TIL, as they say nowadays.

**Jason:**
You're still hung up on that!?

**Georgios:**
Oh, hello, Circe.

**Circe:**
What's up, Georgios?
Out taking pictures again?

**Georgios:**
Yes, I am.
...Say, would you mind if I took one of you?

**Circe:**
Me? Sure, if you want.

**Georgios:**
All right, here goes...

**Georgios:**
Thank you.

**Circe:**
So why'd you want my photo all of a sudden?

**Georgios:**
Good question.

**Georgios:**
If I had to give a reason, I suppose I'd say that you looked so sublimely happy...

**Georgios:**
It reminded me of a beautiful flower
basking in the sunlight.

**Circe:**
Aww, thanks.
It's always nice being compared to a flower.

**Georgios:**
By the way, I'm exhibiting the photos I took at the last Singularity in the cafeteria if you'd like to see them.

**Circe:**
Ooh, nice. I'll have to check those out.

**Georgios:**
Anyway, I'd better be on my way.

**Georgios:**
Oh, but first, there's something I need to tell you.
You-know-who was just summoned here.

**Circe:**
Oho!

**Odysseus:**
...Hmm.

**Circe:**
You already showed up, huh?
That was faster than I thought.

**Odysseus:**
Circe... Is that you, Circe?

**Circe:**
It sure is!
I see you finally got summoned here too, Odysseus.

**Odysseus:**
Indeed. It's good to see you.

**Circe:**
Same. So hey, if you ever have any questions about things here, feel free to ask. I know my way around this place pretty well by now.

**Odysseus:**
...?

**Circe:**
Something wrong?

**Odysseus:**
No. I was just surprised how you seem
a little...different now than when you were alive.

**Circe:**
That's part of being a Servant. We've got a second lease on life, so we might as well make the most of it.

**Odysseus:**
...Is that so?

**Circe:**
Sure is.
Oh, right, I almost forgot.

**Odysseus:**
Hm?

**Circe:**
Since we're going to be fighting under the same Master from now on, I figure we should at least shake hands.

**Odysseus:**
Good point.

**Circe:**
Well, see you around!

**Odysseus:**
Circe!

**Circe:**
Hm?

**Odysseus:**
...No, never mind. It's nothing.
I look forward to fighting by your side.

**Circe:**
As well you should.
I'm not the queen witch for nothing, you know!

**Odysseus:**
...
...A second lease on life, huh.

---

**Fujimaru 1:**
Come in!

---

**Circe:**
Hey there, Piglet!? How are you doing?

**Circe:**
It's me!
Your beloved Servant, Circe the queen witch!

**Narration:**
It was nice to meet you, my love.
Now, it's time to say goodbye.

**Narration:**
I pray.

**Narration:**
I pray for his happiness... My happiness...
And Master's happiness.

**Narration:**
I hope.

**Narration:**
I hope that he'll like it here in Chaldea,
and that he'll find somewhere he belongs.

**Narration:**
I wish.

**Narration:**
I wish that my love, wilted as it may be now,
might one day bloom again.

**Narration:**
By doing so, I've come to love myself as I am,
even if only a little.

**Narration:**
I do have wings, and so am always
ready to take to the sky...
