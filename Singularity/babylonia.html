Prelude</h2><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Morning, Mash. I have something personal to discuss with you today.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This morning, the Doctor came to me like any other day.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> His voice, his breath, his mannerisms. He was the same calm, peaceful man he always was.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> As your primary physician, I need to have a serious discussion with you. I&#39;m going to grit my teeth and tell you the truth here.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Mash Kyrielight, your lifespan is nearing its limit.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Just like humanity has no future past 2019, you have no future beyond that time.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> This was decided at the beginning. You can&#39;t stop it, I can&#39;t stop it. No one can stop it.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Even the Grail, the supposedly omnipotent wish granter, cannot change this fate.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> After all, the Grail is merely a shadow that fell just one step lower from a higher dimensional phase. A great crystallized magical resource.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Calling it an omnipotent wish granter is like saying you can buy anything with money.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> The truth is, the Grail can only execute what a human envisions. It is not omnipotent. Don&#39;t be mistaken about that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I silently agreed. The Grail is only a means of accelerating things.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Raising buildings. Building cities. Making epochs.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For everything humans have done, the Grail uses its vast stores of magical energy to make the process quicker.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why was the Doctor telling me something that I already knew?</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to die soon. It has nothing to do with your own will. It&#39;s simply how you were created.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Do you find that frustrating? Or sad? Does it make you feel empty?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, I—</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> It&#39;s terrible. I&#39;m not talking about Chaldea&#39;s research. I&#39;m talking about all of humanity, and all of life.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Living things are destined to die from the moment they&#39;re born. And yet, they possess the capacity to grow.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> If something&#39;s going to die, why bother growing? Both the physical body and the spirit should maintain the same state from birth till death.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> If they did, there would be no sadness or pain. Everything would be equal. Everything would have meaning from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> But this planet&#39;s life is nothing but waste. It&#39;s essentially growing just so that it can die.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> It&#39;s meaningless. Truly meaningless. The more time passes, the more life leaves this world unfulfilled.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help but think that, when it comes to the life-forms on this world, the planet simply has the wrong settings.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think so, Mash? You are half-manmade.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> You are an incomplete being, a product made by imperfect humans who tried to play God.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> You have the right to hate them, and the duty to reject them. Human history has no value.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> All this is no more than the remnants left behind by humans leading meaningless lives.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> It just so happens to look like a picture that has meaning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What was strange was how gentle his words were.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everything he said was impossible for me to accept. I couldn&#39;t agree at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But his voice was so gentle. His words were filled with wisdom and compassion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> “If it&#39;s causing you pain, you can stop. ” He whispered into my ear with a voice both sweet and dangerous.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re not Dr. Roman, are you?</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Dr. Roman can be pessimistic, anti-social, and he often says the wrong thing and gives up...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But he would never deny any kind of human effort. You only look like him. You&#39;re something else entirely.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> ...Ha.</p><p><strong>Romani Archaman:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...6: 00 AM...This is when I always wake up—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What a strange dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It felt like I was being dragged down. As if I took one wrong step, I would never wake from the dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai went through the same thing before. But why would it happen to me now...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The call from the Command Room made me feel tense. Perhaps the strange dream had affected me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I had a feeling that this was a premonition. One that was telling me that my Rayshift into the Seventh Singularity will be my last.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You got here five minutes after the summons. Looks like you&#39;re ready to go, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Given how abrupt the summons was and how early in the morning it is, I suppose there&#39;s no need for explanation...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The day has finally come.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Command Room staff seem more excited than usual.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. The day&#39;s finally here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> According to Chaldea&#39;s clocks, there&#39;s not much of 2018 left. The lost year of 2019 is almost upon us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Before that happens, we need to find out what caused the Incineration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That is the purpose of our Grand Order. And our long journey is almost at an end.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Master Fujimaru, we owe it all to you and Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m two minutes late! Mash Kyrielight has arrived!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Morning, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...Hello. Good morning, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sorry for being so flustered. I need to stay calm at all times, don&#39;t I?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You look a little tense, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> D-do I? I&#39;m sorry, I washed my face with three times as much cold water as usual, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess it wasn&#39;t enough...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But hearing your voice made me feel better. The first thing I need to say is “Good morning,” right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, yes. Good to see you&#39;re getting along. A tough spirit is one thing, but teamwork is important too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right. Fujimaru, Mash, let&#39;s try this again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At seven o&#39;clock this morning, Chaldea completed its preparations for the seventh Singularity Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve little time left. Our backs are against the wall here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The last Singularity...This is the Grail that Solomon sent into the past himself, and I&#39;d like you to recover it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know I sound like a broken record, but are you ready? It&#39;s going to be another tough journey.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to us. We&#39;ll do our best.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course. We&#39;ll bring back souvenirs.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. That&#39;s the kind of person you are, Fujimaru. I was silly to even ask.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s start the briefing. This time, we will Rayshift to the beginning of human history–</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The beginning of all civilization, the world when it was unified as one.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The mother that flourished along the Tigris and Euphrates and influenced a great many civilizations.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> One of the world&#39;s oldest civilizations, which began almost simultaneously with the earliest Egyptian kingdoms.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In the world of magecraft, this era was the twilight of the Age of Gods and a topic of research.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The land of ancient Mesopotamia, 2600 B. C. The beginning of Sumerian civilization after the Ubaid culture.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The world of the B. C. era...Where reality was a place of mystery, and gods walked the land...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Indeed! Mesopotamia, in the age of the first Sumerian kings!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just the process of getting there makes this tougher than any previous Singularity!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s the last age of fantasy on Earth, when gods and monsters were a part of everyday life!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The great Da Vinci is here!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, I&#39;m here! Thank you for another great reaction!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It was worth waiting for the right moment to come out.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I mean, genius is measured by how much surprise one can generate. So Fujimaru, come find me later, I&#39;ll give you some embers.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Jeez...If you were waiting for the right moment, I&#39;d have preferred you&#39;d just shown up from the beginning.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good morning, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Humph. What kind of response is that? How boring! All my effort waiting to burst out at the right moment has gone up in smoke!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t say that. You surprised me. To think one person has the power to silence the entire room in an instant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...The way you put so much effort into such trivial matters...I wish Senpai could be like that sometimes.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Leonardo, quit messing around. Do you have what I asked you for?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s done. Of course it would be.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru, here&#39;s a present for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this...a scarf? It seems to be made from very fine and sturdy fibers...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Remember the mask I made to protect you in the desert? Say hello to Mark II!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The mana density in the atmosphere is much greater than what you experienced in ancient Egypt.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s a limit to what you can take with you on a Rayshift. This is the bare minimum, but I promise you it&#39;s effective.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, by the way, I&#39;ll be in the Command Room this time as well. Don&#39;t worry about proving your existence in that era.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it my birthday today?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be silly. I&#39;d get you something much fancier than this for your birthday.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However, that&#39;s an excellent response. Wit and humor can be powerful weapons for humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right. I suppose I shall give you a small lecture on the place you&#39;re about to visit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The word “Mesopotamia” is Greek in origin. “Meso” means middle, and “potamia” means river.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It refers to the civilization that flourished between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that flowed into the Persian Gulf.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Order name is Babylonia, but it wasn&#39;t called that until a little later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ancient Mesopotamia...Sumer...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What&#39;s classified as ancient civilization does seem to span over a long period of time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For instance, between 5000 B. C. and 2000 B. C. , many different civilizations flourished and they all played important roles in human history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Indeed. This time we&#39;re sending you to one of those civilizations in 2600 B. C. , the age of the first kings.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> From the point of view of magecraft, it&#39;s the era when humans parted ways with the gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I don&#39;t know the reason the king of this era made that decision...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...but it was at this point that the Age of Gods came to an end, and by the advent of the Anno Domini era, all Divine Spirits had disappeared from the Earth.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Some may have lasted into the A. D. era in some island countries, but by 1000 A. D. they were gone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Except for extreme cases, like deities that remained completely isolated from humans.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s put that topic aside. What I really wanted to talk to you about was the difficulty of this Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Rayshifting into the B. C. era is extremely difficult.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The further back into human history you go, the more unstable the Rayshift. So, as you get closer to the Age of Gods, things get more uncertain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Some academics call the Age of Gods an age of uncertainty. It&#39;s not something that lends itself to observation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> On top of that, Sheba is refusing to stabilize. Actually, I doubt it ever will.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. But with the help of the staff at Chaldea, we were able to calculate the location of the Seventh Singularity and observe it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Given the difficulty, I&#39;ll be staying here in the Command Room. Which also means I won&#39;t be able to act as navigator, but still...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> On my honor as a genius, I hereby swear that I will flawlessly prove your existence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Soooooo, don&#39;t worry about a thing! Get out there and go have a grand adventure!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Leonardo&#39;s statements are inappropriate, but this really is an experience not many can have.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to the ancient world, a place that modern man will never know about.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The danger is immeasurable, but I hope that&#39;s also how amazing your discoveries will be.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Today, on The History Channel Presents...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll do it for you too, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. Once we put an end to everything, tell me what you&#39;ve learned on this journey.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey there. Don&#39;t get so sentimental.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Fujimaru is about to go to battle. You need to keep them sharp.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sheesh...Romani, go and get some sleep. Trying to act tough just proves you&#39;re tired.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I beg your pardon. I got plenty of rest. I&#39;m all fired up and ready to go!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Come. Your Coffins are ready. From here on, this will be your battle, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Sixth Singularity was full of special conditions we never came across before. This one&#39;s going to be every bit as tough.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a unique era, after all. Stay calm, and be ready to deal with anything.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A tense heart will shatter from a blow. Being flexible and adaptable will get you further.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right. See you soon, Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a good example right in front of me.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm? What&#39;s wrong, Mash? I figured you&#39;d be all set to go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m ready to do whatever I must to support Master&#39;s investigation and operations in the Seventh Singularity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...But, I&#39;m sorry, Doctor. Can I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What is it? I hope it&#39;s something I can answer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. This is kind of a philosophical question...but do humans...rather, does life have any meaning at all?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean objectively, not subjectively. I&#39;ve never thought about it, but it&#39;s really bothering me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm...That&#39;s a tough question.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Objective meaning, huh? I mean, if you look at things from a god&#39;s perspective, life might all seem equally meaningless.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well...Really, life has neither meaning, nor merit, right up to the end.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The end?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. If you&#39;re asking about the meaning of it all, well, there isn&#39;t any.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nothing has meaning on its own. Meaning is something that gets determined later.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Humans are born, grow up, and die all without meaning.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s only when a life&#39;s over that you finally see what it meant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s what life is, Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We don&#39;t live in order to create meaning. We live so meaning can be found from our life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. That&#39;s how I&#39;d like to live my life, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, Dr. Roman. I&#39;m grateful for all the kindness you&#39;ve shown me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, you&#39;re both in your Coffins, yeah?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, your mission this time is to recover the Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s important to find and remove the cause of the Singularity, but your biggest goal is to recover the Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We don&#39;t know its exact coordinates. But it should be somewhere in Mesopotamia, your Rayshift destination.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I pray that this is our last search for the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right! I&#39;m starting the Rayshift program!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Everyone here on Chaldea&#39;s staff will do their very best to send Master Fujimaru to the B. C. era!</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> Unsummon Program, start. Spiritron Conversion, start.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> All procedures cleared. Seventh Grand Order, commencing operation.</p><h2 id="section-1-in-the-age-of-the-gods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-in-the-age-of-the-gods" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: In the Age of the Gods</h2><p><strong>Sumerian:</strong><br> Ohhh...Please, please have mercy...! O Mother Goddess, Mother of Demonic Beasts, the one who reigns supreme!</p><p><strong>Sumerian:</strong><br> We do not defy you...! The remaining cities, people, wealth, everything is yours—</p><p><strong>Sumerian:</strong><br> Eeeeeek! D-don&#39;t eat me! Please, don&#39;t eat meeeeee...!</p><p><strong>Sumerian:</strong><br> Kazallu is different than Uruk! We have no intention of following that foolish king!</p><p><strong>Sumerian:</strong><br> W-we will sacrifice everyone up to our second-class citizens! You can have them all! Treat them like livestock I don&#39;t care!</p><p><strong>Sumerian:</strong><br> So please, leave us...Leave us alone, ah! Eeeeeeyaaaaaaggghh...!!!</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Lowly creatures. I am utterly disgusted with you. We have said before that not a single human shall survive.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Even monkeys are smarter than these humans. Do they really think they&#39;re worthy as food? At best, they are fit to fertilize the land.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> That&#39;s still no reason to crush them to death with that serpent body of yours. After all, we&#39;re in our assembly hall.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it good manners to dispose of the prey you capture in your own lair?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> What, you don&#39;t like snakes? I thought you would enjoy playing with them like that.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Weeell...I&#39;m really more for beating my enemies to a pulp in a hand-to-hand brawl, yes! Buuut...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Gracias, pero noooooo! The weight class difference bothers meeeeee! Your way of killing is too sloppyyyyyy!</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> I thought I was handling them with care. Humans are just too fragile.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Eshnunna, Sippar, Kish, and Kazallu. I have swallowed up most of the northern cities.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> It is only a matter of time before Nippur falls. It won&#39;t even take a month to break through that damned Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Well, well. Your ego sure is as big as your body. After working on it for half a year, you still need another month?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> You used enough Demonic Beasts to fill the land, yet you only managed to neutralize the north?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Will you really be able to crush that front in another month? You don&#39;t need our help?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> I do not. We have sworn not to interfere with each other. I do not require your help. In the first place...</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> I find massacring humans all at once to be quite wasteful.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Thus, I have ordered the Demonic Beasts to do whatever they desire to the humans they capture.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> They may drag them to their den and slowly kill them. Or they may eat them alive.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Or perhaps the humans can be used as raw materials for my temple.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...Raw materials for your temple? No wonder it smells even worse than the last time I came here.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> The stench is so strong, it makes me nauseous. A pity, since death is so very pure.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it the same with you? Wasn&#39;t death an everyday thing in your mythos?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Exaaactly! Keeping the beaten alive for later is unthiiinkable!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> That being said, this is the result of the survival of the fittest. I won&#39;t condemn her principles.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...After all, I&#39;d do the same thing. In the end, I meticulously snuff them out, one by one.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that what this is? That&#39;s why we were summoned.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> The goddess who slays this era&#39;s king and obtains the Holy Grail will become the ruler of this world.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> That&#39;s what we, the Three Goddess Alliance, swore, right?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Or, what? Have you changed your mind? Do you feel pity for slaughtering humans, as foolish as they are?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> As you&#39;re the one and only legitimate surviving Sumerian goddess of this era, are you losing your taste for slaughter?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...Nonsense. This is exactly what I want.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Uruk has been my land from the very beginning. I just let the humans borrow it on a whim.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I feel neither mercy nor obligation. As a pillar for the Three Goddess Alliance, I will erase humans from the face of this land.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Heh...Abandoned even by a native goddess. The humans of this era truly are inferior wretches not worth saving.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Good. It sounds like your wills are unwavering. Mother will be relieved to know that the alliance&#39;s oath is eternal.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> ...Is that you? When did you return? How many times must I tell you to go to Mother when you&#39;ve returned?</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> As you can see, I&#39;m hurrying over to you now.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Mother, you should refrain from associating with these two goddesses on your own.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> They are dependable allies, but fearsome competitors at the same time.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> More importantly, they&#39;re the only beings on Earth that possess the Authority necessary to kill you, Mother.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> It&#39;s entirely possible they joined forces with you because they want the Holy Grail and are planning to betray you.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> They wouldn&#39;t do that. The alliance of goddesses is not so fickle.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> An attack upon another goddess will turn into divine punishment that rebounds upon the attacker. She who raises her hand would be destroyed.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Therefore the only attack we have is to obtain the Holy Grail before the others.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> That is the game we play.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Yes. The king of Uruk has the Holy Grail hidden somewhere. The goddess who obtains it will rule the post-human world.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> The Grail was sent to this land— It&#39;s the one contract that the Mage King established.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> However, the method of obtaining the objective wasn&#39;t laid out. Therefore, everyone is free to search for the Holy Grail however they like.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> For example—Mother&#39;s method is to seek the Grail within the ashes of Uruk after eradicating the humans.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> And your method, which seems to be decimating Uruk with nature itself combined with your own physical prowess.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> Or, finally, yours, which could be as simple as waving a hand and wiping out all life in an instant, before anyone knew what happened.</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> All of these are little more than your own pathways to acquiring the Holy Grail itself. Still...Be careful...</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> I sensed a strange fluctuation...That final ray of hope for humanity&#39;s future prophesied by Uruk&#39;s astrologer...</p><p><strong>E：Boy&#39;s Voice:</strong><br> The last mage, who may yet protect humanity, has arrived in our era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Aaaaaaaaahhhh!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooooouuuuu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoooooooaaaaa!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re falling! Where&#39;s the parachute!? I estimate that we&#39;re currently at an altitude of 200 meters!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Seven seconds until impact! M-M-M-Master, your orders! What should I do!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Calm down and brace for impact!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, I&#39;m counting on you...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Mash Kyrielight will do her utmost! Master, give me your hand...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, caught you! Now just grab onto my waist and hold tight please!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foooouuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Noble Phantasm, deploy...! Galahad, grant me your power...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai...I mean, Master. Are you hurt...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll live.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Thank you. Nice save, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m the one who needs to thank you. It happened so suddenly that my mind went blank—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Blank.... Um, you&#39;re still clinging to me, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou fou fouuuu. Fou, fouuu!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah...Fou, you took cover in my shield? Thank goodness you&#39;re safe, too.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, can you stand?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad. The landing wasn&#39;t perfect, but it seems the Rayshift was successful.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fou...You really are smart!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Mumf, fouuuu fou, fouuuu...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Are both of you all right!? Safe and sound!? Whew! For a second there, I didn&#39;t know what would happen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We had a 200-meter free fall when we Rayshifted, but Master&#39;s quick thinking saved us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There have been many accidents up until now, but I never thought we&#39;d end up in midair after a Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, what happened?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Apparently the Rayshift was intentionally tampered with.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We successfully set it to the biggest city of that era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But immediately after the Rayshift was established, it seems all of you were forcibly shot to that location.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Do you think it could be interference from the King of Mages?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hmm. That&#39;s probably not it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. I agree with Fujimaru. My guess is that some power in the city repelled you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not even Solomon is almighty. He can&#39;t be on guard against us when we can appear anytime, anywhere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe this is that city.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> City? Wait, did you end up somewhere in the city? I do see multiple life signals, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, sorry for interrupting☆ Roman, I got an answer for you. What they experienced was a forced deportation caused by a barrier.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There seems to be a Bounded Field around the city of Uruk. Probably to ward off attacks.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So we bounced off of the city&#39;s defense mechanism. It&#39;s true that we are trespassers, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yeah. The question is, why is an ominous field like that set up?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Like all of the Singularities up until now, there is impending danger in the city of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash. First reassess the situation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re calculating coordinates over here, but the precision is still low. Actually, there&#39;s too much information!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Blame it on the ancient world. The mana concentration is so thick that our information processing can&#39;t keep up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Under these circumstances, visual footage from Fujimaru will give us clues to analyze.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, does anything stick out? What about that band of light in the sky?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah...That&#39;s right. We&#39;ll continue monitoring the situation. The band of light...Yes, it&#39;s still there.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. So there&#39;s one in that era, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In that case, there must be a place where the Incineration of Humanity was carried out...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Do you notice anything else? What kind of place you&#39;re in?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For lack of a better word...Ruins.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ruins as far as the eye can see.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. Ruins, huh? I mean, I could kind of tell from the video feed, but...(Sigh)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty far away from Uruk. I was thinking you should gather food before heading there, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That won&#39;t be possible, unfortunately. There&#39;s nothing but ruins here. Both food and information gathering are out of the question.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I thought so. The only silver lining is that Da Vinci&#39;s scarf is working well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> According to the data we&#39;re getting, the concentration of mana in the air is higher than in Egypt.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, how are you, physically? Do you have a headache or ringing in your ears?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m perfectly fine.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> See, what did I tell you? My work is perfect. You owe me some Japanese sweets from your stash, Romani!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t hear ringing...but I can hear crying.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> An abnormality in your tympanum? No, the fact that you can hear crying means—</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please wait, Doctor! I thought I heard a faint rumbling from the ground—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up odd magical energy heading our way! Are you getting it on the monitor!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Confirmed! It&#39;s a hostile! It took a long time to confirm because it&#39;s a pattern we haven&#39;t seen before!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The staff apologizes, too! Uh, but that can wait till later! The enemy&#39;s coming!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> 2600 B. C. , ancient Sumeria—Your first battle in the in the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But you have nothing to fear. After all, you haven&#39;t lost yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Show this era the power of the Master and Servant who overcame six Singularities!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger! Let&#39;s go, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well said, Doctor! Time to do this!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The battle is over. We&#39;ve only sustained minor injuries. However—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was an enemy type we&#39;ve never seen before.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m not sure how to describe it, but...It looked to be from a completely different ecosystem...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Unlike werebeasts, dragons, and other creatures that eventually disappeared from the world at the end of the Age of Gods...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But those Demonic Beasts...I don&#39;t think they were of this world at all.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Not of this world, huh...Perhaps they differed from the garden variety Demonic Beasts that existed in the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We were prepared. We had data on of all the Phantasmals and Demonic Beasts from the Sumerian era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But none of it matches what you&#39;ve just encountered...What is going on...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s not the worst of it: those Demonic Beasts were clearly trying to kill us.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t mere hostility. Their intention was to kill.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All of the Demonic Beasts we&#39;ve encountered thus far have attacked us out of bestial instinct, to feed themselves...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Demonic Beasts just now, though, they attacked solely to kill us. I could feel the hatred in their eyes...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hatred...Demonic Beasts that harbor hatred toward humans...Are you saying they&#39;re trying to annihilate us, not eat us?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...If so, you&#39;re in danger. Fujimaru, leave that city immediately.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, what?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Are you saying the reason the city is in ruins is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, that possibility is high. That&#39;s why you should leave immediately.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree with the Doctor, Master. Animals act in packs.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> OUTTA MY WAAAAAAY!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the last of the Demonic Beasts—Oh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hey you! You&#39;re IN THE WAY! I can&#39;t use my decrees with you there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Senpai. Did you hear something? It sounded like a voice...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, I did. But I guess...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s no use. We can&#39;t avoid this.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? ...Um...Wait, wait, wait!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> How am I supposed to brake in time if the air brakes don&#39;t work! Oh no, I&#39;m going to hit them!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If Father finds out, he&#39;ll take my license away for sure! But let me say this first: I&#39;m NOT in the wrong!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, are you all right!? Something beige, coming in at a 45-degree angle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...has just fallen from the sky.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...Fou, fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ouch...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Owww...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ouch...What a disaster...I didn&#39;t think I would be sniped from the ground...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Luckily the damage wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought it would be. I guess I have my usual benevolent (read: violent) deeds to thank for that.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hey there. I&#39;m your cushion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll see you in court!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Wait, what are youuuuuu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on over there!? Fujimaru&#39;s vitals are all red!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, a woman fell from the sky...Oh, the mysterious woman separated herself from Senpai.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This era has way too many crash landings! Still, it&#39;s good we&#39;ve met a native. Now we can get info—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa! Whoa whoa whoaaaaaa! These numbers...Is this for real!? Is this some kind of mistake!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s that? Some kind of Mystic that lets you see from afar? Also, it has a reeeally annoying voice!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But that doesn&#39;t matter for now. Let&#39;s talk about this wretched fool&#39;s punishment for touching my body without my permission.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Your face and outfit are unfamiliar. What city are you from? I didn&#39;t think there were still humans around.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Are you a sacrifice fleeing from Nippur? Or a survivor from Babylon?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Whichever it is, give yourself up. After I shoot your limbs off, I&#39;ll scatter you over Mt. Ebih.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Master, this woman is ready for battle! I can sense her genuine animosity towards you! )</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I see. I&#39;ll take your silence as confirmation of my assumption. Good, I don&#39;t have to show you any mercy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you were from Uruk, I&#39;d have shown some mercy. Curse your bad luck.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait. Let&#39;s calm down and talk about this.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What are you talking about? How dare a mere human speak to me like that!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Talk it out? ...With me? Why would I do that? You&#39;re not even from the Sacred Temple.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hold it. We need to settle this accident first.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Settle...You mean a trial? Th-the answer is no. I&#39;m not falling for that!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No matter how minor the collision, the one in the vehicle is at a disadvantage! I know that!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please hold on...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The collision was an unforeseen accident, and it seems neither side was responsible!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So can we please have a word with you? Um, well...Miss...who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We need a name first.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Are you guys seriously saying you don&#39;t know who I am?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Well...sorry. It hasn&#39;t even been an hour since we arrived in this era...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We are members of a group called Chaldea. We were sent here to this Singularity to correct the course of humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t know what we&#39;re talking about, but we&#39;re not suspicious...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually, Senpai&#39;s hands looked plenty suspicious, so something ought to be said about that, but...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So, you&#39;re guests from afar? That&#39;s hard to believe...But, I suppose stuff like that happens.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You might say I&#39;m here in a similar manner. Fine. I will believe your words.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> In other words, you have no idea who I am. You don&#39;t know about this world, or what&#39;s happening here.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I see. Then your disrespect, insolence, and impoliteness can&#39;t be helped. You&#39;re barbarians from a distant world, after all.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Look, touching me without permission is completely unforgivable in this world.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Any Sumerian would immediately apologize, but wouldn&#39;t be forgiven even after offering their whole family&#39;s life savings.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Keep that in mind from now on. Assuming you want to survive in this world, that is.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And thanks for being my cushion. You were at least as helpful as a pile of hay.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s not a very nice way to say thanks...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At least she seems to have calmed down, so why don&#39;t we re-introduce ourselves?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m Romani Archaman. I&#39;m the acting commander of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This [♂ boy /♀ girl] is Fujimaru, a Master who&#39;s formed contracts with Heroic Spirits and commands them as Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And, this girl is one of those Servants, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re done introducing ourselves.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, who are you? Based on my readings, you&#39;re probably a—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You&#39;re not worthy to hear my name. Just forget about me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Especially you over there. Fujimaru, was it?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Forget everything that happened earlier. If you do, I&#39;ll at least spare your life.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What thing earlier?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So many things have happened, so...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Like! I! Was! Saying! If any of this gets out, like how I mishandled the Boat of Heaven, or how I screamed, or about my current body size...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll chase you to the ends of the earth!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (This is not good, Senpai. She doesn&#39;t seem to want to kill you anymore, but I can still sense her hostility. )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (In my personal opinion, gaining any information from her will be quite a difficult task...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seems that way...One bad move and we&#39;re dead.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, you understand. Wonderful. It&#39;s a good thing to be humble.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I won&#39;t treat you with disdain with that attitude, so revere me...Like, three times a day.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You think so? She looks like a softy...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I heard that! Who are you calling a softy!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Humph. Fine. There&#39;s no point being mad at barbarians.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You wanted to know about this era, you said. Go figure those things out with your own eyes and ears.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I won&#39;t tell you anything. Actually, you tell me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Right...For example, did you see anything precious lying around here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Like I said, something precious. Was anything on the ground?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Like, something that makes you think, “Wooow! ”at first glance.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> It&#39;s something you&#39;d know the moment you saw it, so I won&#39;t bother to explain. So how about it? Anything ring a bell?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, um...Even if you put it like that. Judging from the context, did you drop something?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Idiot, of course not! I didn&#39;t drop anything at all!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m just asking for a friend! I don&#39;t care about that thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is...terrible...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah...I can tell that across a screen, too...Stay patient in dealing with her, Fujimaru...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you think it&#39;d help if you told us what it was?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I won&#39;t! If I told you what I dropped, you&#39;d find out about my clumsiness!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooou...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Anyway, you just need to tell me if “something” was “around here” or not!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...So? Was it?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, and was it broken? Did it break? Did I do it again?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you say anything!? Staying silent is sooo cruel!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Nosssssssss!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Nosss? North? You&#39;re telling me it&#39;s to the north? Is that it!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it. That voice wasn&#39;t Senpai&#39;s! This is—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, I looked away for a second since she seemed like a hassle! Numerous heat signatures approaching from the north!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They look like reinforcements for the previous Demonic Beasts! You two, get ready!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right...! Master, your orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay! Miss Unknown, stand back!</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Hmph. You&#39;re pretty quick to change gears. However, you still lack the observational skills of a good mage.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Stand back because it&#39;s dangerous? Who do you think you&#39;re speaking to, you country hick!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> YOU are the one who should stand back. I&#39;m really getting pissed off—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take all my frustration out on them, and I&#39;ll do it with a bang!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s that. I may have only pseudo-manifested, but I&#39;m not going to lose to Tiamat&#39;s Demonic Beasts!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow! You&#39;re strong!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going to get anything from me by stating the obvious. But I will repay you later if I can.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow! Flashy!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I know, right? No matter what form I may be in, I&#39;m always the best!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sorry to interrupt your conversation! Second and third waves are coming!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, please give us data on the area! Just how many Demonic Beasts are there?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Way too many! I&#39;m seeing 60 right now, with more coming! This town has become their den!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s nowhere to run! You&#39;re completely surrounded!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going to get out of this unless you can fly...Fujimaru, negotiate with that woman over there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She must be able to fly! Ask her to take you two out of—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Don&#39;t make decisions on your own! Weren&#39;t you listening to me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This boat only holds one. To take those two, they would basically have to cling onto me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But didn&#39;t I tell you? In this world, touching me is a sin punishable by death.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I only fought because I wanted to. I didn&#39;t fight for you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Master...Fujimaru, was it?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you&#39;re struggling against these Demonic Beasts, then repairing the course of Humanity is but a dream for you.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You should quietly return to this Chaldea place. And if you can&#39;t do that...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Well, why don&#39;t you just die? I have no intention of helping the weak.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Miss Unknown has taken off! She has left the battlefield at an incredible speed!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I guess we&#39;re not going to get her help! It was worth a shot, though!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do you know something?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ll talk later. Now just think about getting out of there! Focus your attacks on a single point!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, head east with Mash! There are fewer Demonic Beasts in that area!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that. We&#39;ll head for the castle ruins visible to the east! We&#39;re going to punch through this, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>C：Demonic Beast:</strong><br> Fushaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh! The enemy reinforcements are endless! Without any Anti-Army Noble Phantasms, the enemies—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You want numbers? That&#39;s good. Looks like I&#39;ll be able to help.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You, Demi-Servant. And you, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Could you step back a bit? Yes, that&#39;s good. Now, all I have to do...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...is wipe the lot of them out all at once. Since there are only 100 or so of them, I won&#39;t have to wipe out the entire town.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> If you&#39;re the Master of Chaldea, I&#39;m sure you have your own Anti-Army Noble Phantasms, but you can use them next time.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> This city may be in ruins, but humans once lived here. It&#39;d be best to preserve it as long as possible, right?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Sorry for stealing the show. But it&#39;s best to keep the collateral damage to a minimum.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> I know this place is a ruin now, but people may want to come back one day, you know?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re—</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It&#39;s an honor to meet you, Master of Chaldea. My name is Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I have waited in this Age of Gods for humans like you to arrive. I was given the task of connecting mankind with this world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enkidu? Did you just say Enkidu!? Then you&#39;re the best help we could ever hope for!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s no individual stronger from that era, comparable even to that king! Fujimaru, you can trust this person!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Work together and get out of this predicament!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, this is not...a person. Nor a Servant either...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> More like a machine than anything, and yet like a human with a soul...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. As a Demi-Servant, you&#39;re able to figure out my true nature.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You must have sensed and categorized me as a foreign element created by the gods.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I apologize for frightening you. I should have waited longer before meeting you.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But now is the time for battle. I cannot let you fall prey to those Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Please forgive me for being so callous. Would you allow me to fight by your side?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, of course! I apologize for being insensitive myself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, your orders! Enkidu and I will defeat the enemy!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That poison dragon, Bašmu, was the last one. In any event, we have exterminated all the Demonic Beasts in this town.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But we are not safe yet. The scent of the blood of the fallen will draw more here.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This land has become a den for Demonic Beasts. Their number is likely to increase, not decrease.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I believe I have introduced myself. That invisible mage should know more details about me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. I apologize. Your display of power left me speechless!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m assuming you are the real Enkidu, correct? Not a Servant, but an actual living being?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which means you&#39;re a native here. Yet you possess such power...No wonder you are called the Weapon of the Gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They were not lying when they said you&#39;re the world&#39;s strongest Noble Phantasm with a living will. It&#39;s even said you were on par with King Gilgamesh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Weapon of the Gods?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Noble Phantasm with a living will?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Enkidu is found in the world&#39;s oldest heroic tale, the Epic of Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Gilgamesh was a king that didn&#39;t listen to the gods; he was an individual with incredible power that lived in the moment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In order to admonish King Gilgamesh, the gods sculpted a doll from mud.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The doll had a soul like humans, and could change its shape at will. At times it became a Noble Phantasm capable of piercing enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The world&#39;s strongest god-made human, into which the gods poured all their energy. That&#39;s what Enkidu is.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s absolutely right! Mesopotamian civilization used mud to make any number of things.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And you can call Enkidu its greatest masterpiece!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Soft enough to change forms, yet sharp as the keenest blade! The manifestation of nature itself, able to bind and kill Divine Beasts.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If King Gilgamesh, a mix of human and divine blood, is the Wedge of the Heavens created by the gods,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enkidu is the Chain of the Heavens created to return Gilgamesh to the gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinci is sulking saying, “I can do something like that too. ” But I&#39;d say she&#39;s just putting up a front.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In any event, nothing&#39;s more encouraging than to have Enkidu on humanity&#39;s side!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not even the tyrannical King Gilgamesh could destroy this good-hearted hero!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Umm. It is quite embarrassing to be complimented this much.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I am nothing more than a weapon created by the gods. How a weapon is used is up to its handler.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If I appear to have a good heart, then it is because the human who used me was good and lawful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re a...weapon? Yet you seem to have a heart...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes, I do have a heart. I don&#39;t have feelings though, or I didn&#39;t at first.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The only thing I possessed was knowledge of being a weapon: what I needed to destroy, and when I needed to act.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But there was one woman who treated me like any other human. I modeled myself in her form.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...She is responsible for me gaining a heart of my own. I keep this form in reverence for her gift to me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A prostitute, and yet a saint: Shamhat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, being a prostitute meant something different back then than it does now. But there is no need to get into that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enkidu. You called Fujimaru the Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Does that mean you understand our situation?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes. A Holy Grail that disrupts time, and the alteration of history by the one who wields it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> All this resulted in the Singularities, a plot to destroy the Foundation of Humanity by the Mage King.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The Temple Matron of Uruk made the situation clear.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I came here because of her prophecy. I was told to protect the promised group of outsiders.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this era still hasn&#39;t been destroyed, correct? And you&#39;re fighting against the King of Mages?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Of course. I am not sure what the other eras were like, but people from the Age of Gods will not submit to world-ending disaster.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Whimsical gods have brought the world near to destruction many times in our era. People here are more resilient than you might think.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see...I understand. But somehow they can&#39;t do anything about little things like lovers&#39; spats and marital fights.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes, that is indeed troubling. They band together against the big problems, but struggle with the small ones.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But that is how it always is with humanity. Though, as you can see with how this town ended up...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Anyway, enough with introductions. The Demonic Beasts will come back if we spend too much time here.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I will guide you somewhere safer. We can discuss trivial matters on the way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks, Enkidu.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My name is Fujimaru. Thanks.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You have your right hand out. Is there something wrong?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a handshake, Enkidu. Senpai wants to shake hands with you.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, so this is...My apologies. I am still not used to this.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Now, formally, it is nice to meet you, Fujimaru. Is this how you shake hands?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good. Now that we&#39;ve all got to know each other better, let&#39;s move. Are you going to take them to Uruk?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s the largest city in that world. The Leylines there should be stable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinci keeps pestering me to set up the circle.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Circle...A summoning circle, correct? Understood. Let us hurry.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, yes. We will take the longer route to get there, so please bear that in mind.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> We should try to avoid the Demonic Beasts. There is nothing more important than ensuring everyone&#39;s safety.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. We will leave it up to you, Enkidu. Thank you for helping us out.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No, I am glad to do it. I&#39;m pleased the Master from Chaldea has turned out to be someone like you.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I thought...Well, it was said that a representative of humanity would come...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So I was on alert, thinking someone like Gilgamesh would come. But I&#39;m glad that fear proved unfounded.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Welcome to the old forgotten land of the gods, Mesopotamia. I welcome you as a representative of the new age, Fujimaru.</p><h2 id="section-2-humanity-s-oldest-fortress-city" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-humanity-s-oldest-fortress-city" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2: Humanity&#39;s Oldest Fortress City</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whew. In spite of the Demonic Beast attacks along the way, it looks like you made it safely past the ruins.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is...oh? It looks you&#39;re heading north?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Based on our mapping data, isn&#39;t Uruk to the southeast? I thought you&#39;d go south down the Euphrates.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Do not be so shortsighted, Dr. Romani. We&#39;d enter a different goddess&#39;s territory down south—</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, right. You do not know the current situation in Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Let me start with that. To be blunt, humanity in Mesopotamia is on the brink of extinction.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Roughly 80% of the population here has been slaughtered.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The survivors are huddled in the city of Uruk, facing the ever-looming moment of extinction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Who is causing chaos in this era? Does that person have the Holy Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The king?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yup, yup. We&#39;d all think that, naturally. After all, the king of this era is the tyrant Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s not hard to imagine him using the Grail&#39;s power to oppress his people and lead the world to destruction!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it the leader of the Demonic Beasts?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The boss of the Demonic Beasts we encountered in the ruins...That is indeed a possibility.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Many Demonic Beasts appear in myths, and Mesopotamian myths are no exception.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Furthermore, in those Mesopotamian myths, there&#39;s a great goddess dubbed the “Mother of Demonic Beasts. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If one of them has the Holy Grail...</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No, nobody has hold of the Holy Grail. Something other than the Mage King&#39;s followers is destroying this world.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Mesopotamia faces destruction by something equal to, if not greater than, the King of Mages.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes. To be blunt, the gods are the ones destroying humanity.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It&#39;s not the God you&#39;re thinking of. The gods of this era are different...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The Three Goddess Alliance has descended on this era and claimed roughly 60% of the lands of Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> G-Goddesses, you say!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Like Artemis back in Okeanos!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, she was a goddess that was forced to tag along with Orion, so I don&#39;t think she&#39;s powerful enough to destroy the world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Like those devils of the Shapeless Isle!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha, as the one who has been victimized the most, let me tell you this! Those three are devils indeed! Especially the oldest one!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She lacks Authority because of her low rank among Divine Spirits, but if there are any male dictators, she can destroy the world another way!</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So there are Divine Spirit Servants in Chaldea too...? That is...slightly unexpected.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I thought such powerful summons were impossible outside of the Age of Gods...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, all the goddesses we&#39;ve encountered so far have been diminished somewhat in order to be contained in Servant form.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Their Spirit Origins have been on par with Heroic Spirits, so I don&#39;t think any have the Authority of a god.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Good. That is more understandable. This must be what you call a fragment of the spirit.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> However, the goddesses that have appeared here in Mesopotamia are different.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It is true they are Divine Spirits summoned by someone, but their Spirit Origins are on the level of true gods.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The monsters we fought earlier were subordinates–no, it&#39;s better to say children–of one of the goddesses.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The Three Goddess Alliance is, as the name suggests, three female deities working together.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> We know almost nothing about them, individually or as a group. Their objective, though, is crystal clear.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...And that is?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...The annihilation of the human race. Complete extinction. No survivors.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> “Eradicate humanity here to cause everything rising from this era to die out. ” That seems to be their objective.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Impossible...They&#39;re not just seeking to cause chaos in this era, but to annihilate mankind itself!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s no different from the King of Mages! If they&#39;re goddesses, aren&#39;t they on humanity&#39;s side!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There&#39;s never been a time when gods allied with humans. Humans are nothing more than worker drones to the gods.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It is said the gods of Mesopotamia created humans to be “those who perform their jobs in their stead. ”</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Whatever the truth is, for gods, humans are objects to keep, not objects to love.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Gods who love humans merely suffer from a logical error due to being multifunctional.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Take the great goddess Inanna–known as Ishtar in Akkadian–for instance.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That goddess has a confusing nature unfit for a deity. She loves abundant harvests, man, war, and being at the top.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> She claims to love humans, but favors war where humans kill each other. Isn&#39;t that contradictory?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, yeah...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s a double standard...</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Right. That&#39;s why it&#39;s helpful to think of it as a kind of logical error.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Lack of uniformity from having too many elements and functions. Put simply, she&#39;s just insane.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Interesting interpretation. Contradictions are created from having too many functions...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In polytheism, the roles of the gods are subdivided into small parts. In other words, they are all specialists, so nothing is wasted.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why so few gods have this error that makes them love humans. Is that what you&#39;re saying?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes. Usually the demiurge who possesses many functions and roles is the one that loves humans.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The more roles a god has, the more they make logical mistakes. Just like humans.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Anyway, it&#39;s useless to preach about gods here.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The three goddesses that appeared here each used their own methods to destroy Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The greatest force of the three drifted over from Greece: The “Goddess of Demonic Beasts. ”</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Yeah, you should see it soon. I think it&#39;s simpler if you see for yourself rather than trying to explain.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> From this plateau, you have a clear view of the situation at the Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That is the first threat. The evil offspring of the Goddess of Demonic Beasts, who crushed the very center of this world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s...a castle wall?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It looks like it has no end...</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Right. When Demonic Beasts filled the northern area, it was made with materials salvaged by dismantling Babylon.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Nowadays, it is called...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The largest and final fort that protects human hope and the four corners of the earth: Absolute Demonic Front Babylonia.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Amazing...Not as impressive as the Holy City&#39;s outer wall, but it&#39;s a tough wall that stretches out over the horizon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Something is moving outside the wall...Are those the Demonic Beasts from earlier?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, that&#39;s not possible! I see thousands of them!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not all. To the north, I&#39;m getting magical energy readings orders of magnitude greater!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Unbelievable. My goodness. There&#39;s no way humanity can possibly survive something like this!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Demonic Beasts earlier had power equal to a small autonomous tank! Now there&#39;re thousands of them! You can&#39;t possibly hold that off with a single wall!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh...Doctor...I can hardly believe what I&#39;m seeing either, but...that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re doing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There appear to be soldiers outside the wall, and they seem to be holding against the rushing Demonic Beasts...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I-is that possible!? Just how powerful are these Sumerians!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Do not be surprised by that. They have been holding that wall for six months already.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> S-Six months!? No human could do that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...But, it&#39;s amazing...They must be extremely proficient soldiers...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It is exactly as Mash has surmised.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The fortress city that fights Demonic Beasts day and night. An endless onslaught of Demonic Beasts driven back by its soldiers.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But the humans suffer fewer casualties...Precise army utilization. Seamless shift changes.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Training new soldiers even during combat, putting them on the front line, and having the wounded rest and concentrate on healing.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This is the ultimate form of point defense. At that rate, they should be able to hold the front line for another month.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...They&#39;re clearly losing, but, in the grand scheme of things, somehow winning...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wonder what kind of person is in command of that fortress...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Probably someone very patient.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Probably someone very muscular.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Yes, truly. They shed needless blood as well.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There is no need to annihilate everything. They will die off on their own, so this is useless.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Enkidu...?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> My apologies. That was a bit much. Even Demonic Beasts are living beings. I was too emotional.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If you are interested, you can join the front line anytime. I hear the recruitment test for Uruk is very lax nowadays.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Y-yeah, it&#39;s definitely a situation we&#39;d like to help out with, but Fujimaru alone won&#39;t change much.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For now, let&#39;s hurry to Uruk. The fact that military operations are in full force means that their commander–their king–stands strong.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If the threat upon Uruk isn&#39;t a king gone mad with the Grail, but this “Three Goddess Alliance,” negotiations will be simple.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Request an audience with the king, explain our objective, find the Holy Grail within this era, and recover it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ll think about dealing with that Northern Wall afterwards. Got that, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Understood, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Yes. Let&#39;s hurry to Uruk in the meantime.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Are you done chatting? Then let&#39;s hurry on ahead.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> As we were assaulted by Demonic Beasts earlier, this area is likely still dangerous. For now, let&#39;s get under cover of the forest.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> We are almost at the safe zone. We should make it by sunset.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So this is the Cedar Forest? Legends say it was protected by the Demonic Beast Humbaba...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Though I thought it was believed to be located east of Uruk, in the Zagros Mountains beyond the Tigris...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, there are two versions of the story. The Sumerian and Akkadian versions differ.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The older records put the Cedar Forest to the west.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So it makes sense that we would find it here, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s a strangely dark forest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yeah. I agree. The Cedar Forest in the Epic of Gilgamesh was a holy place.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It was bright enough that they called it the “Forest of White Cedars. ” But this place...It&#39;s like being in the belly of the beast.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But it&#39;s the other way to Uruk...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. We&#39;re walking farther away.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Is something wrong? What&#39;s the matter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (What should we do, Senpai? Shall we point out that we are going farther away from Uruk? )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (...)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...Let&#39;s see what happens. )</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, are you worried about the direction we are going? There is a wharf at the river up ahead.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There is a boat docked there. Once we get to the wharf, all we have to do is take it downstream.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I am sure you are tired, but hang in there. Once we get through the forest, it will all be over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, that&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh my! What wonderful news! I didn&#39;t know there was a wharf up ahead!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hey, sorry to scare you! I&#39;m not an enemy, so hear me out.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> We&#39;re stranded. As you can see, we didn&#39;t know our way through these trails and got lost.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I figured we were going to end up monster food, but luck must be on our side!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> See, Ana? Don&#39;t you think you were right to follow me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> We weren&#39;t lucky enough to reach our destination this time, but we met locals who know the way.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Good things come to those who wait! One step forward, two steps back! I didn&#39;t expect to see humans in the territory of the Goddess of Demonic Beasts!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai, these people who came out of the forest...I&#39;ve seen them somewhere before—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, could this guy be...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who&#39;s the girl next to him?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Are you lost? That is unfortunate.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> We&#39;re heading to Uruk. Will you come with us?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Of course. We&#39;d follow you even if you refused to let us. We&#39;ve been walking three days straight, and my legs are so stiff.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But, hmm...Tagging along with someone when we don&#39;t know their names is unsettling.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You there. Can you tell us your name?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t tell you mine. Nor can the girl.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s a unique name. Sure don&#39;t hear it around here. And the lady, then?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> More suspicious people!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now, now, don&#39;t be like that. Actually, we heard your name already.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You&#39;re Fujimaru, right? And who&#39;s the lady?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My name is Mash Kyrielight. This is Enkidu.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Enkidu? Did you say that&#39;s Enkidu? Hmm...That&#39;s a problem. A big problem.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Why? Is there something wrong with me?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s just that if you&#39;re Enkidu, I&#39;d have to start questioning my own memory.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh is commanding the front line in Uruk. He&#39;s just returned from his quest for the herb of immortality.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Which means...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whaaa— Hold up! That doesn&#39;t make any sense!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If we&#39;re in the era where Gilgamesh has already returned from his search for immortality, something&#39;s very wrong!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He didn&#39;t set out on that quest until AFTER the death of his friend...Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And that means, if he&#39;s already returned...Enkidu should be long dead!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He might exist as a Servant, but he can&#39;t be alive!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Enkidu, what&#39;s going on here...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, get away from him!</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Hah...hahaha, hahahaha!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yeah, I figured this little farce of mine wasn&#39;t going to last long!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Hello, Fujimaru. Hello, incompetent fools of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Mmm...I was so close, though! Just a little more, and I would&#39;ve seen something so very fun!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You&#39;re supposed to be the last hope of old humanity, right?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> All humans are failures, but truly YOU are the most pathetic of them all.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If I had managed to offer the goddess up ahead something as rare as you, I would&#39;ve been able to see a living hell!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you led us into a trap...! Are you really Enkidu!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Of course. I talk like Enkidu. I have Enkidu&#39;s powers. I am Enkidu itself.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Why would you think that Enkidu would be on your side, anyway?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I am a weapon created by the gods. Of course I&#39;d side with the goddesses.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, enough talk! Enkidu&#39;s magical energy already rivals a Demon God Pillar&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how it happened, but the thing you&#39;re looking at is aligned with Solomon, the enemy of humanity!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now that they lured you here, they&#39;ll never let Fujimaru return home alive!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You have to fight Enkidu! It&#39;s the only way to survive!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> How rude. Up until a moment ago, we were so friendly to each other.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Ah well, sad to say, he&#39;s right. You were doomed the moment you stepped into this forest.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame I can&#39;t take you alive, but I can at least present your head to Mother.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...All right. It&#39;s time for your journey to come to an end, Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enkidu is taking a combat stance!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...we know how powerful he is! There&#39;s no way that we can...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You have a snowball&#39;s chance in hell of winning. Do you know why I fought alongside you?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So I could show you just how much weaker you are! Ahaha! Humans are so pathetic!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So die. Die, old humans, to the sound of my laughter! Fall into the waste dump, as you envy this perfect weapon!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Humph. I have no idea what this fake Enkidu is going on about, but I understand the situation.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Fujimaru and Lady Mash are at a disadvantage. Ana, help them.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Fine. This wasn&#39;t part of the deal, but I will protect them.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Pathetic. You seem like a Servant, but you&#39;re no great hero. You&#39;re second-rate at best.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Did you really think such paltry Mystics would stand a chance against my attacks?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no need for me to defeat you. The conditions for victory in this battle are different.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Having a human-like intelligence can sometimes backfire on you. You should take this opportunity to learn that.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This is...I see. I&#39;ve been caught in an illusory dream halfway through.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Which means that&#39;s the mage working for Uruk...I finally got to meet him, even if it was dumb luck...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> How irritating. I hate to admit this, but he&#39;s just like the legend says: good at running away.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Capturing him would be extremely difficult. Killing him, even harder.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Which means there&#39;s only one way to break that spell of his...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I guess I&#39;ll have to give up for now. I can&#39;t leave her alone for a whole day.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> She&#39;s such a child, considering how big she is...If I turn my back for a minute, she goes on a rampage.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been so careful and methodical in our planning and wiping out humanity.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If she gets out of hand, it could be over in a day. That&#39;s not good at all. Seriously.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I mean, if we just killed them, we&#39;d be no different than humanity.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing wrong with killing, but you need a reason, and a theme. That&#39;s our duty as the new humans.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hm!? We were fighting against a fake Enkidu...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Enkidu vanished...!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Hahaha! Wow, that worked out great!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I figured they wouldn&#39;t be able to resist mental attacks yet. I felt a little remorse because it was like tricking an innocent child, but oh well.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> We needed to survive. Nothing wrong with a bit of ungentlemanly conduct.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> After all, we were fighting the mediator of the Three Goddess Alliance, the traitor to all Uruks, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That young man...Or was it a young woman? Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. They&#39;ve killed countless soldiers.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> After all, as the leader of the Demonic Beasts, they are working directly for the Mage King!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Enkidu&#39;s working for the King of Mages...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Was that really Enkidu...!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Yes. They said as much while laying waste to many fortress cities. And while many Uruks seem to want to believe it isn&#39;t the real thing...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...unfortunately, that combat capability could belong to none but Enkidu.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You should be careful. They may look beautiful, but they&#39;re actually a weapon forged to kill humans.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The Enkidu we met has reverted to their cruel nature, to the way they were before they met King Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Anyway, all that aside...Let me formally say hello!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I saved you when you were in danger. Please, shower me, your savior, with your humble words of gratitude!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, right! Th-thank you, person we&#39;ve never met before!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait...never met? Senpai, have we met this person before?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh...? Fou&#39;s climbing a tree?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoufou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> His claws are out. And he&#39;s twisting his body?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foufoufooou!!! Murder Merlin foooouu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fou spun and slammed into him at full speed!?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Dofooou!?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> What are you doing, you feral beast!? Have you forgotten the years I took care of you!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I never should&#39;ve taken you in, you wicked beast! Cath Palug! Take that, you cath-tastrophe!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> How many busty women have you decieved with your cuteness!? You get all the ladies&#39; attention just because you&#39;re fluffy!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I feel like an idiot for having to work so hard! Don&#39;t you feel bad for making me pull out all the stops!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is he...scratching at Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Merlin, please limit your lunacy to when you&#39;re alone at night.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I led the enemy away, as you ordered.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t appear that they will pursue us, but I recommend we move to our destination as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, glad to hear it. Good work, Ana. That&#39;s a big help.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...This battle was not part of our contract. Do not thank me. Think over your actions.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hahaha! That&#39;s harsh. But you know how they say...Something, something...“Helping others...” Yeah! It&#39;s good...I think.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now that Ana&#39;s back, we should introduce ourselves.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I am Merlin. I&#39;m actually a Servant. This is Ana. She is a Servant too.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You can call me “The Amazing Merlin the Great. ” What about you, Ana? What do you want them to call you?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...It doesn&#39;t matter. Ana is fine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-thank you so much for saving us back there,Miss Ana.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> No “Miss. ” Just call me Ana.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...And I don&#39;t like humans. Please keep your distance if possible.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t worry about Ana. She just really doesn&#39;t like humans. There&#39;s nothing more to it than that.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> More importantly...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> HOLD IT!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is all so incredibly shocking that I&#39;ve been sitting, frozen in front of my screen. But, now that I&#39;ve thawed out, let me just say...HOLD IT!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Merlin!? Did you say Merlin!? The great mage of the Isle of Britain, born of a human and an incubus...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...one of the world&#39;s greatest kingmakers, and the world&#39;s biggest scoundrel! THE Merlin is right there with you!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And as a Servant!? Merlin, the Grand Mage who shouldn&#39;t be able to die until the end of the world!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fwahaha! I knew I could count on you for a grand introduction, Romani Archaman!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Indeed. I&#39;m none other than THE Merlin, Grand Caster. The greatest, most powerful, most handsome mage of all time!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well actually, I only have the right to be given the Grand title. My Spirit Origin is but a normal Caster.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE! There&#39;s no way Merlin could be a Heroic Spirit!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I mean, you clearly look like him, but you&#39;re lying, you phony! Show us your true form!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is ridiculous...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s gotten into the Doctor?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably...because of discrepancies in the legends about Merlin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Merlin is the fabled mage from the Isle of Britain who primarily appears in Arthurian legend.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was his help that guided King Arthur–Altria Pendragon–to the throne.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Afterward, he served as King Arthur&#39;s court mage and adviser, and appeared in many tales.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But due to his womanizing habits, he was driven from Britain and eventually ended up in the utopia of Avalon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After repenting his wicked ways–his sins–he was imprisoned in a tower there. A tower he built himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He punished himself by watching over the world in the cramped tower, never dying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Both Avalon and the tower Merlin is trapped inside exist outside of time, and will only disappear when history ends.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, Merlin is still alive. And no one who&#39;s alive can become a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s what the Doctor is trying to point out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Mash. Merlin is a hero who isn&#39;t counted as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Though it is possible he could be summoned by some kind of irregularity, like Scáthach...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But in terms of combat, he&#39;s completely useless!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All Casters with the potential to be a Grand Caster are powerful clairvoyants. Solomon&#39;s eyes, for instance, can see the past and future.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh can see the future. And that scoundrel in front of you can see everything in the present.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Some can see more clearly or further than others, but all possess the power as observers.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But their superpower is basically magic sight. And Merlin&#39;s the worst of them!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s nothing more than a magical telescope!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The only thing Merlin can do is view the entire world from the Tower of Avalon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In the modern world, it&#39;d be like having the power to look into any computer network—Oh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Um, that&#39;s amazing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not very flashy, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, excuse me while I butt in☆</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m busy proving Fujimaru&#39;s existence, so I don&#39;t get many chances to talk this time around.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But since Roman&#39;s frozen stiff, I have some questions for Merlin.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> First, thank you. You&#39;ve secretly provided us with magical energy resources, haven&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Incineration of Humanity destroyed the world, but Avalon, where you are, is still standing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So you&#39;ve been using a replenishing method similar to the Rayshift to kindle Chaldea&#39;s reactor...The Fire of Prometheus.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been doing it in secret, and only when we really needed it, without the King of Mages finding out. Impressive.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I was just helping out. After all, I hold the world record for being the oldest shut-in.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I had nothing else to do, so I&#39;ve just been helping Romani here and there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But it still doesn&#39;t make sense that you&#39;re a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;re still in Avalon, right? So how&#39;d you become a Servant?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The reason and the method. Unless you tell us these two things, we can&#39;t trust you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, Enkidu just attacked us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Based on the search plan Chaldea made, Enkidu was our most trusted candidate for navigator.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But then Enkidu turned around and betrayed us almost immediately.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We certainly can&#39;t put our guard down around another newcomer who seems to be friendly...You can see why Romani&#39;s worried.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm...I see. So that&#39;s what got that idiot so mad, huh?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fine. But I can&#39;t tell you the reason. I&#39;ll just tell you it has something to do with this Singularity.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I can, however, tell you the method. It&#39;s very simple, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This Singularity manifested in an age that predates my appearance on Earth. In other words, my body doesn&#39;t exist here.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Which means that in this world, it could theoretically be said that I am dead.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I used that fact to make myself a Servant. Part of it was that I was called forth by a strong summoner.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A strong summoner...Is there a Master in this era besides Senpai?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, of course. He&#39;s the one who summoned me, and I now serve as his court mage.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> On the other hand, the influence of the Grail summoned Ana. She&#39;s a Rogue Servant. That is, she has no Master.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I actually just met her two days ago.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I was lost in this forest, and bumped into her. We got along, and made a contract to support each others&#39; goals.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s awful. He tricked me.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Merlin is the embodiment of every kind of dishonesty in this world. And that is being nice about it.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hehe. Aww, stop it! You&#39;re flattering me!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I see. I understand the general situation now. Romani, give it up. That&#39;s the real Merlin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ugh...My stomach...This situation&#39;s a mess already, and now with Merlin showing up...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But we don&#39;t have time to be picky. Whether he is a scoundrel or not, there&#39;s no denying that he&#39;s one of the greatest mages.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Did you manifest to work with Chaldea, Merlin?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Will you fight with us to repair the Singularity, stop the Incineration of Humanity, and save human history?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course I will. My one joy in life is watching the present.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Without it, I&#39;ll just be a lonely man staring at the Garden in my tower.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s a terrifying future. So of course I&#39;ll help you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And you don&#39;t honestly think that you folks have been the only ones cheering for Fujimaru as they got this far, do you?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been watching your whole fight on the edge of my seat.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to not let me be part of your group now, do you? Though I know I&#39;m a threat as a Caster.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m a Grand Caster, after all. A chosen one, just like the King of Mages.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> All the other Servants, especially the Casters, are going to get jealous of me...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> In the end, they&#39;ll realize they can&#39;t beat me and get shuffled off to the backup group!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...(Annoyed)</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Ahem. Sorry, seems I talked too much.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s punishment for not listening to Ana&#39;s warning. A group of enemies is incoming.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This is, however, a great chance to say something I&#39;ve always wanted to say.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> “Everyone, be careful! Wyverns incoming! ”</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Humph. Well, Romani? Sounded just like you, didn&#39;t it? Give me a score!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. Yeah, that was just like me. You get a ten out of ten!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, Fujimaru, do me a favor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> When he&#39;s distracted during battle, punch him in the face for me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That took care of them all. Let&#39;s head to Uruk now, for real.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fujimaru, it&#39;s your duty to explain Chaldea&#39;s mission to the king of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> When you meet the king, it should become clear what you are meant to do. Oh! Also, Uruk would be ideal as a temporary HQ.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s what Merlin recommends...but what do you think, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want to see the king ASAP.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I want to set up a summoning circle ASAP.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s settled. We&#39;ll go back to Uruk, but what about you, Ana? Will you come with us?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t sign up for this. I was told we would defeat the goddess.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Don&#39;t get so angry. I said I would lead you to the temple, but you understand the current circumstances, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We can&#39;t enter that temple alone. For now, slow and steady wins the race.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...But...going to a human settlement...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please, Ana.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go together.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no need to shake on it. And no need to be so polite. Just keep away from me.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...All right, fine. For now, I&#39;ll leave the forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (I have a feeling Ana isn&#39;t actually so difficult...)</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been marching for an entire day. You must be tired, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But we&#39;re almost there. Just hang in there a little longer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That area is easy to observe. We can finally have a proper operation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just a little bit more...One more day, and you should arrive at what I believe is the city of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s easy to observe this area because it&#39;s still close to the “former Mesopotamian world. ”</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The only safe place is the area around Uruk, where the king is going strong and maintaining an environment livable for humans.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Northern Mesopotamia has become a kingdom of Demonic Beasts, while the south has become a mysterious jungle that no one returns from.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> For humans who survived attacks by Demonic Beasts, the city of Uruk is the only refuge.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now I understand the situation here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> With the rise of the Three Goddess Alliance, the Sumerian city-states have been dealt a devastating blow.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Many cities have been destroyed and many people have fled to Uruk, the center of this world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Demonic Beasts&#39; invasion up north is the most serious issue at hand, as they&#39;re currently the major force wiping out humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In response, Uruk&#39;s king has dissolved the city of Babylon and hastily constructed a great fortress known as the Northern Wall of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words, Babylonia has turned itself into the front line for the war against Demonic Beasts. It&#39;s the last fort protecting the Mesopotamian world. Correct?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s still unknown how the King of Mages influenced this era, but if the Demonic Beasts bring down Uruk, human history is finished.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If the first dynasty of Sumer, the blueprint of city-states, is destroyed, there is no certainty in what will become of the human race afterwards.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> During the same period, Egypt&#39;s first dynasty was also flourishing, but they alone can&#39;t preserve the Foundation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Therefore, there are two things you need to do.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> First, search for the Holy Grail the King of Mages sent to this era and retrieve it. That should give us an idea about his plot.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Next, take down the Three Goddess Alliance if possible. Although that fight should belong to the people of this era...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...if we do nothing, the Foundation of Humanity can&#39;t be restored. This task is beyond our abilities, but it is what we must do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do we know about the alliance?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Not much. Out of the three goddesses, I only know the True Name for one.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> There&#39;s the goddess controlling all Demonic Beasts up north, the goddess residing in jungles in the south,</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> then there&#39;s the soaring goddess who has no fixed residence.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The biggest threat is the goddess in the north, but the soaring goddess is another problem altogether.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> In a way, she&#39;s the most troublesome goddess in Mesopotamia, even more so than the goddess controlling the Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The people of Uruk are still puzzled over what to do about her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What were you doing, Merlin?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I was looking for something, under orders from the king. That&#39;s also why I was in the Cedar Forest.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I was searching for something called the Tablet of Destinies, but I&#39;ve put that on hold so I can guide you to Uruk.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hmmm. It seems all roads lead to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Merlin. Is King Gilgamesh really the one ruling over Uruk now?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, it is indeed King Gilgamesh! The most tyrannical of all ancient kings!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He severed his ties with the gods because of their arrogance! The most beautiful women and treasures are his to own!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The most irrational and unreasonable king who would just as readily kill his followers as his enemies!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s scary!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So he&#39;s just a villain?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes. The king of Uruk in ancient Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He is a historical figure who appeared in the Epic of Gilgamesh, mankind&#39;s oldest heroic epic,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> as well as other ancient Mesopotamian stories.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> His historical name was Bilgamesh, where “bilga” means ancestors, and “mesh” means hero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> His father was King Lugalbanda, a demigod. His mother was the goddess Ninsun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He was a hero born of god and human, which made him a combination of the two.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In his youth, he was fond of people, while also being a sage grounded in reason,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> but he became the complete opposite in his adolescence. He turned into an out-of-control tyrant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He gathered the land&#39;s fortune, demanded prosperity in toil from his citizens, and abandoned the gods as relics of the past.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To admonish him, the gods created the being that appeared before us, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As fate would have it, Enkidu and King Gilgamesh fought for three days and three nights in front of a temple in Uruk.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The battle was a draw. Afterwards, King Gilgamesh recognized Enkidu as his only friend.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> His tyranny relaxed a bit and he governed the country while still being feared by the citizens of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> However?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. King Gilgamesh matured as a king after gaining a friend, but encountered many trials.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You know quite a bit, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. After we found out about the era of the Seventh Singularity, I studied so I could be useful to you, Senpai...</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, the Cedar of Lebanon story.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh set foot into the holy ground of the Forest of White Cedars and killed Humbaba, the Demonic Beast guarding it.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Due to Mesopotamia&#39;s climate, the country was always in need of lumber.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Bringing home quality cedar was his obligation, as both a king and a hero.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> However, his achievement captured the attention of a wicked goddess.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The goddess&#39;s curiosity drove her to desire all things unusual, beautiful and praise-worthy.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Who was this wicked goddess you ask? She was Inanna, Queen of Heaven, daughter of An, also known as Ishtar. And she set her sights on Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The world&#39;s greatest goddess confessed her love to the King of Heroes. However, King Gilgamesh rejected her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Why? Because Gilgamesh knew how coldly she treated her husband Dumuzid.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This must have been quite a shock to Ishtar. To be rejected by a man...by a mere human!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Furious, Ishtar went crying to her father...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...who, out of love for her, gave her something terrible.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A Divine Beast powerful enough to destroy the world...Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven. With it, Ishtar tried to destroy Uruk.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The bull damaged crops, made the rivers run dry, and summoned a tempest before being defeated by Gilgamesh and Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Uruk was saved, but by killing the holy beast, Enkidu incurred the wrath of the gods and for their sins, the gods killed Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It was, after all, the gods who created Enkidu in the first place. In modern parlance, the gods flipped Enkidu&#39;s off switch.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Honestly. The Mesopotamian gods&#39; greatest fault was being pushovers to their daughters.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Between An and Enki of the Abyss, Ishtar was given a multitude of treasures.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, yes. From that story alone, it&#39;s easy to see that Ishtar had a pampered upbringing...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. The death of his only friend, Enkidu, was King Gilgamesh&#39;s first real encounter with mortality.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Death claimed even Enkidu, the mighty king&#39;s equal. Gilgamesh, in turn, began to wonder whether it was possible to conquer death.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As a result, King Gilgamesh embarked on a quest for immortality. He went to the ends of the earth, descended into the Abyss...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and at its bottom, obtained the Herb of Rejuvenation. However...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It was stolen by a snake, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Gilgamesh returned to the surface and went to bathe. While he soaked, a snake crept in and ate the herb.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And so, snakes gained the ability to shed their skin, and humans forever lost the chance to become immortal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No one could ever really know what effect that had on the king&#39;s state of mind.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, King Gilgamesh returned to Uruk, but because of his absence, the city had nearly fallen into ruin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Reflecting on his own selfishness, he decided to try and restore Uruk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> From then on, he never went on quests, instead focusing on his kingly duties.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There you have it. The Epic of Gilgamesh in a nutshell.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The epic was set down in poetry, so we can only imagine what the truth may have been.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Did he really seek out the magical herb because he feared death, or was it because he loathed death?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I think it would be interesting to ask the man himself. Oh, but...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I suppose he isn&#39;t the type of person who would speak freely about his memories. Unless you were his traveling companion or something.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The point is, this is a man who had the guts to call a goddess as powerful, though spoiled, as Ishtar a fool and kick her to the curb...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...while bragging about possessing the originals of all the Noble Phantasms and having the greatest advantage over any hero.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes, is an extremely arrogant, cold-blooded tyrant. Remember that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. And that is the legend of Gilgamesh, King of Heroes. Was it useful, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...(And what am I supposed to do? )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...(So what&#39;s going to happen? )</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. It looks like you don&#39;t want to go, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can understand that. After all, I&#39;m trembling with fear, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And it&#39;s a town in 2600 B. C. , right? There&#39;s a cold-blooded king in a violent world where might makes right.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure culture shock is inevitable, so you should mentally prepare yourself, yep.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Excuse me. We&#39;ve got trouble. Demonic Beasts that have strayed from the pack are heading our way.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Are you still going to talk? If so, I can handle them alone...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no, we&#39;ll go! Thank you for pointing them out, Miss Ana!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...No need to use “Miss. ”But I&#39;d appreciate some extra hands.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s been three days since we Rayshifted to the ruins of Babylon...Master, we&#39;ve finally arrived at Uruk.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like we&#39;ll have to pass through an inspection checkpoint before we get into the city...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s still some distance between us. Maybe we can sneak into the city without them noticing...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hello!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, hello. I see you&#39;re full of energy. I&#39;m glad to see that!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can we sneak through...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, good idea. I have a hunch any quarrel here would escalate into a battle...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Oh no! You over there! If you stray from the road, you&#39;ll be cursed by the Ritual Sect!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Are you refugees from Ur? Then please be careful. The king has given the Ritual Sect more power, what with it being a war and all...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Uruk is surrounded by a ritual warding the Demonic Beasts, but it seems to have some effects on humans as well.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...okay. Thank you for the warning.</p><hr><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never seen you before. Which city are you from?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, they&#39;re refugees from Girsu. As for myself, I engage in business. With the Ritual Sect&#39;s permission, as you can see.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to evacuate them into Uruk. Are there any procedures I need to follow?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> That&#39;s the sigil of Lady Siduri. You may pass.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> As for reception of refugees, Nutra&#39;s shop in the west market should be good today.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> We just received word that the storage space on the second floor is opening up for refugees.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Daily necessities can be picked up at each gate.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> You can register as a temporary citizen at Rana&#39;s brothel. Please go there if you&#39;re planning to stay for more than two weeks.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> You must be tired from your long trip. Get some rest first.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Welcome to the city of Uruk. We are fighting to survive, and we spare no efforts if it&#39;s for the cause.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-okay. Thank you very much!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (That was unexpected! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on...?</p><hr><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Hmm. Hold on. I can&#39;t turn a blind eye on your fellow traveler.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> You in the black hood. Yes, you. Stop.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (...! Master, Miss Ana has a blade under her robe...! )</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...What is it?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed you managed to walk all the way here with your small build.... Here. These are just leftovers, but please take them with you.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> They&#39;re candies my daughter gave me as an afternoon snack.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...B-but, um. I am, um...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> It&#39;d be a great help if you would accept them. You see, these are a little too sweet for me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ana, why don&#39;t you just take them?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...(Nod)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll take them myself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, you&#39;re an adult. Control yourself!</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Then, I&#39;ll take just one. Thank you...very much.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> No problem. I was stationed here because of my good memory.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> I know your faces now, so I hope we meet again alive.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Whether you set forth to battle, or return to your homeland, seeing you alive and well will bring me joy.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian A:</strong><br> New arrivals!

Looking forward to your help!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier B:</strong><br> No, wait, the armory needs people too! At this rate, we&#39;ll be sending twigs instead of spears to the Northern Wall!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier B:</strong><br> Those that know how to make weapons, come to the armory!

Celebrations, gifts for your wives...Ask us about anything!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh—</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Wh—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wh—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What a bustling crowd!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. The soldier earlier, the energy on the street...Is this really a city facing the end of the world?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That it is. Welcome to Uruk, the oldest fortress city in human history.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Times may be dire, but the city remains lively. Everyone holds their heads high.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Smoke from the smithies rises everywhere, and the ringing of their hammers echoes day and night.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Everyone is nervous, and they&#39;re in a hurry, but they haven&#39;t forgotten to smile.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Despair has no place in this city. It is bustling with the will to fight and the will to survive!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s not all...Unbelievable...What an efficient cityscape.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Look at that map there. Each district is clearly separated by role, and transportation is perfectly linked!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Military production, construction, commerce, life...It&#39;s redesigned to provide for all those things.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How is this an ancient city!? This is a fighting city so perfect that it would even work today!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Sumerians started showing up in history around 4000 B. C. . But their civilization was quite elaborate.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s the oldest human civilization. It began when people abandoned a village-based society hosting thousands...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...and formed city-states housing tens of thousands of people by pioneering crop production boosts through irrigated farming.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course, with a country that big, the invention of writing and the implementation of higher education in schools was only a matter of time.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Though they were not blessed with lumber, the fertile lands sandwiched by the two great rivers created quality mud...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...which the Sumerians kneaded to make clay. That, in turn, was used to build many fortresses.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That is Mesopotamia, the land of mud, clay, wheat, and sheep.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now, Dr. Roman. You called the city “quite barbaric. ”Do you have anything to say?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t...I&#39;m sorry for underestimating it...I assumed it was just a city-state dependent on trade...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Good. Then we&#39;ll save a tour of the city for later. Let&#39;s head over to the ziggurat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The ziggurat...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A shrine and altar for the Mesopotamians. I believe that giant trapezoidal structure over there is it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A Mesopotamian shrine?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah. There is another shrine honoring Uruk&#39;s patron god, but unfortunately that particular deity has not been seen lately.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We&#39;re finally meeting King Gilgamesh. Let&#39;s head on with all due enthusiasm!</p><h2 id="section-3-gilgamesh-s-calamity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-gilgamesh-s-calamity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Gilgamesh&#39;s Calamity</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We were led right to the Royal Hall...I&#39;m surprised how friendly everyone is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Merlin&#39;s our fastpass.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Although all the maidens seem to be avoiding Merlin...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So...We&#39;re still a ways away, but is that King Gilgamesh over there?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Don&#39;t make me repeat myself! The newer the information about the war, the better! Keep bringing me reports!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> The harder we work, the less chance they&#39;ll have to attack! If you want to take it easy, keep fighting!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, sir! We&#39;ve added three supply trains to bring more clay tablets from the secretary every hour!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Good. Next. Is this today&#39;s list of shipments?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...The shipments from the city of Eresh are being delayed, eh...Did the Demonic Beasts set up a lair on the roads?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Send 20 men from the eastern barracks to clear the way. Temun can take command. It&#39;s his home. He knows it well.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Humph. Whose idiotic order was this!? Why aren&#39;t the Bašmu carcasses being sent to Eanna?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> The researchers have nothing to do! This is the time to put their annoying little brains to work!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, sir! I&#39;ll send them over to the Tiamat research team right away! Here is the answer from Girsu.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...! Curse that Temple Matron there in Girsu! I know there&#39;s still supplies stored in the temple of Bau!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Have them send everything to the front lines!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be the end of the world if the wall breaks. Tell her food can&#39;t be taken to the underworld!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Is this the report from the astrologers? Good. They match what I observed.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> The reading for the harvest season isn&#39;t bad. Give a lapis lazuli necklace to whoever is in charge.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> But there&#39;s no time for them to rest! Have them read the report from the Eridu search team!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...By the way, I heard that Tabado&#39;s daughter is giving birth. Send her a sacred prostitute to aid her, along with some healthy fruits.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> And pull Tabado off the Northern Wall, and give him three days&#39; rest. His grandson&#39;s face will give him courage.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...This isn&#39;t how I pictured him from the stories I just heard...I thought he would be more...terrible and irresponsible...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He&#39;s yelling at one priest after another...I can sense how busy he is from here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t seem like we will be able to get a word in...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But our issue is important too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s work up the courage to talk to him.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You shouldn&#39;t wait for the king to have a spare moment.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He won&#39;t wait for you either. You should say what&#39;s on your mind, even if it&#39;s a bit rude.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Especially if you believe that&#39;s the right thing to do. Now here we go...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh! I, Merlin, mage extraordinaire, have brought guests!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Busy? Yeah, I can see that, so don&#39;t worry! I&#39;ll bring them right now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh...? Wait...my hand...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s pulling me!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai...! Merlin, wait!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmm?</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> So you&#39;ve returned, Merlin. Welcome. The king is happy to see you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...(Unamused)</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> And? Did you bring back the Tablet of Destinies as your king ordered?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No, I didn&#39;t have any luck this time. It&#39;s not in the Cedar Forest.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Sheesh. If only you remembered where you left it, Your Majesty, I wouldn&#39;t have to work this hard.</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> Silence. Know your place, mage. The king just happened to be tired when he scribed the tablet.</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> Even I&#39;ve never heard of memory loss from exhaustion, but...</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> ...if the king says that&#39;s the case, then it must be. Do as he says and keep looking for it.</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> More importantly...Who are those people? They don&#39;t look like Uruks.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. I understand the situation. You may go, Siduri.</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh...? For you to bring out the Dingir...Don&#39;t tell me...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just as you suspected, be ready to clean the throne! No need to worry, I&#39;m simply sending two strangers back to the heavens!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m busy! Even the time I&#39;d have to spend to exchange words with you is too precious for me to spare!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Thus, I shall ascertain the truth of your words through battle! Prepare yourselves, mages of the Observatory!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...And Merlin, stand down! Do not interfere!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s great. I don&#39;t like to get my hands dirty. Ana, sorry, but would you give them a hand?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The king prides himself on his self-control, but let&#39;s be honest: he&#39;s not one to hold back in battle.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I mean, you prefer combat over conversation too, right? This is one of those fists speak louder than words moments!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...So I&#39;m being forced into a useless fight again...Please die, Merlin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Sorry! Please help me out, Ana!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry! Once this is over, let&#39;s get Merlin together!</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s all right. It&#39;s not your fault. I&#39;ll help you if you like.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The battle&#39;s over!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He attacked so suddenly that we fought back without thinking, but—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> His Majesty seems upset...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He didn&#39;t seem to like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. Halfway through the battle, he clearly started holding back.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Just who does he think he is, I wonder?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> A waste of time. I was curious to see what those tasked by heaven could do, but you&#39;re no more than mongrels!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You are unworthy of my help, and unfit to serve me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You aren&#39;t even worth punishing for messing up my throne room! I&#39;ll let you go this time, so begone!</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> Your Majesty, please, calm yourself...They seem like powerful warriors to me...</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> Are they the strangers you spoke of?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Merlin brought them here, so yes, they probably are. But...it&#39;s too soon. Far too soon.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> See that stupid look on [♂ his /♀ her] face? Still not a clue what&#39;s happening here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no point in talking to them. Merlin...It seems you let yourself get distracted.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm...For some reason, this is turning out to be my fault. Do you have anything to say, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> At this rate, he really will kick you out of here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay. (Work up the courage and give your name. )</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s not worth learning your name. Begone, scum.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Okay. (Have Mash do it. )</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You fool! Why are you having your Servant do the talking!? This should be the time to show who&#39;s the reliable one here!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I-I didn&#39;t expect things to go this bad...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on, Merlin!? The king doesn&#39;t seem interested in Chaldea at all!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s strange. I thought he and I were on the same wavelength there.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I mean, I didn&#39;t tell him what Chaldea was. Or what a Servant was.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Or about the Incineration of Humanity, or the King of Mages, or the Grails, or the Singularities, or any of that stuff.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But you know, he should be able to figure that out, right? He&#39;s a king, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you didn&#39;t tell him anything, then!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And you&#39;re the one who said he was really busy, right!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, hmm. You&#39;re right! Oops! I should&#39;ve explained things, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes! That&#39;s Merlin for you! Totally useless!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now you&#39;re our only hope, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s try persuading King Gilgamesh once more! Even he&#39;ll understand if you explain properly!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for that. I can hear you, concealed one.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Know that I am capable of all things, and so possess all knowledge.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Thus, there is nothing my eyes cannot see! Though as you can see, I&#39;ve yet to fulfill my destiny...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I am aware of the process of summoning and commanding Heroic Spirits...What you call “Heroic Spirit Summoning. ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...And that my name is on the list of those “Spirit Origins” that you possess as well.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph. Well, that third-rate Master there probably lacks the power to summon me.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Perhaps, one day...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh is from this era. But even though Merlin never told him,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> he knows all about Chaldea, and the fact that he&#39;s going to become a Heroic Spirit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Which makes it even more important that he listens to us...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right! Let&#39;s at least talk about the Grail!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right, Master! Hear us, King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t recover the Grail that&#39;s somewhere in this era, the Singularity will destroy humanity.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So we need to find the Grail as fast as possible...The Grail...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong? You&#39;re after the Grail, aren&#39;t you? And...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m detecting the Grail! I had a hunch, but it looks like King Gilgamesh already has it!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course. All the treasures in this world belong to me. I obtained the omnipotent wish granter a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably what the Three Goddess Alliance is after. Otherwise they&#39;d have no reason to attack Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And don&#39;t you dare ask me to give it to you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason for me to give you any of my treasures.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So, if you ask for the Grail, be prepared to give me more than just your life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...true. We don&#39;t have anything to offer in exchange...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then what if we defeat the Three Goddess Alliance?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Heh.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahaha! Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahah!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Defeat them? You&#39;re going to defeat those goddesses? Siduri, bring me water! My life&#39;s in danger!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> These fools may make me laugh myself to death! Merlin brought me the future&#39;s greatest clowns!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh...Wow, that was a good one. I&#39;ll put it down in the court records. It&#39;ll say, “The king is in great abdominal pain. ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But knowing everything, I say this: I&#39;ve no use for you right now.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You are all contaminants to this era. Rather, you&#39;re an excess. I&#39;d go so far as to say you&#39;re unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Uruk is mine to protect. I do not need help from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The heavens may fall and the earth may split, but this audience will be the last time I speak to you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Listen. Do not think that you can beat those goddesses with the pathetic pawns you possess.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Forgive me for interrupting your pleasant chat, my king!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Does this look like a pleasant chat to you!? Are you blind!?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Huh? Oh, uh...We just heard your laughter echoing throughout the ziggurat, and assumed you were having a good time...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool! Don&#39;t you know that, at a certain age, one can laugh at the drop of a hat? ...No matter. What is it?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> A message from our observation post near the Tigris!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> They&#39;ve sighted the wake from the Boat of Heaven in the sky! It&#39;s heading for Uruk at high speed!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> It&#39;s Ishtar—one of the Three Goddess Alliance members!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> (Sigh) That fool again? Does she never learn?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Or is she so stupid she can&#39;t even remember what happened a day ago? No, I doubt that moron can even manage to remember what happened 12 hours ago!</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> ...Ahem. Your Majesty, please refrain from insulting Ishtar.</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> She is the patron deity of our city. Even as king, you shouldn&#39;t blaspheme against her so carelessly.</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> When you speak of her like that here, it makes matters difficult for the Sacred Temple...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Don&#39;t concern yourself with such matters! Has she ever protected the Uruks from anything?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She destroys things that don&#39;t need to be destroyed, and creates things that don&#39;t need to be created!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She&#39;s a cross between a horde of locusts, a sandstorm, and a child&#39;s tantrum!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She&#39;s probably going to accidentally destroy Eanna–her own home–again, and then run crying to An!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph. Of course, An vanished long ago. Even her father&#39;s given up on her. She got what she had coming!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That girl&#39;s going to end up all alone, crying and crying until she finally dies of exhaustion! Fwahahaha! Revolting!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> WHAT DID YOU SAY?!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This girl just destroyed the ceiling!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She came down from the sky, Your Majesty!</p><hr><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Is that Ishtar...!? Retreat! Everyone, retreat! She&#39;s gonna smite us!</p><p><strong>High Priestess:</strong><br> Emergency! Priests, prepare the special prayers! You are permitted to use them on our patron goddess!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d head straight for the throne room. You&#39;re like a gossip-loving city girl.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai, His Majesty is making “Shoo, shoo! ” motions with his hand and looking genuinely annoyed! )</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re the one who&#39;s acting like a brat! I&#39;ve had enough of you insulting me behind my back! Now I&#39;m mad!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I was planning on killing you slowly and elegantly to make you suffer, but I&#39;ve changed my mind!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re going to pay for all these years of making a mockery of a goddess! Now diiiiiie!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Ishtar is readying her heavenly bow! Good luck, my king! We&#39;re retreating!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What, you&#39;re not going to watch? No need to be so humble. This is your chance to see the mythological sight of a nasty young goddess meeting her end!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> No, it wouldn&#39;t be worth getting cursed for generations just for having watched! Good luck!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Humph. Hilarious. Even your soldiers have abandoned you! That&#39;s what you get. Your bad deeds finally caught up with you! Your deeeeeeds!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see...When I hear that from you, it really makes me think.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This cretin is calling ME the worst. Huh, perhaps I should look back on my life and reflect a bit.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Excuse you! I&#39;m a damn goddess! Rethink your words!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard to believe that a king and goddess are exchanging insults like that.... Huh? But Senpai, isn&#39;t that girl...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. It&#39;s that weird girl!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yup. It&#39;s that girl with the unimpressive chest.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Who just said that even more rude thing...!? ...Wait, I know you, human...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh? Have you run into this goddess before? Oh? Oh? And it seems she ran into trouble.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahahahahahahaha! Hilarious. Another tale of glory to add to Ishtar&#39;s myths, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hello again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess we ARE taking this to court...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re waving at me and saying hi like we&#39;re friends? You don&#39;t understand the situation at all, do you? ♡</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That means I can do this with no regrets. You&#39;ve destroyed the last of my conscience.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want weird rumors going around, so I&#39;ll kill both you and Goldie Boy over there!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Bwahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Excellent! Now this is getting fun! For a brief while, I shall permit you to fight alongside me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Chaldeans! Time to slay a goddess!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Let&#39;s teach this wanton, spoiled, daddy&#39;s girl of a goddess a lesson!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Tsk...! Spoiled as you are, you&#39;re still a goddess! Regular magecraft won&#39;t even graze you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And what&#39;s more, you&#39;re holding back your Authority! There&#39;s a limit to my patience, Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Right back at you!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I hold back my Authority for the sake of Uruk, not because I&#39;m considering your safety!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh. Now I&#39;m even pissing myself off.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Why should I care about Uruk when it&#39;s not even mine anymore?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Okay, I don&#39;t care anymore! I&#39;ll blow you up along with the ziggurat—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Hm? You there, human. Who&#39;s that hiding behind you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Behind me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s only Ana here...</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s what&#39;s going on. Things are getting complicated.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar is rising! Is she...retreating?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I changed my mind. I only came to pick up my pillow for my bedchamber in Eanna anyway.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Astonishing. Ishtar, of all goddesses, is running away with her tail between her legs?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What are you talking about? I just dropped by while I was out for a stroll.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I freely overlook Uruk, freely pluck my bow, and freely ravage the lands.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> See you, oh shirtless King of Uruk. Have fun with the Demonic Beasts up north.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And Siduri. When Gilgamesh dies, it&#39;s not like I won&#39;t save Uruk, so keep a white flag ready.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> A white flag? What do you mean...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Tch...She&#39;s cooled down. What an annoyingly lucky woman.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just a little more and I would&#39;ve had the anti-Ishtar net launched...Curses.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> It seems so. As long as Maanna, the Boat of Heaven, is around, it will be difficult to capture Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well, fine, let&#39;s get back to work. We&#39;ve lost a lot of time. Let&#39;s work harder, Siduri.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Yes. We shall resume planning to flood the Tigris River.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> There has been a suggestion that we use red clay as new soil—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;ve restarted their work as if nothing happened...What should we do, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ishtar&#39;s attacks must be a daily thing. The soldiers took their time about coming back.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmmm, there&#39;s not much we could do now. Let&#39;s go find a place to stay for tonight.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The king is moody, so maybe he&#39;ll listen to you guys tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I will not, you nitwit. Uruk is in unprecedented danger. I&#39;ve no time to deal with your Chaldean field trip.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s quite a burn.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> These guys have already corrected several Singularities; they&#39;re practically professionals at restoring history.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you a bit overworked? Why don&#39;t you try trusting a third party for once?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need. Any disaster caused in this era will be solved by the people of this era.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If they are needed, they&#39;ll be brought in later. And Merlin, remember who you are contracted to.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m the one who summoned you, not Chaldea. As such, you should be working only for me.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Err...It hurts me to hear that. Ah well, it&#39;s not as if I have much of a heart anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, did you just let some important information slip!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You weren&#39;t summoned by the Ritual Sect, but by King Gilgamesh!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh. I thought that was what I said. Yes, Gilgamesh is a wise king. He shed his warrior persona to become a mage instead.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> To protect Uruk, nay, the Mesopotamian world, he sheds his holy blood as a mage,</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He has become a more reasonable, regal, reliable version of King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Unwillingly, that is. I can&#39;t fix this disaster with my strength alone.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I must protect my people, borders, and our way of life...I must fight with all of Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That is why I locked away my treasures and took up a staff. Summoning that half-blood mage there was also part of the plan.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This is the real Heroic Spirit summon, unlike the summons of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Really...Well, now I&#39;ve lost a bit of confidence...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if you&#39;re an ancient king, to be able to summon Heroic Spirits that easily is so...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;d probably help to mention that this is the end of the Age of Gods. Summoning is much easier here than in your time.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now, if we were in the 21st century, with magecraft diminishing, even the king or I wouldn&#39;t find it easy to summon a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So there you have it. Your actions are utterly arrogant,</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> but that summoning system was created with talent equal to godly skill. I will not mock the effort, research, and miracles put towards it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That, and the shred of hope it offered you. Humph—You have done well in the first six Singularities.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The king complimented us!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, those eras are not this one. I do not need you all.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If you still say you want to assist me, you may do so by working your way up from the bottom.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> High Priestess! I put you in charge of them! It may be a pain, but take care of them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So, we&#39;ve been driven out of the ziggurat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What shall we do now, Master...?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Do not worry. I shall oversee your stay here for the time being.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Ah, where are my manners? I am Siduri.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> I assist the king as well as manage the Ritual Sect.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Siduri! By the way, a white flag means surrender.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Oh...How embarrassing. So you noticed. I didn&#39;t understand what Ishtar meant by that earlier...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> A white flag...I see. So it is a sign of surrender in your country...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...You may perhaps be from the same country as the girl who became Ishtar&#39;s vessel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m . Pleased to meet you.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> I&#39;m pleased to meet you too. We welcome you all, guests from Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I never imagined Ms. Siduri would be taking care of Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This means my work here is maybe done? Yup, that would help me out so much!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now I have time to peruse the markets! I heard Uruk&#39;s ale is to die for!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...Huh. I am sure you know already, but Merlin here will not be of much use to you.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Therefore, I shall give you some advice.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> The king has said you are not needed. However, he did not use the words “worthless” or “meaningless. ”</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Therefore, if you would like for the king to listen, having some noteworthy achievements would be helpful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When you say “achievements”...Do you mean the Demonic Front? Like defeating the beasts that threaten Uruk?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> No, that would be the soldiers&#39; job. For you...Let&#39;s see.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Go and help with the various jobs in the city. I believe the king would want that.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> So, basically you&#39;d be a jack-of-all-trades. I will go and make the job arrangements for you.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> First, I shall guide you to your private lodge. Please come with me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, um...Why would you go that far for us?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Setting aside King Gilgamesh&#39;s opinion, I&#39;m sure we are suspicious foreigners to you.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Because the king ordered me to take care of you. It&#39;s not often he says something like that.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> I cannot understand yet, but you must be worth at least that much to him.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Therefore, as his assistant, I shall trust in his word.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Please lead a righteous life, one even an incompetent being like me would be able to understand. That shall be my reward as well.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> That is how this country runs. We don&#39;t have many resources, so there isn&#39;t much in the way of entertainment.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> For Uruk, ale, sheep, and people&#39;s smiles are what give everyone the energy to survive.</p><h2 id="section-4-hardworking-citizens-of-uruk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-hardworking-citizens-of-uruk" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: Hardworking Citizens of Uruk</h2><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> This is where you&#39;ll be staying. It&#39;s old, but it should be sufficient for your needs.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> It was originally used as a tavern. The first floor is a shared space, and the rooms are on the second and third floors.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d lend us a whole building! Thank you, Siduri!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t this great, Master? Three days after our Rayshift and we already have a home to call our own!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah...But we&#39;ve gotta work to earn rent...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. We don&#39;t charge rent. We&#39;ll also provide you with the basic essentials.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My dream home has a white picket fence and pool.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;ve got good taste! That&#39;s my dream, too! A happy home just like that!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But by the time I had more than 50 of those homes, they definitely weren&#39;t happy anymore!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, dofooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And it&#39;s also the ideal place to set up a summoning circle. I imagine this is going to be your base this time,Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the Chaldean Embassy! We can all live here: Senpai, Merlin, Ana, Fou...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A hideout for the four of us, including Lady Mash, plus one beast.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm. I have a room in the ziggurat, but this place looks more fun.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go take a look at the second floor. This may be a short stay, but it&#39;s important to choose rooms.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you go look too, Ana?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...No, it&#39;s fine...I&#39;m fine anywhere as long as I have a place to sleep...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...All right. It&#39;s unsettling to be stared at, so I&#39;ll go look.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I need to watch over Merlin anyway. He has too many secrets...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t look happy.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s not it. It&#39;s just frustrating that I&#39;m getting further away from my goal.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll go check on Merlin. I need to monitor him to make sure he doesn&#39;t do anything funny.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So they both went upstairs, huh? Let&#39;s get our work done, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, get the circle ready. It&#39;ll make navigation a little easier, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right. Deploying Round Table. Anchoring Leyline coordinates!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay, is that my cue?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s time for your circle setup mini-lecture. In this episode of magecraft trivia, we&#39;ll cover...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The Age of Gods and Divine Spirits. Since you&#39;re in the B. C. period known as the end of the Age of Gods, it&#39;s the perfect subject.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I told you about Divine Spirits before, so this time, let&#39;s talk about the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mages call the magical energy that fills the atmosphere “mana. ” The further back in time you go, the more of it there is.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Think of it as the magical energy of the Earth itself. It was not unlike an infinite supply of gasoline for humans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> On the other hand, the individual magical energy possessed by a human or Heroic Spirit is called “od. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This magical energy comes from special nerve tissue called a magical circuit. Remember, though: The difference in scale between od in a human and the earth&#39;s mana is tremendous.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mana is a vast reservoir of energy, and od is just a tiny little drop.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And since the start of the A. D. era, the amount of mana has been steadily decreasing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As a result, in the 21st century, mages practice their Mystics using od alone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ll skip over why there&#39;s less mana for now. It&#39;s got to do with the Isle of Britain, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll come up eventually.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, in the Age of Gods, mana was everywhere. And there wasn&#39;t just more of it; it was more potent, too.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mana in the A. D. era is called Ether, the Fifth Imaginary Element. It&#39;s artificial magical energy, you see.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Before the A. D. era, human civilization was still in development, and magical energy was called something else:</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> True Ether. The power that gave birth to planets and formed the stars. The True Fifth Element.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This True Ether is the root that forms the gods.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t humans who ruled this era. It was the gods. Or, you could call them “nature” or “concepts” if you like.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Gods in the sky. Gods on the earth. Gods in the sea. Love was a god, hate was a god. Death and battle also had gods.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The laws of nature were among the many Authorities wielded by the gods.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The world belonged to them. You could even say the gods formed many aspects of this world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There are differing opinions as to whether the gods spoken of in legends, faiths, and religions in the modern world are the same beings...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But modern mages, at least, believe that many legends are interpretations of things that took place during the Age of Gods.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The gods truly existed. However...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> With the arrival of the Age of Man, they vanished.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> These disappearances came in three stages: decline, parting, and opportunity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The “opportunity” phase took place around the 7th century B. C.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A great disaster around 14,000 years ago supposedly caused prehistoric mythological civilizations to weaken, hence the “decline” phase.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;re in 2600 B. C. , the “parting” phase at the end of the Age of Gods, when gods and humans went their separate ways.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Mesopotamia is no exception. As it happens, the Mesopotamian gods came up with their own way...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...of trying to continue the Age of Gods, but a single king ruined their plans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A king created to bind man and the gods together. Part-man, part-god. The man they hoped would be the “Wedge of the Heavens. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But instead, he chose a path opposite to the one the gods had laid out for him. He chose to distance himself from the gods.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Gilgamesh&#39;s rebellion caused the gods of Mesopotamia to gradually lose their power, and in time they vanished from the surface of the earth.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even in this era, the gods are gone. They&#39;ve fulfilled their role and vanished.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The present theory is that they exist as hollow Divine Spirits on a higher plane, watching over the world.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The true gods have vanished from this world, leaving behind only shadows.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> In a thousand years, those shadows will be gone, replaced in the minds of humans only by legends.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I thought you wouldn&#39;t run into any living gods. I was shocked to see you&#39;d found an alliance of goddesses.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> From the data I just saw, Ishtar&#39;s Spirit Origin was extremely close to the real thing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A god&#39;s Authority is a Mystic far beyond magecraft. You could call it a manifestation of omnipotence.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;re not sure who your true foe is in that era, but it&#39;s clear that the goddesses aren&#39;t on your side.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Be careful, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I know I&#39;m wasting my time saying this, but don&#39;t do anything too crazy, okay?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Did everyone get some ale? Fujimaru and Mash are minors, so they can have fruit water.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;d prefer water too...Ale is so bitter...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Oh, how thoughtless of me. I heard you were a Servant, so I didn&#39;t think about it.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> How about this milk instead? It&#39;s got honey in it, so it&#39;s sweet.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t like sweet things either, but...Okay. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Okay everyone...I&#39;d like to have a quick toast to celebrate Fujimaru&#39;s new job with the Uruks!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Ready, everyone? ...Cheers! (Glug glug glug)</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Cheers! (Glugglug glug) Wow, that&#39;s good stuff! Especially after half a day of cleaning!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hard work is the best way to make booze taste good! I live for this kind of thing!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...This is delicious...Ah...I don&#39;t like sweet stuff...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...And Merlin took the corner room. It&#39;s not fair...If I get a chance, I think I&#39;ll murder him...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Cheers! Senpai, this fish is very good!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They say it was caught in the river, but it doesn&#39;t taste muddy...In fact, it&#39;s quite firm—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, this lamb is nice and juicy, too!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How did they flavor it without spices? So mysterious! My curiosity may never be satisfied!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re enjoying yourself, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! And it&#39;s all because...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Fate must have brought us together again,Lord Fujimaru. Here, have a drink.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru, you mustn&#39;t go pouring ale for Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> And I think you should limit your own drinking as well. Just like your sense of taste, you cannot handle liquor very well.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Do not tell me you&#39;ve forgotten how you embarrassed yourself on the bridge in Uruk yesterday. Hah hah hah!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t quite jump over eight ships. More like six? Or maybe five?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> You did a somersault into a big jump, and then landed so hard you split the bridge in two. Hah hah hah! That was crazy! Hah hah hah!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Fine. Sit down, turn away from me, and stare at your feet, Benkei. I&#39;ve heard your warning.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> By the way, you never seem to stop talking. Is it because you sense your impending death?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> “I may die tonight, and so I should say everything that&#39;s on my mind. ” Is that your logic?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Perfect. I shall help you with your beheading.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> And then I pop my head down at the last second! It&#39;s a party trick I like to call “Whack-a-Benkei! ”</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahahah! Did you like that, Lord Yoshitsune? The trick is to pop your head down like a turtle! A turtle!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Why you...You have the most bizarre talents! But it was funny, so I suppose I shall forgive you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. As you can see, it&#39;s because I&#39;ve met some reliable allies.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, I guess you can call them reliable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you sure they&#39;re not “laughable”?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yup. I never imagined King Gilgamesh would summon other Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it makes sense. That explains how he&#39;s holding back the Demonic Front.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Rider Ushiwakamaru and Lancer Musashibou Benkei defeat the Demonic Beasts around Uruk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And in command of the Demonic Front is none other than—</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Siduri, I require only nutrients! Alcohol should not be enjoyed until after we&#39;ve wiped out the Demonic Beasts!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> My heart is still at the front lines! Just like the Uruks who are fighting day after day!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> But I do need to sleep. The body requires energy,</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> but the brain requires sugar and sleep. During the battle, we soldiers are a part of a massive calculation.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The load that combat places on the brain is equal to four days&#39; worth of doing your taxes. Warriors are mathematicians.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Based on experience, two hours of battle requires a 15-minute nap! REQUIRES IT!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> And yet...the younger soldiers tell me that I&#39;m the only one who can immediately fall asleep amongst a horde of Demonic Beasts and also get up right away.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> If you&#39;re tired, you sleep! And if you think, “oh crap,” you instantly wake and jam your spear into a Demonic Beast&#39;s maw!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Survival is the first thing you learn in Sparta...But these Uruk soldiers push things to the next level!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> If you fight until you die, you can&#39;t repel the enemy army. It&#39;s a waste of a young life.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Listen. If you want a motto, the motto of a defender should be, “Don&#39;t die until the fight&#39;s over! ” That&#39;s what I think!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Uweh...Hic! (Glug glug glug)</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> What!? Who poured ale into General Leonidas&#39;s cup!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Who knows? Knowing him, he probably poured it for himself accidentally.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s good medicine for him, if you ask me. He hasn&#39;t rested as much as he says he has.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The Demonic Beasts are calmer at night. Let&#39;s let him relax for the evening.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> I-I see...Maybe you&#39;re right...If you say so, Lord Ushiwakamaru, then, well...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. That wasn&#39;t a long conversation, but it told us what we need to know about the power balance between them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Has Ushiwakamaru been leading the Heroic Spirits up until now? Merlin probably tried to avoid getting assigned to such a cumbersome job.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Roman, was it? It&#39;s true that I&#39;m the representative of the Heroic Spirits right now.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But we were summoned here by the king of this land. We know naught of your Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Perhaps there&#39;s another me there among you, but please don&#39;t assume I&#39;m the same person.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Benkei, Leonidas, and I all made our contract with King Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If ever we&#39;re forced to choose between Lord Fujimaru and the king, we&#39;ll choose the king without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> However, our goal of defending this era and this city is the same as yours.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Fujimaru, humanity&#39;s last Master. You have come from a distant world to this troubled land.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What Heroic Spirit could fail to respect you for that?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We shall help you in every way possible to the best of our abilities.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Thank you, Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> No need to thank me. It is my duty as a Heroic Spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Nice to meet you, Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Nice to meet me, huh? So I guess there is no other me in Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...That is quite a shame. Am I not that well known in your era?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Good, good. Our circumstances may be different, but we&#39;re all working toward the same goal.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But, well, can I ask you something? It was King Gilgamesh who summoned you, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Then is he the only one who&#39;s providing you with magical energy right now?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Indeed. After Merlin, King Gilgamesh summoned seven of us Heroic Spirits to this land.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Now there are only four of us, but we&#39;ll talk about that another time.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> During the summoning, it was King Gilgamesh&#39;s magical energy that formed our Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> But now we maintain our own sources of energy. We eat and sleep like humans, and generate magical energy all on our own.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...So you&#39;ve incarnated, huh? Hmm, that explains it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not even the king would be able to simultaneously maintain the Spirit Origins of four Servants at once.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, he really went a bit crazy. I should never have told him about the Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Just supplying me with magical energy almost drained him dry. But then he says, “I&#39;ll summon seven more! ”</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The reason King Gilgamesh isn&#39;t on the front lines fighting is partly because he still hasn&#39;t recovered all his magical energy.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> So it seems. Before we were summoned, he said he didn&#39;t know who the enemy was.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The northern cities were wiped out by the Demonic Beasts, disasters occurred all over the land, and Kutha vanished overnight.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> That&#39;s when King Gilgamesh said he “saw” the future. He saw a future where Uruk was destroyed and swallowed up into an abyss.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That must be King Gilgamesh&#39;s clairvoyance. That&#39;s why he took the risk of summoning a Heroic Spirit...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As a king who had to deal with such a disaster, he required multiple Heroic Spirits, correct?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Excellent analysis, Mash Kyrielight...May I call you Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-yes. I&#39;m Mash Kyrielight. I&#39;m just a Demi-Servant, but nice to meet you!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The pleasure is mine. Anyway, back to the timeline.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> After this era became a Singularity, and humanity was incinerated, King Gilgamesh summoned us.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Six months later, Uruk was reborn into a fortress city.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> We grow crops, train soldiers, and build structures within the fortress...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> A monetary system was established purely as an emergency measure for the war, all while we struggle against this unknown enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s pretty amazing...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Incredible...People fought in America too, but that was only after their nation had already been destroyed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uruk is the opposite. People are fighting right now to prevent the destruction of their world in the first place.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, it was a matter of timing.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If what happened in America had come a few years later, they would&#39;ve fought the Celts head-on.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> What was lucky for Uruk was that King Gilgamesh had come back “matured. ”</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> After he finished his search for immortality, he probably underwent a bit of a mental change.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right. Speaking of his search for immortality...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was his friend Enkidu who started it all, right? So much happened that I forgot...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who was that Enkidu?</p><hr><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...I see. So you met that Enkidu, then?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh&#39;s friend, a hero equal in stature...and now humanity&#39;s enemy.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...But we just can&#39;t believe that&#39;s truly Enkidu. The Uruks knew the old Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Enkidu was the one who restrained King Gilgamesh, the king who was fated to be alone until death, and taught him the joys of friendship.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Though they insisted they were simply a tool, to me, Enkidu seemed like nothing less than a very kind person.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...The real Enkidu would never wear such a cruel smile on their face.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> That THING that threatens Sumer now must be a fake only pretending to be Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...A fake, huh? Then Enkidu is dead, like the legend says?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...Yes. The king watched as Enkidu died, and buried his friend in the underworld.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...Thinking back, there was nothing so beautiful or sad as Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> They may have been a puppet made by the gods, but they gained a heart...Granted, Enkidu was shattered along with it, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enkidu gained a heart, but was shattered along with it...That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No, for now, let&#39;s talk about King Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does the king know that...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That a fake version of his lost friend has been made into his enemy?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, of course he does. Though, the king doesn&#39;t leave the ziggurat, so he&#39;s never met them personally.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But his response was unremarkable.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> “Someone calling themselves Enkidu appeared? I see. Well, I suppose that&#39;s possible. ”</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s all he said. He didn&#39;t get angry, or sad...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> What kind of reaction is that? I&#39;ve lived a long time in the world of humans, but I can&#39;t understand it.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...Yes. It didn&#39;t feel like he was trying to keep us from worrying, either.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hahahaha! The world will come to an end before he cares about someone else&#39;s feelings.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, no matter what King Gilgamesh is thinking, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s staying calm.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The only reason Uruk is still standing at all is because of how hard the king is working.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If he ever abandoned the role of the wise king and became the King of Heroes again, Uruk would be doomed. I want to avoid that, too.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> After all, if Uruk fell, I wouldn&#39;t be able to drink its ale, or visit its brothels.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...(Nods sagely)</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...But we have to find out who the fake is.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m not telling you to forget it. We&#39;ll definitely find out who this false Enkidu is.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But that can be done tomorrow. You haven&#39;t rested since your Rayshift, right?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Get some rest tonight. We can talk and begin your new lives tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I have something to look into, so I&#39;ll be gone for a while. But while I&#39;m away you can get help from Siduri and the other Servants.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Look, Ana fell asleep too. Take care of her as well.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She told you she doesn&#39;t like humans, but she doesn&#39;t hate them either.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Actually, she&#39;s scared of them, so she&#39;s trying to keep her distance. You know what that means, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Scared of humans...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Understood. Leave it to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> All right. I&#39;ll be going, then. One of my favorite girls is waiting for me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Merlin&#39;s right, Senpai. You don&#39;t look so good. Your vitals are dropping too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It may be rude, but let&#39;s leave Ushiwakamaru and the others and get some rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Good night, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Good night, Master. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, here in the lobby of the Chaldean Embassy!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai. You must&#39;ve slept well last night.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Good...morning...Both of you are early risers...So amazing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re just swapping out the staff over here, too. Good morning, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Morning, everyone.</p><hr><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> It seems we&#39;re all here. Very well. Let me give you your assignment, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Today&#39;s task is from Mr. Limmat at the ranch. Apparently, he wants help shearing his sheep.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Shearing sheep...Shearing sheep!? That&#39;s such a menial chore!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> It isn&#39;t a menial task. Wool is priceless. It is a valuable commodity for trade.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Sheep are normally shorn two or three times a year, but the shorter the cycle, the greater the profit.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Mr. Limmat&#39;s main assets are his 180 sheep. If it takes four hours to shave one, he can only shave four a day at most.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> In other words, it would take Mr. Limmat over a month to shear all the sheep by himself.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> A whole month. If this could be shortened to 10 days, do you see how much of a difference in profit it would make?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So it&#39;s like a shipment coming in a month late...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That analogy is really the opposite, but I see what you mean...It&#39;s the age of the fast and furious, or rather, the RAST and furriest.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t survive without working?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Seems so...But being able to touch sheep...makes me a little happy.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. Leave it to us! Let&#39;s do this, Master!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> I like your enthusiasm. Now then, here is your referral letter. Sheep are nice, Mash. They are very fluffy this time of year.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So they ARE fluffy...(Gulp)This will be one tough mission...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A new challenger appears...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Give it up, Fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. I forgot to mention that the ranch is on the outskirts of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> There are reports of previously undocumented Demonic Beasts roaming that area. Please be careful.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Hey, I owe you one! I was helpless against those vermin!</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> I only expected you to keep watch as I was shearing, but I never imagined you&#39;d exterminate them...</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> I expect nothing less from the elites working directly for the king! Help me again sometime! Here&#39;s three Sheep Silver.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Huh? Don&#39;t I have sheep to shear, you ask? Well, the circumstances have changed...</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> The girls from the Sacred Temple wanted to try shearing so much so that they&#39;re willing to pay me silver for it. So the other sheep were reserved for them.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Who knew that shearing sheep would become a business unto itself...Oh brother, fads sure are weird...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The sheep...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...passed by right in front of our eyes...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Both of you, get ahold of yourselves...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, that was just horrible...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, that didn&#39;t go the way they&#39;d hoped...I have nothing to say to Mash and Ana...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Must be a side effect of the sudden introduction of a monetary system and the ability to “buy” entertainment.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It is an effective method of livening up a city, but it might be about 500 years too early...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...I believe security deposits of silver began thriving from around the Akkadian period. They didn&#39;t exist in the Early Dynastic period...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that King Gilgamesh is at fault, but perhaps it was too early for the citizens of Uruk...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I agree, Mash. The monetary system is bad civilization...Reservations are terrible...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Good morning. I guess we&#39;re heading to work at the same hour today.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Siduri, what is Lord Fujimaru&#39;s task for today?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Today&#39;s request is from Mr. Kissinamuh.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> His wife has been acting strangely for the past few days, and he&#39;d like you to investigate.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> To be blunt, you&#39;re investigating an affair.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-investigating an affair? Um...shouldn&#39;t things like that be resolved between the parties involved?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Mr. Kissinamuh is the boss at the armory. He cannot leave his workplace during the weekdays.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> But it&#39;s all weighing heavily on his mind, and it&#39;s affecting his work. An early resolution would be ideal.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Also, he needs evidence if it goes to trial. Try to catch her in the act, identify the adulterer, and look into their history.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Oh. That sounds interesting. Lord Fujimaru, may I come along with you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We are in charge of patrolling Uruk today. We shall help you out while giving you a tour of the city.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gladly!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahaha, that&#39;s the spirit! Of course, I will accompany you too.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> You should not underestimate the difficulties of investigating an affair.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> It&#39;s normal for the cornered wife to show her devilish side and retaliate by swinging around a giant hatchet when caught in the act.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> However, my Buddhist power is undiminished in a foreign land. Benkei here will exorcise them without a second thought!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Lord Fujimaru. Needless to say, you can ignore that naysayer&#39;s doom and gloom.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m understanding Uruk less and less...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right...More and more internal affairs are surfacing and pointing to a cruel world...</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Um...I won&#39;t be going with you.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> An old lady I met on the street asked for my help earlier...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, the lady from the flower shop, right? I do remember she was looking for an assistant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru and the others will help out, so we&#39;ll be fine on our end this time.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...(Bowing)</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Then, let us be on our way! First, we need to tail the wife.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Uruk is like my backyard now. You can put all your trust in me! Come along!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Th-that was quite an experience, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Yes, it was quite a case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who would&#39;ve imagined the wife was secretly a member of a mysterious species living deep underground, scheming to invade the surface world...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And who knew that there was an underground lava zone in the suburbs! What an adventure. I can&#39;t even begin to put it into words.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it was tragic, too...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Her love truly was real. And in the end, it was what saved the surface world...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fiery love is universal...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s the last of the Yohimen...</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I know. Let&#39;s advise King Gilgamesh to adjust the laws regarding relations and marital issues with other species,</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> so no one ever has to see a tragedy like this again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Speaking of laws, Mesopotamian civilization is built on the Code of Ur-Nammu and the Code of Hammurabi.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Code of Ur-Nammu was created between this era and the 3rd Dynasty of Ur.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s said that it consolidated all the nebulous rules into one code, which became humanity&#39;s oldest structured law.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. Mash, you&#39;re really well-informed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, no...I just have a smattering of knowledge. I don&#39;t know the dictates of the code in detail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Speaking of the Code of Hammurabi...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. The famous code of “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. ” You could say that&#39;s the basis for law in modern society.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> By the way. Lord Fujimaru, I hear you&#39;ve only been here for a short time.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We have been walking and eating around the city, but what about outside of Uruk?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Neither Benkei nor I are very knowledgeable about it, but we could at least tell you about the rumors.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tell me about the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, that is currently the most important issue. Ushiwakamaru, by all means, tell us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What kind of hero is Ushiwakamaru?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Uh...Me? That&#39;s a difficult one to answer when asked so bluntly.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> As you can see, I am a Japanese warrior. That said, the story of my birth is fairly complicated.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Born in the Heian period, raised in a temple, and trained by a tengu on Mt. Kurama. So I&#39;m ignorant of the world.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m a skilled swordswoman. That&#39;s all. Nothing else suited me.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I was nothing more than my big brother&#39;s blade, or perhaps nothing else interested me...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I would run around the battlefield without any special aspirations or ideals, just decapitating enemy generals.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Also, Ushiwakamaru is my childhood name.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If you were to summon me as a Minamoto–that is, when I had a position–I would probably appear different.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> She is a cold-blooded warrior who brought death upon many compatriots, and never corrected her foolishness until the very end.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m happy as “Ushiwakamaru. ” The person I am now is able to accept everything without protest.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Not having that position is what lets me be in such good spirits and talk with you like this, Lord Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> With that in mind, this fleeting life is precious to me.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I feel like I&#39;m in an innocent dream, the sort I had when I knew nothing.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Mm, Lord Fujimaru. It seems you are interested in Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> If so, talk to this humble servant in secret later on. After all, I, Musashibou Benkei, am Ushiwakamaru&#39;s best retainer.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> We are inseparable as master and servant. We are like childhood best friends.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I can tell you everything about Ushiwakamaru&#39;s matter-of-fact heroic exploits and adventures.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, I will smash that decoration (read: him) one day, so please ignore him.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m using him as a shield against arrows, but so far the chance hasn&#39;t presented itself.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahaha, you are too harsh with me. This humble servant&#39;s position has become tenuous.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Therefore, let us change the subject. Lord Fujimaru, you are investigating the Three Goddess Alliance?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, that is currently the most important issue. Ushiwakamaru, by all means, tell us.</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Needless to say, the Three Goddess Alliance is a major threat to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The Demonic Front up north. The jungle in the south. And the aerial attacks from Ishtar in the northeast mountains.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Currently, the city of Uruk is under three separate attacks from these directions.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Leonidas is keeping the Demonic Front to the north in check, but there are no countermeasures for the other two problems.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The goddess Ishtar possesses a bow called the Boat of Heaven. As the name implies, it&#39;s a divine vessel that can soar through the sky.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> She does not have the overwhelming force of the Demonic Front, but she is still a nuisance.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> She&#39;s like an unpredictable storm.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> As for the jungle in the south...We don&#39;t know anything about it yet.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh has sent out a number of scouting parties, but no one has ever returned.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> On the one hand, the Demonic Beast legion is a dynamic invasion, on the other, the jungle is a static invasion.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So all the forces invading Uruk are unique.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Three menaces...The Three Goddess Alliance...Who are these goddesses, and what do they want...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, we do know that Ishtar is one of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> According to King Gilgamesh, the goddesses&#39; objective is capturing the Holy Grail he possesses...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The Great Grail of Uruk, eh...He flaunted it in front of...I mean, he allowed me to take a look.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It did indeed look like it contained vast magical energy.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Whether it be goddess, Heroic Spirit, or human, anyone who uses that Grail could easily become king.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Do you suppose the goddesses are after the Greater Grail to re-create this world in their own image after they destroy Uruk?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Greater Grail of Uruk...? Is that what King Gilgamesh said, Ushiwaka?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, that is the name he was so proud to come up with. When I said I wanted to touch it, though, he refused quite vehemently.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hmm, a wise judgment from a wise king. Much better than handing to Lord Ushiwakamaru and having her accidentally drop it, smashing it to pieces...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Or, I could see you saying, “I like this, so I&#39;m keeping it,” and then trying to decapitate the king. Hahahaha.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Lord Roman, what&#39;s the matter? And Benkei, go sit in the corner until morning.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Oh...To recreate my standing death through sitting...The lukewarm stares from the people of Uruk are excruciating.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s nothing. Now that I think about it, it&#39;s only natural. Forget it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Greater Grail of Uruk is not this era&#39;s Holy Grail?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what it means.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> From the beginning, King Gilgamesh possessed a treasure worthy of being called a Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We mistakenly thought that was the King of Mages&#39; Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Gilgamesh and Merlin both realized that, but didn&#39;t point it out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Which is vexing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Merlin is rotten to the core, so I&#39;m sure we could never get a straight answer from him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And as for asking King Gilgamesh, he would only get furious and say, “How dare you compare my treasures to the King of Mages&#39;! ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Either way, the Holy Grail we&#39;re supposed to recover isn&#39;t in Uruk, but somewhere else, correct?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Or it could already have been used.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s a good chance of that. If you think about it, the very existence of the Three Goddess Alliance is strange.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s possible the Holy Grail was used to summon the goddesses...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe the three goddesses have it...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That would be a real pain...They&#39;re powerful opponents already, but if they also had the Holy Grail, we would be no match for them...</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Ho! Lord Fujimaru, Mash! Gooooood! Morning! Fine weather we&#39;re having again this morning!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> K-King Leonidas!? You&#39;re going out!?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Hahaha. No need to address me as king. I am a mere soldier now. Nothing more than a shield to protect Uruk.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> And today I shall be a drill sergeant from hell in the eastern barracks!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> This may be a touch juvenile for someone like myself, but I am going to take great pleasure in introducing the soldiers to the hell that is Spartan training!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Won&#39;t they die?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Hahaha. If a soldier dies from strenuous training, that only proves they lack spirit.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> And if the training is too much and they keel over? All I must do is smack some of that spirit back into their bodies, and they&#39;ll perk right up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ohhhhhh!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So the northern front is fine?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Yes. The flooding strategy at the Tigris River was successful. The Demonic Beast invasion should be weakened for a few days.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> In the meantime, we must ready our army. The armory has done an excellent job of replenishing our weapons,</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> but the quality of the soldiers is disheartening. A matter I shall handle directly!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> To make them more combat-effective, I will beat the fundaments of soldiering into them!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuu...</p><hr><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Good morning, Fujimaru and Mash. Ana, I see you&#39;re up as well.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. Something was very noisy...I thought it might have been an enemy raid...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> An enemy raid!? Rest assured, as long as Leonidas is around, Uruk will not fall!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Leonidas, was it? ...So, that&#39;s what was so loud. Well...Good work.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Today&#39;s request is actually from Leonidas.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> He mentioned that his trainees are coming along well, so he wants you to have a mock battle with 100 of them or so.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh? Um, what did you just say?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> I know how you feel. But it&#39;s best to just go along with it, really.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Indeed! Sparring with a hundred people sounds stupendous! I engaged in many such trials before my coming-of-age ceremony!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> But why such a hard task, you ask?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Lord Fujimaru, I assume you have a Spartan acquaintance?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou! (Special translation: YOU! )</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re done!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;re done!</p><hr><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> As you can see! In a spar against one hundred men, you reach your limit around sixty! But that&#39;s when the real fight begins!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Muscles that are about to give out! Hearts about to burst, your energy reserves down to zero...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I want you all to learn how to fight in such extreme conditions! Just like how Lady Mash did when she fought you all!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, sir!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Very good. Well, that&#39;s enough muscle philosophy. We&#39;ll be talking about brains next.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> It&#39;s common sense that you would be strong when you&#39;re energized. After all, a body in peak condition can do anything.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> But once the battle starts, you start to drop from your “best condition” with each passing second.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> So instead of trying to maintain your best condition, I want you to learn how to balance it with your “worst condition. ”</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The tenacity you get when you&#39;re in that state of fatigue reigns supreme. What can you do when you can&#39;t do anything?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Understanding that alone boosts your survival rate. The limits of your stamina are much like waves breaking upon the shore...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be able to fight again if you can get over the peak of your fatigue! Do not forget: fatigue is not a bad thing!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Y-yeah...? Uh, okay. Yes, sir!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Illness comes from the spirit. I say that you see ghosts when you are weak-spirited. But being wounded is bad. It&#39;s BAD.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> If you&#39;re wounded, you need to switch out with someone else immediately. Fighting spirit doesn&#39;t heal wounds!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Fatigue and injury are separate issues. Understand? Now for lesson two!!!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Toss away your spear, but not your shield!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Any spear will do, but a shield is special! You&#39;ll never find another one like yours!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> You must find the best shield for yourself! There is no shield superior to the round shield!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Huh? Uh, I suppose he&#39;s right. Yeaaaah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Leonidas&#39;s class has started!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m completely exhausted, but I&#39;m going to participate to learn more. There we go...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, please rest here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I, Mash Kyrielight, shall return as a slightly better Shielder!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> See yoooooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t push yourself too hard...</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Are you tired too, Fujimaru? You look like you can&#39;t move anymore...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. Ana&#39;s a Rogue Servant; she doesn&#39;t have a Master.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Servants that have contracted with a Master can draw most of their magical energy from him or her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It is the Master who determines a Servant&#39;s possible energy output and how long they can fight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course, a Servant can fight with the magical energy they generate themselves, but that would make them no different from a Shadow Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A Servant will only truly shine after they&#39;ve contracted with a Master. They can be even more powerful if the bond is a strong and intimate one.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I see...I was in the Cedar Forest this whole time, so I didn&#39;t know...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You don&#39;t know anything about being a Servant?</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...No. When I came to I was in the forest, and in this body. I had no knowledge about being a Servant.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...But I knew just what I had to do. I had to kill those Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I was killing them all alone, and using their souls to maintain my Spirit Origin...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do you want to contract with me?</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...No, that&#39;s fine. Please don&#39;t misunderstand.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I&#39;m here because of your hostilities with the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...You will, without doubt, fight them at the Northern Wall. Merlin said so.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m just waiting for that moment.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Whatever happens to humanity is none of my concern...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ana...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Heeey!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m back from cleaning the river!</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Oh, good work. Come in. It&#39;s almost time for dinner.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, welcome back, Lord Fujimaru. You were cleaning the city river today?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I was getting rid of troublesome birds. It&#39;s fine that they fly from roof to roof, but birds are pretty smart nowadays.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> They fly low through the main street, and I ended up damaging a total of four shops, including fruit shops and flower shops.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahh, that&#39;s why King Gilgamesh looked so sullen.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He said: “I was the one who told you to come report the day&#39;s work, yes, but I didn&#39;t tell you to come back with complaints! ”</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Can&#39;t be helped. Sacrifices had to be made. I imagine restitution is going to come out of Benkei&#39;s wages anyway...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> That was another good day of training! The men are almost full-fledged soldiers!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Oh, how rare to see everyone here at once. Am I sitting here? Much thanks.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...By the way, who&#39;s on dinner duty today? If it&#39;s Ana, I think I just remembered something I have to do...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m on dinner duty today.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> The neighbors kindly lent me their oven, so I made a butter cake.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Butter cake...! You mean the dessert you need ten Priestess Silver pieces to buy? THAT butter cake?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> That&#39;s the one. It is one of the best desserts.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> No need to pay for the ingredients. Please have as much as you wish.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s delicious. Can I save a piece for later?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Of course. But please eat it before lunch tomorrow. It will go bad, otherwise.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Much obliged, Lady Siduri. However, since you&#39;re the High Priestess, is it really okay for you to visit us every day?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. The king has ordered me to do so. I act as an aide to His Majesty during the day, so please, do not worry.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Oh, and all the clay tablets over there are tokens of gratitude from the citizens of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Take a look at them when you get a chance. This is our way of repaying you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm...A homemade meal from Siduri? Don&#39;t mind if I do.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hey, good evening. It&#39;s been a while, everyone! Hmm? Want me to listen to your report?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for that. Most of the time I just stayed in the house and didn&#39;t do anything.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I know very well what kind of work Fujimaru had to do.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah, this is kind of...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Are we in a dorm?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know, right? This is supposed to be the last Singularity threatening humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But we&#39;ve got so many people living under the same roof. No wonder it&#39;s turned into “Keeping Up with the Chaldeans. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s important for you to get used to life in Uruk. It&#39;ll only help you to know how people lived in this era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can kick and scream all you want, but a battle is inevitable. Why not loosen up and have some fun for the time being?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good point.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you think about it, moments like these are hard to come by. The Heroic Spirits present aren&#39;t normal Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They are all working to protect Uruk like the people living in this era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a deeper relationship with human history that doesn&#39;t exist in Chaldea. Miracles like this don&#39;t come by very often.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you sad that you can&#39;t join us, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, I suppose so. Siduri&#39;s food looks really good too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But I have yet another all-night dinner party with the Chaldea staff.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It feels like I&#39;m living in a dorm here every day. So I don&#39;t feel lonely at all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, don&#39;t worry about me. Have fun with everyone while you can.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s what&#39;s best for Chaldea, too. Like they say, there&#39;s the right man for every job.</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Good morning, Fujimaru. Thanks for heading out to work so early.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Merlin. Are you heading out?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No, I was out all night and just got back. I wanted to head straight to my room, but I needed to talk to you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s been 20 days. Have you gotten used to life here in Uruk?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fortunately, yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s actually pretty fun here.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Good. That&#39;s evidence you&#39;re a creature who adapts well.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Humans have beautiful and amazing dreams because they enjoy everything they see.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But unfortunately, I do have some bad news. Here&#39;s a message from Siduri:</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> “No requests today. Please use this day off to enjoy Uruk. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A day off...? That&#39;s good, but...It is a bit disappointing, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was excited to see what work we&#39;d get today.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> A...day off work...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well...I&#39;ll be taking my leave. Oh, but this is a good chance. Why not take Mash on a date?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a secret rendezvous you want, I recommend the gardens in front of Eanna. Since it&#39;s Ishtar&#39;s bedroom, it has a fantastic variety of flowers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Merlin headed for the second floor.... Well, what do you think, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess we have to go on that date.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For the good of the mission, we must go on a date.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Excuse me. Do the both of you have a spare moment?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> If so, I have a job I&#39;d like to ask you to do.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Here&#39;s all the silver I&#39;ve managed to save up. I&#39;ve exchanged it for King&#39;s Silver. I have seven.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Would that be enough to have you accompany me for the day?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. We couldn&#39;t turn down a request from you, Ana. Payment isn&#39;t necessary either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Senpai? We were just looking for some work worth doing!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash is right. Leave it to us, Ana.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Then I&#39;ll take you to the site. We&#39;ll have to fight, so I&#39;ll be counting on you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Fight...?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fouuu?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Good work. I think we&#39;ve defeated all the evil spirits around here...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> If I were alone, some might have gotten away...Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was surprised there was a cave underneath Uruk, but those spirits were every bit as shocking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ana, do you know what those spirits were?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not sure, but they are like grim reapers...I think.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> You two may not have noticed, but a deadly disease is spreading in Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Starting with the weak ones, people fall into an eternal slumber. Those spirits must be connected to that somehow.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Which is why I thought getting rid of them might reduce the death toll...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. In the Age of Gods, physical death is different than spiritual death.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if the body&#39;s fine, if the soul is taken away by a grim reaper then it means death for that human.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.... Except having the soul taken away is not quite “death. ” It is more like being asleep.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> As long as the body is safe, returning a person&#39;s soul will wake them up.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> In the Age of Gods, “bringing the dead back from Kur” is simply a type of medical treatment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Even if your heart stops, you can come back as long as your body is preserved...Is that what you mean?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Yes. But, a person cannot be revived if their soul is destroyed before it reaches Kur.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> In that case, the body will share the same fate as the soul. It will shut down and eventually return to the earth.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hm. A “life after death” sounds very Age of Gods-y. That must be one reason why the quality of the mana is different here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So going to the underworld itself doesn&#39;t equal death. “Death” is the “nothingness” that awaits beyond Kur, beyond the underworld.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...In Uruk, that nothingness is called the Abyss.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Whatever it is, the spirits from Kur are like kidnappers that steal the souls of the living.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> There seemed to be many here, so...um, I had you help me to get rid of them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How did you find out about these spirits?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Because...there were so many gathered above the flower shop on the main street...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You did this for the people of Uruk?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...No. They were simply an eyesore.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Anyhow, we have defeated all the spirits. I will go and report to Siduri. Please excuse me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, wait, Ana! I&#39;ll go with you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, please head back without me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think Ana will be able to properly explain to Siduri on her own!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re all by ourselves now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go back to the embassy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian A:</strong><br> ...Who&#39;s that old man? He&#39;s not from around here, is he?</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian B:</strong><br> Goodness, a beggar...His leg is so...He&#39;s not even an injured soldier either...</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian C:</strong><br> Just leave him. The caretakers will probably come soon. That&#39;s what the Sacred Temple&#39;s budget&#39;s for.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian D:</strong><br> That&#39;s true...But he hasn&#39;t moved at all from that spot...I don&#39;t think he&#39;s eaten for at least two days.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou. Fou, foou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know. Wait right here, Fou.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I know I had some Wheat Silver left over...</p><hr><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Quietly leaves some bread. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s not much, but please have some.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Halt.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Um, uhh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Did I do something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> ...Indeed. Hear me, and attend.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Child, remember this: Pity betimes can be a crime unto itself.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Void of purpose, compassion to evil is twisted. So, too, with shame.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> ...However, &#39;tis naught but the bitterness of age that scorns kindness thoughtfully given.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Your insight, child, impresses me. Your gift was not mere money, but that which was most needed.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> I shall gladly accept it.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fofou!? (Translation: But you&#39;re not gonna eat it!? )</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> ...Hm. Having accepted your charity, I must offer recompense.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Ziusu-dra, I am called. As you see, I am no more than an old man bereft of a future.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> However, child, a future may yet be yours. So to you, counsel is greater than any coin.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Heed me, child. Three storms will soon sweep over Uruk.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Empathize not with the hateful one. Celebrate not with the joyous one.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> ...And extol not the pained one.</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Remember, always. In defiance of your purpose it may be, but &#39;tis a fool&#39;s task to set man &#39;gainst god.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who ARE you...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Three storms...?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s gone...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What was that about...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou...</p><h2 id="section-5-welcome-to-the-jungle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-welcome-to-the-jungle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Welcome to the Jungle</h2><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> —on&#39;t go—</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> —Don&#39;t go—</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> —on&#39;t leave—</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> —Don&#39;t leave me—</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> —alone again—</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> —Don&#39;t leave me again—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is...?</p><hr><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Come back...Come back...Once more to me...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Once more...Just once more...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> No...No...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Never again...Ever...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> ...love...me...again...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is this...?</p><hr><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> ...It is original sin. This is mankind&#39;s original sin.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> There are different kinds of sin. To harm others. To deceive others. To envy others. To take the lives of others.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> These are all evils that mankind holds. These are all toxins that affect only mankind.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> However...This is the oldest evil of them all. The Original Sin II...the sin of parting from ■, and leaving paradise.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aah, but...</p><hr><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Life was born from the sea. The primeval sea, Nammu, the goddess of the beginning.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> To mankind, the goddess is the sea itself. The roaring of the waves became a voice to expose your sins.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Never forget that.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> That voice is your original sin. This name shall become your savior.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> That name is—</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Aa, Aa...Aaaaaaaaaa—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How sad...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That concludes our report. We couldn&#39;t shear the sheep and we ended up having to eradicate the surrounding Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. How boring. What&#39;s the matter, High Priestess? Do not stop reporting. Don&#39;t mind them.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There was evidence of a summoning at the altar of Eanna? As I expected. Ask those who were working at the time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> A ritual of that scale must have required them to clear some people out ahead of time. Look for people who were suddenly given days off, that will be your lead.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And that concludes our report. We were supposed to help make some sweets and it somehow turned into the Great Uruk Dessert Championship.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...How does that happen? I don&#39;t understand...You, soldier...What do you want? Don&#39;t waste my time!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Tch! ...So even Ugallu has appeared...At this point, all of the Offspring of Tiamat have been spotted.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Send 200 more units of firewood to the Northern Wall. The poisonous dragon, Bašmu, will soon appear there. Boil water and be thorough with the sterilization.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and that concludes our report. The investigation of an affair somehow ended up in a deadly underground revolt...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...(Gulp).</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh. I was in the middle of my report. Would you focus over here please?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmm? I&#39;ve heard your report, Siduri! Close the books! You just interrupted the best part!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Give her the Belt of Nidaba from my treasury! It&#39;ll be more than enough for the Temple Matron of Eresh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And that concludes our report. Senpai solved the argument over the rising prices of mutton and milk with a single remark:</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> “Let them eat beans. ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Wait, you&#39;re saying that was all it took!? How are beans better than mutton!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hah...Don&#39;t tell me...you sold those beans and told them to pair it with ale!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s no good! It&#39;s too early for Uruk! We can&#39;t have people enslaved, working only for beans!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...King Gilgamesh. Reports are building up, so let us return to the matter at hand.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...I see. You are right. Fine, continue. Chaldeans, you may leave now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, now for today&#39;s report...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh is a busy person, so let&#39;s make it quick for him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, he&#39;s still scary, as always.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s becoming sort of fun though.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...And that concludes our report.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We shall take our leave, King Gilgamesh. We&#39;re sorry to have taken up your time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...No. Wait a moment, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Did he just...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Did he just say my name?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What of it? If your name is worth uttering, then it&#39;s only natural for me to do so.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;ve made quite a bit of progress. I&#39;ve been hearing many comments from the citizens of Uruk about your work.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Your work was not that interesting. However, I must take public opinion into consideration as well.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fujimaru of Chaldea. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re getting bored of all the petty tasks now.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I shall grant you a pass to go outside of Uruk. Spread your wings a little.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Does that mean...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, it&#39;s a direct order from me. You should feel honored, mongrel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My king, more details please!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m not your king! I&#39;m Uruk&#39;s king!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh, wait, I suppose it&#39;s the same now. Insolent fool, how dare you make me correct myself on such a trivial matter!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ask Merlin for the details. I expect good...No, I expect an amusing report from you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Merlin, we did it! We&#39;ve gotten a direct order from King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, congratulations you two. Even I didn&#39;t expect the king to give in so soon.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You will head to the city of Ur in the south. Your objective is to investigate the forest from which no one has yet returned.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I wanted to lie around and do nothing a bit longer, but I suppose there&#39;s no choice but to go.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s time to move the pawn forward.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Lord Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I heard from Lady Siduri! How wonderful! I feel just like when Emperor Go-Shirakawa awarded me my titles!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Yes, truly! However, Lord Ushiwakamaru, that is not a very auspicious example.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you, both of you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t tell Leonidas now, but I will let him know when we come back!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Not only that, you&#39;re going to investigate Ur. Argh...I would&#39;ve been able to accompany you yesterday...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> But I&#39;ve received word from Lord Leonidas that something&#39;s happened at the Demonic Front so I should hurry over there. Truly unfortunate.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...All right! Benkei, let&#39;s do the thing! To congratulate Fujimaru&#39;s promotion and to wish for their safety!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Oh, that! Well then, Lord Fujimaru and Lady Mash! Head outside!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru, why is your sword drawn!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Benkei, why are you rattling your spear!?</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Fwahahaha! The two of us shall wish for the safety and success of your trip!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Come, it&#39;s just a practice battle to get you fired up!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We&#39;re definitely not thinking of defeating you to trade jobs and head to Ur ourselves, so do not worry!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is completely ridiculous, Master, but I guess we have to! Let&#39;s fight as a quick warm-up!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Splendid! With those skills, you shall win the day no matter what awaits you in Ur.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Indeed. We are most reassured now in sending you off.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> However, please do be careful. It isn&#39;t just soldiers that haven&#39;t returned after heading into that jungle.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Two other Heroic Spirits King Gilgamesh summoned, Amakusa Shirou and Fuuma Kotarou, have not returned either.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Lord Amakusa and Lord Kotarou, huh...I had thought perhaps the Twin Arm Brigade would, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The king had summoned others!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So many Servants from Japan...</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Exactly. The oni Ibaraki and Tomoe Gozen were here, too. Ibaraki broke off and disappeared somewhere,</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> but Tomoe Gozen faced Girtablilu, the general of the Demonic Beasts, and they took each other out...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ibaraki was mouthing off, saying she was going to organize a bandit group in this era, so I scared her and she ran off.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> As soon as I find her, as part of the Minamoto clan, I shall take responsibility in lopping her head off.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Though, since we&#39;re talking about that oni, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s doing nothing more than fuming in some ruins.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A lot of things happened, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ibaraki-Douji...I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever meet...</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Are you done with your goodbyes? We&#39;ll be on our way soon. Ready?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, yes! We&#39;ll be right there!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru, Benkei, thank you very much. We gratefully accept your parting words.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Likewise. Growing up in the mountains, I could only provide a boorish celebration. But it was a good, fulfilling battle.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We eagerly await your return. While you are gone, leave the protection of Uruk to us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you. We&#39;ll be on our way!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Even Mušmaḫḫū has appeared...The number of Demonic Beasts from the north just keeps on increasing...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah. If that many of the Eleven Offspring have shown up...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Soon you&#39;ll start hearing people claiming the Goddess of Demonic Beasts is the same as Tiamat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The Eleven Offspring?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> According to the Mesopotamian creation myth, they are the last children of Tiamat, the mother of all gods.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tiamat...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A goddess of creation in the world of Mesopotamia...It is said she&#39;s the mother who gave birth to all the gods.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Tiamat is one of the primordial gods of Mesopotamia. Or perhaps she should be considered a first-generation god.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In Mesopotamian mythology, the universe is called Anki. “An” means “heaven and god” and “Ki” means “earth and goddess. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The goddess brings forth life, and the god rules it. That&#39;s how the relationship is.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Back when what was above was not called heaven and what was beneath was not called earth,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> the god Abzu mated with the goddess Tiamat, and gave birth to many children, the gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But as the children grew, they desired power, and they rebelled against Tiamat to widen the world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Tiamat was saddened and angered by her children&#39;s betrayal, and created new children.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But they were only “Ki,” incomplete creations that lacked “An. ” As a result, these new children were not gods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Instead, they were twisted, terrifying beasts...The “Eleven Offspring of Tiamat. ”</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The seven-headed serpents known as the Mušmaḫḫū. The wicked water snakes known as the Ušumgallu.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Dragon-beast Bašmu, the poison snake. Babylon&#39;s Dragon Mušḫuššu, the terrifying snake.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Two-faced beast Laḫmu, the mysterious child. There&#39;s no description of its form in the books, so I can&#39;t tell you more.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Giant Beast Ugallu, the giant sun. The lion-dog Uridimmu.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Girtablilu the Wise, the scorpion man. Until three months ago, it was the commander of the Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Tomoe Gozen sacrificed herself to slay Girtablilu. It&#39;s thanks to her that our battle lines still hold.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Evil spirits Umū Dabrūtu, the fierce storm. The winged mermaid Kulullû.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Lastly, Minotaur Kusarikku, the sun-follower.... Hmm, is that all of them?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> In the Mesopotamian creation mythos, these creatures fought the gods alongside Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> They were commanded by the god Kingu, the one chosen by Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But the army of the gods, with the help of the new god Marduk, were so powerful they defeated Kingu.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Tiamat bit hard into Marduk, but he defeated her with a final strike from his bow.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Tiamat lay there, defeated, and the gods ripped her body apart, turning it into a land that floats on the sea.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That was the land of Mesopotamia, a world created from the body of the fallen deity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s a pretty typical creation myth.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The body of the Earth Mother is used as soil to create the world. It is a theme seen in other mythologies too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A goddess creates life. But when she turns to chaos, she becomes the enemy of humanity, the mother of Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s an Authority called Potnia Theron, the “Womb of a Hundred Beasts. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyone with this Authority possesses the seed of life...They can make an infinite amount of monsters, provided they have the resources.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Based on the number of Demonic Beasts, the goddess to the north likely has this Authority.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah. And as a result, the people of Uruk see the Goddess of Demonic Beasts as Tiamat, and fear her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, it makes sense. The offspring of Tiamat are actually all here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Hmm. Regardless of her True Name, her Authority and the sheer number of her forces make her the greatest threat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I wonder if King Gilgamesh has some kind of plan...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If the enemy really is Tiamat, if we just keep defending, we&#39;ll eventually be overwhelmed.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s a problem for later. For now, we need to focus on the south, not the north, Roman.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Once we cross the Euphrates, we&#39;ll be at Ur. Fujimaru, are you ready?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Make sure you&#39;re well prepared. If we&#39;re unlucky, you&#39;ll be forced to fight the second goddess.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...? Everyone got quiet when you entered the forest. What&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s a dense forest, so I know you&#39;re worried about getting lost, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s SUPER hot!</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I agree. The heat is intense...I thought forests were...cooler...And quieter...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know how Ana feels...I underestimated this as well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The heat rising up from the ground, the strong smell of dirt, the cries of the animals that are sure to drive you crazy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is...what they call a jungle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Was this what Earth was like 65 million years ago, just before the asteroid hit?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Haha, are you talking about the great extinction? The one where an asteroid hit the Yucatán Peninsula and wiped out the dinosaurs?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can only watch you guys on the screen, but that&#39;s gotta be an exaggeration, right?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s no exaggeration! This is terrible! The heat! So many flies! And it&#39;s so hard to walk!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And this Ether is incredible! Much denser than the Isle of Britain!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Romani, are you monitoring the density of magical energy? It&#39;s on par with a Reality Marble!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, um...I&#39;m embarrassed to say, but the instruments are unstable.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s like Egypt. This is a different world, or rather, the mythological system itself is different.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can only do so much by pointing Sheba towards Uruk. I can&#39;t distinguish heat sources, let alone details of your surroundings.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;ll have to rely on your senses. Utilize your eyes and noses to detect danger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...So, basically, we can&#39;t use radar...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry...The problem is the sea of trees there. If there were fewer of them, I could help, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Eyes, sure. But nose...?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yup. In a jungle, your sense of smell is an important source of information. It tells you the past better than any echolocators.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The smell of an animal lingers in an area. If you could visualize it as a number, you could easily deduce what, when, and where it went.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s not only animals that hunt by sense of smell.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Humans can use their brains to do something similar.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> According to the map, Ur is one kilometer south. That means we only have to endure this heat for another 20 minutes, Master.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah. I seriously hope we&#39;re done after that! And next time let&#39;s hire a guide or a camel!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Heh...What a commendable idea! You wimps from the plains won&#39;t last a day without a guide!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Next time you want to enter the jungle, give money to a local, and lower your head to the ground and say this:</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> “Buenas noches, señorita! Señor, señor, do you want some peyote? ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master! I can&#39;t make it out, but something&#39;s there! It&#39;s moving at high speed above the trees!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Hahahaha! Hahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Meowhahahahahaha! I&#39;m not just something! I am—I am...Hmm. What am I?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Wait a minute. Asking meow for details puts meow into a tight spot...I know I&#39;m a purretty girl, but...</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> (Gasp) Oh no! While I was thinking I forgot where I put my booby (read: amusing) traps!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Tch! Curse you! You nerds should be ashamed of yourselves for challenging someone you&#39;ve never met to a battle of wits!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I got it! She&#39;s a dummy!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a bunny! Why does everybody think I&#39;m a bunny!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The not-bunny fell from above!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Bwah!?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What is this strange creature!? Did we just discover a new species!?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> No! I am no one! You might call meow an avatar of the jungle! An embodiment of great warriors!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> You can call meow Jaguar Warrior! Servant Jaguar Warrior makes an appearance!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now everybody focus on meow! I spent a year on this catchphrase and I want you all to hear it!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> “You may make fun of my name, you may forget about meow, but I am still here, for I am the ultimate tiger, Jaguar Warrior! ” (Hero pose)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hehe! (Satisfied grin)</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Fujimaru, give us your orders. The cold water of Ur awaits us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, we&#39;ll move on by taking out the local wildlife!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Roger! Tiger massacre commencing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that...the goddess of the sou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master! You mustn&#39;t say it! Let&#39;s pretend we saw nothing and fight!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Okay, I think I&#39;ve got it! You guys look yummy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Incredible speed! She leapt up above the jungle in an instant and retreated!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s going to be hard to follow her. Both physically and mentally.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I agree. She had a ridiculous outfit on, but she was still a powerful Servant.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If she attacked again, I don&#39;t think we could win. Let&#39;s get to Ur first and come up with a plan.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is...Ur...It&#39;s about the same size as Uruk, but...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...The trees are encroaching inside the city. It&#39;s hotter than Uruk, but not unbearable.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The density of mana in the air is the same as Uruk. And above all...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> People are living here normally...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. It&#39;s not as lively as Uruk, but the people of Ur are doing fine!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> They look a little down, though. We&#39;ll have to talk to one to learn more.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Excuse me, my lady. This is Ur, yes?</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> It is, but...who are you? Did you cross the river?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes. We&#39;re from Uruk. King Gilgamesh asked us to investigate what&#39;s been happening here.</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re from Uruk? That must&#39;ve been a hard journey. Were you the only survivors from your group?</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> If you were poisoned by snakes or stung by scorpions,I can refer you to a good doctor.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> How kind of you. Thankfully, we are uninjured. We&#39;re just here to investigate, so our party is small.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If the king had known you were alive, he would&#39;ve sent a large-scale rescue party.</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> A rescue party...I see. I&#39;m sorry. But we aren&#39;t evacuating to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Ur is safe, you see. As long as the jungle surrounds us, the Demonic Beasts can&#39;t come in.</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> And as long as we obey the rules of the forest goddess, the Demonic Beasts will not devour us.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Come to think of it, none of Tiamat&#39;s Demonic Beasts were in the jungle.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...You could even say the jungle is protecting the people of Ur.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...I see. I&#39;m assuming there are no casualties, then? Since this place is relatively safe compared to the rest of Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you never contacted Uruk. Did you think closing yourselves off in Ur was the best course of action?</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Of course not! We tried to send help to Uruk!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> But...It was...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A violation of the rules set by the forest goddess you speak of. I see.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You are safe, but at the same time you cannot leave Ur. Anyone who comes to help, or leaves to help, is killed by the forest.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So Ur&#39;s plan to defend itself is to do nothing at all.</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> ...Yes. I&#39;m glad you understand.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, I understand. If you don&#39;t resist, you can survive.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s the mentality of those who have given up. So, how many are chosen as sacrifices?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I assume it&#39;s one person a day?</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> ...! Wh-what are you talking about? There are no sacrifices—</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I can tell just by looking around. There are far too few men.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ur is not at war, so that is strange. Which means there must be another reason they&#39;re gone.</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> W-we&#39;re not at fault here! The sacrifices are a necessary price to pay!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Everybody agreed to this!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> All we have to do is offer one sacrifice a day to Eridu! That&#39;s all it takes to satisfy that devil!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha...!? Is that how you&#39;ve been surviving?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Without fighting? Or heading to Uruk?</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> You outsiders wouldn&#39;t understand!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> You haven&#39;t seen that terrifying goddess, or else you wouldn&#39;t say something so stupid!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Even with the people of Ur working together we&#39;re no match against that goddess! And negotiations do not work!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> It&#39;s truly a beast of the forest! All it does is eat and kill!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> All we can do is quake in fear and wait for our turn...!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> There&#39;s no place in Mesopotamia left that&#39;s still sane!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This is bad. I understand how Lady Mash feels, but I wish she could&#39;ve controlled herself for a few more minutes.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> See? All the other townspeople have fled into their homes out of guilt.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> At this point, we&#39;re intruders. It&#39;ll take time to persuade them. I wanted to get a little more info from them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t thinking about your plans, nor how that townsperson must have been feeling, and just blabbed on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I felt the same way.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...It&#39;s true that I hurt her. She&#39;s suffering far more than I am, yet I...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Hah...Hahahahahahahaha, hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> No need to have your tail between your legs! I was scolded for killing sacrifices, &#39;cause it&#39;s too old-fashioned!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Any warriors who have failed the trial of strength are forced into hard labor at Eridu!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Cause, you know, even if I eat them, they&#39;re like, different from us! I only want fancy feasts, like the heart of a hero!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that laughing voice is...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who&#39;s there!? Tell us your name!</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Meowhahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Look, up in the sky! What is that? Blue skies! White clouds! Yeah, that&#39;s a normal line.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I mean, it&#39;s a bird! It&#39;s a plane! It&#39;s civilization! No...It&#39;s the blazing Jaguar Warrior!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (She&#39;s totally not flying! )</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I love birds! I love fish! I eat people and stuff! Witness the astonishing teleportation of Jaguar Warrior!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (And she just ran over here normally! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...(Gulp)</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Heh...You were paw-sitively speechless from witnessing such a cool entrance. Fear not, [♂ señor /♀ señorita]!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Scold the people of Ur all you like. They&#39;re a bunch of wimps, so it&#39;s probably even a good thing.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But I won&#39;t let you take them outside. Because they&#39;re my emer-jaguar-cy rations!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> If you were to take them, not only would all my efforts go to waste, but then Kuku&#39;s gonna make me cry!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> So it&#39;s time for you to leave. Oh, hold on. Let me spit some good furball–I mean, insults out to you.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...Yes. This is our world. The world of the spiraling snake.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Begone, you humans who are devoid of the gods&#39; grace. As long as there is jungle, our sun is invincible—</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What I&#39;m getting at here is, “Have a nice day, jerks! ”</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> We got her...!? No, she&#39;s fast...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Heh heh, that was just an afterimage! My entire life is an afterimage!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This self-proclaimed Jaguar Warrior is a powerful foe! Our attacks aren&#39;t working at all!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...We&#39;ve got no choice! Fujimaru, retreat! She may not look like it, but she&#39;s a Divine Spirit!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We wouldn&#39;t stand a chance without another Servant of the same divinity! We&#39;ve got what we came here for!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We&#39;ve learned about the situation in Ur, and this mysterious Jaguar Warrior! That&#39;s enough to justify this trip!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right...! Mash, retreat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger...! We will leave Ur immediately!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dammit! I can&#39;t stop thinking about her identity!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> So you noticed...As expected from a Master...You&#39;ve unlocked Jaguar&#39;s secret CG!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But that is a dream you&#39;ll never reach again. And I see an opening now! Meowhaha! Die!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> We&#39;re retreating! So just ignore that thing, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew. We made it out of the jungle...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She caught up to us several times, but each time Ana drove her off...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Ana.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Please don&#39;t thank me. I&#39;m...not sure how to respond...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior annoys you?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes, a little. That onesie is tacky and non-functional.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s get back on track. Even if there were unexpected developments, we did our job well.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go back to Uruk and report our findings. I&#39;ll be curious to see the king&#39;s response.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s the situation in Ur.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We failed to defeat the enemy Servant or secure the people of Ur, but...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Grr...! And so you just retreated...!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The first mission I give you–one for the ages–and YET AGAIN you come back with another completely ridiculous story!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh, please calm yourself!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Fujimaru and the others came back alive! That alone is more than anyone else can say!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How come you guys got to run into such an amusing Servant!? I wanted to see them too!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Why do you guys keep getting the funny stuff while I&#39;m stuck here? I&#39;m a peaceful man, but I can&#39;t just sit here forever!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> You&#39;re like a kid who&#39;s been left out, my king!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s just frustrated...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...(Siduri&#39;s got it rough...)</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Humph. Anyway, good work with your investigation on Ur.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> For now, we&#39;ll put rescue efforts for the citizens of Ur and this Jaguar Warrior issue aside.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It seems that the Goddess of the Jungle sees things differently than the Goddess of Demonic Beasts in the north.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Really? Human sacrifices aren&#39;t part of our culture...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh? So is making offerings not part of your culture?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Discrimination. Prejudice. Entertainment. False convictions. Fear. You had no tradition of punishing the innocent for these reasons?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Well...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As long as human society exists, so will the tradition of human sacrifice in one way or another. However, what&#39;s happening in Ur is something different.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s barbaric, but there are reasons behind it, too. They don&#39;t kill to punish, but because they recognize its value.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Because they recognize its value...Are you saying that it&#39;s an honor to be chosen as a sacrifice?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s how I see it. Still, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that they&#39;re suffering. I hate to say it, but we can&#39;t do anything now.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Merlin, could you see Eridu from Ur? Was the axe intact?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No. The jungle is very dense, so I couldn&#39;t confirm the situation there.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But I could sense a powerful divinity. We can assume the axe is still in Eridu.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. That makes getting through the jungle a necessity. I&#39;ll have to start working on the carts...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Anyway, welcome back from your long journey, Fujimaru. I&#39;ll give you your next mission soon. You may go.</p><h2 id="section-6-encounter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-encounter" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Encounter</h2><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> (Yawn) Good morning, all. I see you&#39;re ready for the next assignment.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We still have time before Siduri arrives. So, what is for breakfast?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m coming in. Is this your dwelling? Uh-huh. For a latrine, it looks spacious.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What the...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> K-King Gil—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong></p><p>Lower your voice, Mash! You want Siduri to come running over!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-pardon me, King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...So, what can we, uh, do for you this morning?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For Your Majesty to visit our humble barracks is quite unusual...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. I figured I should mix things up. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve gotten tired of listening to Siduri&#39;s messages.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As such, I&#39;m going to personally give you your assignment this time. Nothing rough. Simply look into our water supply.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The wagon is ready. You&#39;re going to head south of Uruk, towards the Persian Gulf.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> An observatory has been constructed there. There are ten days&#39; worth of jars, made to automatically gather seawater.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You will deliver the empty jars that are in the wagon and bring back the jars there that are filled with seawater.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So we&#39;re transporting. Understood. It sounds like an easy job this time, Master!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s easy indeed. Especially since the route to the Persian Gulf is the only area that hasn&#39;t been attacked by any of the three goddesses.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You can carry out this duty without fear or worry. Know that you have my support.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh, Merlin and Ana aren&#39;t going with you this time. I only had two travel permits going to the Persian Gulf left over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...And so, it&#39;s just the two of us on this trip, Senpai. Or so I thought...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Such fine clouds by the Zagros Mountains. Here&#39;s a bit of wisdom: “Far-off sea of clouds. &#39;Round atop the white peak hill. Mountain of cedar. ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmm, that didn&#39;t sound quite the way I imagined...I guess playing mages isn&#39;t my forte...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh, why the honor?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No need to be so stiff. Sometimes I want to just look at the sea, nothing more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you have some time to waste?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool! What makes you think I&#39;d have any? Or even time to have fun! Precisely the reason I need to go on a trip like this!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Really? I don&#39;t really understand, but I assume we need to keep this a secret from Siduri then?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What is that grimace for?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just so you know, I&#39;m not doing this because I&#39;m exhausted from my duties.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m definitely not doing it because I crave excitement.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (mimicking the king&#39;s voice) If you say so.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Sigh) Good grief. King Gilgamesh, I apologize for interrupting your jovial mood.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re picking up some powerful magical energy signatures ahead. It seems you&#39;ve got trouble, which I believe is what you wanted.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. They are merely some abandoned colossi. Perfect for a warm-up.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s too much trouble to stop the wagon. Show me how you destroy your enemies, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course, if absolutely necessary, I suppose I could give you a hand.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As you can see, they all seem to be Assassin-class stone statues. There should be no need to mention who has the upper hand here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. Again, I&#39;ll help if absolutely necessary. Only if you insist!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh, arrrgh...! To think a front kick would tear a king&#39;s abdominal muscles!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What was that? Why was the third one a different class!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That lineup was way too sadistic...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They might as well have come three at a time...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Enough! From now on, illegal dumping of stone statues will incur severe penalties in Uruk!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve safely reached the observatory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It was smooth sailing after the statue incident. It was such a peaceful trip, Master.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Mmm. Nothing is happening. How boring. I had such high hopes for something silly happening on this journey.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The statue incident was pretty silly.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahaha. I&#39;d already forgotten about that. You two forget about it as well. Stop being pests.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So we just need to switch the jars?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Yes. Take these and replace them with the jars in the wagon. I&#39;m not fit to do physical labor. So get to it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuu! Fofo, foooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou, don&#39;t wander off too far!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew. The jars are all switched, so that&#39;s that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh stayed behind at the observatory. He said he had to check on something, but that he would be back in twenty minutes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So we can take a little break until then.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Sigh) If you&#39;d only come here during your day off, you could be swimming in the sea. That&#39;s too bad.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How does the Persian Gulf look to the naked eye? I bet it looks different from Okeanos.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In comparison, it looks quite a bit smaller. I mean, it&#39;s more of a port than an open sea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, the thought that the vast Indian Ocean is beyond this point is quite exciting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, in every era, humans came face to face with the vast ocean and conquered it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Also, the scale of the Seventh Singularity is much greater than any of the previous Singularities.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re getting observation results of the Indian Ocean, far beyond the Persian Gulf.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s because in Mesopotamia the ocean is an essential factor of life itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...The ocean...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai? You&#39;re staring into the horizon...Is there something on your mind?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A dream...? You heard the roar of the ocean in a dream...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is it okay for us to relax like this?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know how you feel. The Demonic Front, the forest surrounding Ur, and our search for the Grail...We have our work cut out for us.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But being impatient won&#39;t do anyone any good. You won&#39;t solve anything by charging blindly onto the battlefield. At least, not yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Being patient and assessing the situation is also part of the battle. Save your energy for when the time is right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...! Fou, fooooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou? Has something happened? You&#39;re jumping so much—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A contrail in the sky! Doctor, something is approaching from 9 o&#39;clock!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa, I can see it on my end as well! A speed of five hundred kilometers an hour with the mana concentration of the Age of Gods!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s going to make contact in 3, 2, 1...Mash, shield up! Brace for impact!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know what to say. It seems you people have a real lack of a sense of danger.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Not only are you far from Uruk, you would even come to a secluded area like this without an escort?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Either you&#39;re used to your own luck, or you greatly underestimated us...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Well, I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter. Either way, no one is coming to your rescue this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Enkidu...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. I&#39;m glad. A bit relieved, actually.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You&#39;re not the brightest out there, but at least you have the capacity to remember my name.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, Master! The enemy in front of us is not the Heroic Spirit Enkidu...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sensing the Mage King from this enemy...! I doubt it&#39;s the same entity as the Enkidu we heard about in Uruk!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The fake Enkidu...!</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That again? You treat me like an impostor just because I&#39;ve changed owners...Humans really are hopeless.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> However...I suppose you&#39;re right. I am not the actual Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I knew I had to make that clear. I mean, it&#39;d be annoying if you started to get the wrong idea about me in the future.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m an enemy to humans until I&#39;m destroyed. Whatever happens, that will never change.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;ll prove that by ending your lives right now. Your luck ran out the moment you came here to the port while Ishtar wasn&#39;t around to protect it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, but I won&#39;t make you suffer. I&#39;m not so brutal as the three goddesses.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The pain will be ghastly, but over in an instant. I&#39;m just going to skewer your entire body!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The fake Enkidu is entering a combat stance! Master, let&#39;s give our all!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Enkidu&#39;s endlessly firing all those powerful weapons at you...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Their fighting style is the same as the legendary King of Heroes, Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Of course! Creating an inexhaustible number of blades and firing every single one of them at you...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That is the optimal way to fight with this body. In fact, he&#39;s the one who&#39;s imitating me...!</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Well, isn&#39;t this a surprise. Surely I&#39;m misremembering, no?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> I recall a certain fool calling the new tactic I thought up, perfectly suited to a king as it was, the “ultimate waste of energy. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph. Naturally, I was correct. Your bad luck is as impressive as ever. I knew it was about time.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Ah...Wh...Y-you are...Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Who else would I be, you fool? To think you would waste so much time on a Servant.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What happened to efficiency? What happened to being calm and collected as a weapon? It&#39;s unlike you to enjoy the thrill of battle, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Ugh...Argh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, King Gilgamesh! That&#39;s an impostor, not the real Enkidu!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> An impostor...I see. Quite convincing nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In fact, you may be even more powerful than the original. That flying speed was impressive even by my standards.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You must have acquired a fine magical reactor core. Was it a gift from the three goddesses?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Nh...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Shut...your...mouth. Your voice irritates me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I am the most powerful creation on this planet. There is no need for a defective demigod like you.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Gilgamesh...Fool of a king, enemy of my mother...I WILL KILL YOU!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Never forget that! I will end this world and you along with it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Phew, saved. It looks like Enkidu retreated towards northern Uruk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But...I don&#39;t understand the reason for that retreat. Enkidu clearly had the upper hand.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Because King Gilgamesh showed up?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool. Even my help would not have balanced the scales. Only the Wedge of the Heavens can defeat the Chain of the Heavens.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But right now, I cannot use Ea. If we had fought them, I would have died alongside you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Enkidu looked to be in pain...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Maybe they were broken. Maybe some cessation of cardiopulmonary function. Well, those kinds of things happen.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Whatever it may be, it&#39;s over. Don&#39;t worry about it anymore. I&#39;ve already accomplished what I came here to do.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go back to Uruk, Fujimaru. Next time, I will give you an assignment that is most fitting for you!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Ugh...My body is out of calibration. My power output and motor functions are out of balance.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The recording is out of order, too. It&#39;s only giving me access to previous battle recordings...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t understand. Why is this heart defective?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Why did I retreat...!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I am stronger than them. I&#39;m stronger than that damn king...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So why...Why did my failsafe kick in? “If you fight him, you will die. ”</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...He is someone I should kill. He is the biggest thorn in Mother&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I must kill him. I must kill him. I must kill him. For Mother&#39;s sake, I must kill him.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But I want to talk...No, there is no room for conversation. I will only kill him. That should be sufficient.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. For I am not truly Enkidu.</p><h2 id="section-7-the-tablet-of-destinies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-the-tablet-of-destinies" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: The Tablet of Destinies</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash, and Merlin. I am entrusting you with something more important this time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;re going out to search for something. Head to the city of Kutha, and retrieve the Tablet of Destinies.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, this is an unexpected job. The Tablet of Destinies is in Kutha?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Correct. I remember seeing what lies in the future in Kutha when I was on my way back to Uruk from the underworld.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I meditated there, recorded the destiny upon a clay tablet, and left it there.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s natural to lose one&#39;s memory before or after meditation. I won&#39;t even know what kind of destiny was written until I read it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So, you wrote a diary in your sleep...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does...that happen often?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Occasionally. Normally gods grant humans visions, but in my case, I can see destiny through my clairvoyance.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Sometimes, I learn of a “future” not related to me, and I record it subconsciously.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s useless to me, but it&#39;s a priceless treasure to others.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course, the Demonic Beasts will not see value in that. It&#39;s highly likely that it&#39;s been left untouched.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh, gather information about Ishtar along the way. There are a few ranches on the way to Kutha.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I have damage reports coming from ranchers daily, all pointing the finger at Ishtar. Go find out more details.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Finally a job about the Three Goddess Alliance!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmm? ...Well, I guess it is. Much as it pains me to say it, that thing is still a goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is Kutha under Ishtar&#39;s influence?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Yes. Ishtar flies around northeast of Uruk and has complete control over its sky.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Warrior of Chaldea. I will grant you a pass to exit through Uruk&#39;s north gate.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, you don&#39;t have much time for this mission. Learn all you can and return in three days&#39; time.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Welcome back. You seem to be in a hurry. Is something the matter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! A new mission from King Gilgamesh, Ana!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This time, it will be a trip to Kutha to reclaim an item. The mission includes Master, Merlin, you, and me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Two days of traveling, and one day to search on-site. The best part is, the pay is twenty Priestess Silver!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Twenty Priestess Silver...I&#39;ll get ready immediately. Please stand by.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She is quite enthusiastic. Senpai, we should gather our belongings as well!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hmm...I&#39;m jealous...Even we&#39;ve never been to Kutha before.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;d love to accompany you, but...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> You shouldn&#39;t, Lord Ushiwakamaru. We must head to the Demonic Front tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> We are counting down to the mission to liberate Nippur. We cannot afford to go our separate ways.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Say no more, Benkei. I understand. I just wish I could at least go on a journey with Lord Fujimaru once, but...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get another chance if we just wait patiently. Now it&#39;s our duty as samurai to see them off with a smile.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Kutha is under Ishtar&#39;s control, but it is right next to the territory of the Goddess of Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There will be many powerful Demonic Beasts there as well. Please be careful on your way.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You be careful too, Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Haha. All we do is stand atop a wall and shout out orders, but thank you for your kind words.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Next time, let&#39;s go together.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes. I will eagerly await the next opportunity. Here&#39;s hoping it&#39;ll be as relaxing as paddling down a gentle stream.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Are you ready? Then, let&#39;s head for Kutha.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> After the formation of the Three Goddess Alliance, Kutha disappeared without warning.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> One day, we suddenly lost all communication from there. The expedition party that rushed there saw a quiet cityscape.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No blood, and the bodies showed no signs of combat. All citizens had met their end as if they died in their sleep.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is...a perplexing incident. Was it some kind of poison?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. None of the corpses had any wounds on them. They didn&#39;t die from Ishtar&#39;s arrows nor from the Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Since then, Kutha is said to be a cursed land, and has become a wasteland that no man ever approaches.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, in any case, we won&#39;t know till we get there. I expect to encounter wandering Demonic Beasts along the way...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But those that have strayed from their pack are no threat to Fujimaru anymore.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Let&#39;s try to gain the ranchers&#39; gratitude by quickly disposing of them as we move along!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher A:</strong><br> What did the goddess Ishtar do, you ask? Just look at all the holes in the ranch! It&#39;s obvious!</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher A:</strong><br> It&#39;s indiscriminate! She zooms around wildly, striking at random!</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher A:</strong><br> And that smug laugh...</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher B:</strong><br> I can&#39;t take it...I&#39;ve just had it...She always attacks right when we&#39;re busiest...</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher B:</strong><br> Whoosh, whoosh from the sky...Back in my dad&#39;s time, she supposedly promised bountiful harvests once every three years,</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher B:</strong><br> but this year, it&#39;s nothing but losses...It&#39;s a miracle that nobody has gotten hurt...</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher B:</strong><br> And that smug laugh...She just continues with it, on and on...</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher C:</strong><br> I know I should feel fortunate that I at least got a glance of the goddess Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher C:</strong><br> But I can&#39;t make a living just from gazing at beautiful things. Caring for sheep isn&#39;t cheap nowadays.</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher C:</strong><br> It&#39;s hard enough just trying to drive the Demonic Beasts back, but when we get attacked from the sky, what can we do?</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher C:</strong><br> The young ones we hired to exterminate the beasts fled...Oh, and that smug laugh...She sounds like she&#39;s having fun...</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher D:</strong><br> The goddess of fertility? Ha! In a few centuries, I&#39;m pooooositive she&#39;ll be called the demon of Venus!</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher D:</strong><br> My ranch is full of holes. My sheep ran off. On top of that, she&#39;s so merciless she kills off all the beasts under her command!</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher D:</strong><br> To make matters worse, she lands and is all, “I&#39;ll take all the gems in your house! ”</p><p><strong>Testimony: Rancher D:</strong><br> “I&#39;ll let you off with this,” she says, and flies off with a smug laugh! Dammit!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Those are all the testimonies from the ranchers.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar&#39;s indiscriminate attacks, obstructing ranch operations, and extorting the owners...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s no doubt about it. Ishtar is one special, wicked devil...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...A true money-grubber, huh...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The goddess of beauty who governs Venus is a greedy miser...It&#39;s true that Ishtar is a goddess that loves fortune, yes...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But she usually demands riches from the gods above her. There were no stories about her stealing money from humans...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...No. Could it be that she...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. I agree with Fujimaru. Ishtar&#39;s actions all have something in common.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...So, we shouldn&#39;t flat-out call her a fiend. Of course, she is still a greedy devil.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, there&#39;s an interesting tidbit about that. Actually, that Ishtar isn&#39;t the normal Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Right when the Demonic Beasts showed up in the north, a certain ritual was held by Uruk&#39;s Sacred Temple without the king&#39;s knowledge.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Simply put, they tried to summon Ishtar, the city&#39;s patron deity.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Uruk is under imperial rule, but it&#39;s governed under three powers: the king, the Ritual Sect, and the Sacred Temple.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of these, the Sacred Temple favors the patron deity over King Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> They saw the signs of this era turning into a Singularity, and saw the instability of space-time as their chance.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> As King Gilgamesh opened the treasury of Babylon, and built the fortress at the Northern Wall in Uruk,</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> the temple matron first summoned a soul compatible with a goddess&#39;s divinity, and tried to summon Ishtar using that soul.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s what you call a Pseudo-Servant in Chaldea. I don&#39;t know if that ritual succeeded or not.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But it is true that the patron deity of Uruk, Ishtar, has manifested nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Basically, the gods of Mesopotamia are blond. On the other hand, humans have black heads...black hair.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That Ishtar has black hair, meaning it is definitely a girl that served as her vessel.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s...so beyond surprising, I feel very sorry for her...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> According to the data observed here, that “Ishtar” is undoubtedly the goddess herself.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That girl must have been a human who was really compatible with her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The two egos have completely fused together, and created a goddess that is completely new, yet still the same.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah, but thanks to that, Fujimaru is still alive.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If Ishtar was the Ishtar of myth, Fujimaru would have been killed back in Babylon.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...You may be right. I may not get along with goddesses, but that Ishtar is ever so slightly human.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s so rare to hear your real feelings, Ana. How are things different if a goddess is like a human?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s nothing. I hate both. I hate Merlin more, though.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> By the way, Demonic Beasts are approaching from up ahead. Let&#39;s offer Merlin as a sacrifice so they let us pass.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Sorry, I misspoke! I&#39;ll apologize and do some physical labor for once!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s gallantly drive them away, Fujimaru! Once we go over this hill, Kutha will be right up ahead!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is Kutha...A city that went completely silent overnight...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> What devastation...Did the Demonic Beasts invade the city after the residents died?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...No, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You are the only life I&#39;m detecting in that city. The Demonic Beasts aren&#39;t trying to get in.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know why, but the Demonic Beasts seem to be afraid to enter the city.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Humph...My special “I&#39;ll survive no matter what” instincts are also telling me there are no threats here.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Instead, there&#39;s merely this eerie silence. It&#39;s as if death itself has cleansed the city.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Both King Gilgamesh and I missed this. The incident here in Kutha is fundamentally different from other cities.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It even almost feels like the king left the Tablet of Destinies here for a reason, but...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No, before we get too deep into theorizing, let&#39;s go on a treasure hunt.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Mash, go east. I&#39;ll go north. Ana, go west. And Fujimaru can look south.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well, no, I...I am Senpai&#39;s Servant, so I can&#39;t exactly leave Fujimaru&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. Fortunately, the Demonic Beasts won&#39;t come in. Fujimaru has Roman&#39;s navigation as well.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, and Cath Palug is around. He may not look it, but he gets things done in a pinch.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm...I&#39;m against that idea as well, but it certainly is more efficient to split up.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m not picking up any enemies on my end, and Mash and Ana won&#39;t be that far away.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Besides, there will be a time when Fujimaru needs to investigate alone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...And for that–as with all things–firsthand experience is needed. I don&#39;t see the harm in splitting up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine, I&#39;ll holler if there&#39;s something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This place is huge anyway. It&#39;s for the best.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...All right. If Master says so, then it&#39;s okay.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s decided, then. Let&#39;s start the investigation.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The Tablet of Destinies is the same type of clay tablet as King Gilgamesh&#39;s Dingir.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It emits a minute amount of magical energy, so you should feel it if it&#39;s nearby.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Let&#39;s split up and look around for about an hour. We&#39;ll all meet back here after, no matter what we find!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (...Well, it&#39;s been about 10 minutes...)</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm, desolation as far as the eye can see...Merlin said a minute amount of magical energy,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> but with the mana density around us so high to begin with, it&#39;ll be practically impossible to find...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have a look around.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, they say investigation is all legwork.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Chaldea&#39;s observation waves are centered around you,Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So basically the signals near you are the most detailed—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, I just—</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...Foooou!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where am I!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Doctor, Doctor!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> The living...It&#39;s the living. What are the living doing in the underworld...Why...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Have you come to laugh...to seize...Have you come to flee...or to discard...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Unforgivable...all are unforgivable...Warm breath, warm flesh...They&#39;re unnecessary...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Die...die, die, die, die, die die die die diediediediediediediediediediediediediediedie!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Waaaaaaaaah!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aughhhhhhh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooou!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> ...Wait. O gallû spirits, this one yet lives.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Taking this soul will incur your master&#39;s wrath. Seal up the seven gates, and resume your guard of the soul cages.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m saved...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You are...</p><hr><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Blame not the spirits. Your intrusion was most brazen, young one.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> The land of the dead is shut to those who yet draw breath. Each step you take invites the gallû spirits&#39; ire.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> ...But fortune favors fools, and I owed you this debt.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> A callow neophyte you may be, but steadfast, too. Devotion, mayhaps, demonstrates worth. So have you shown yours.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Well, um...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This makes no sense...</p><hr><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Beneath Kutha spreads the underworld itself. You chanced to fall into the land of the dead while you still draw breath.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> But now your sojourn must end. I shall seal the gate.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Return, young one, to the living world, and speak these words to the mage: “All is well in the underworld. ”</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou...fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A dream...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I have returned. I couldn&#39;t find anything useful on my end...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...? Senpai, that thing you&#39;re sitting on, could it be—</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, both of you are back already. Oh boy, that went nowhere. What a waste of...Huh?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I scoured the western area, but I didn&#39;t see anything like a clay tablet...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, that thing you&#39;re using as a seat is, by all appearances, the Tablet of Destinies!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fo...foooooou!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No doubt about it. That&#39;s the Tablet of Destinies. Great! Well, that was easy!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But where was it? I didn&#39;t think it would be in the southern area.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, I fell underground...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ziusu-dra rescued me...</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Underground, hmm? I don&#39;t see a hole...And an old man named Ziusu-dra, you say?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Romani, what about your records? Weren&#39;t you monitoring Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, I have no record of the past few minutes...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s as if...Fujimaru&#39;s life had ceased...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t possibly have heard you right; you said that old man called himself Ziusu-dra?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I met him in Uruk, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ziusu-dra is, in Sumerian legend, the one man who survived the flood that killed mankind.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He is akin to Noah in the Old Testament, and Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The one who saw the end of the world and became the Guardian of the Abyss.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You could say he&#39;s the one who warns of the end of the world, or the one present at the death of all things.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it was actually Ziusu-dra, but since Ishtar and Enkidu are around, there is a possibility.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The fact that Ziusu-dra has appeared...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm...Unless it was merely someone taking on a role similar to Ziusu-dra&#39;s. That&#39;s not a name you claim for show or on a whim, though...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But still, “All is well in the underworld,” huh?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...That means the Queen of Kur has also materialized...Which means the three goddesses I saw through clairvoyance are...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...! Everyone, be careful! An incredibly powerful Spirit Origin is headed your way!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is the third time I&#39;ve seen this pattern...No doubt about it! It&#39;s Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I found you, wretched humans! Apparently you grilled the ranchers all about me!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re up to, but cut it out!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Snooping around about what a goddess does on a day off? That&#39;s so insensitive!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Queen Ishtar is firing warning shots...minus the “warning” part! Master, please take cover behind those buildings!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, look here, it&#39;s the goddess who saves up all the gems she filches off people!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t good. It looks like we&#39;re her target this time!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> After all, we received plenty of riches from King Gilgamesh! Our purses are full to bursting with royal swag!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No! I&#39;m saying THAT crap is ruining my reputation! I&#39;ve never assaulted humans for money or anything!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What I ask for is due compensation! First of all, saving humans for free would just doom them all over again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Save...for free? The whimsical Ishtar, saving humans...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh...Just as I thought...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m starting to see the picture here...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That won&#39;t do...I&#39;ve messed up and said too much.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ANYWAY! You all need divine punishment. Atone for the sins of making me look silly not once, but TWICE.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Specifically, that thing you have that looks like a treasure...It looks interesting, so I&#39;ll be taking it. Gimme.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> After that, let&#39;s see...Yes, if your purses are so fat, I&#39;ll help you slim them down!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Brace yourselves. Your luck ends right now. What&#39;s yours is going to be mine!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s useless. Where do you think you are? We&#39;re upstream on the Tigris River with a view of Mt. Ebih!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t fly, don&#39;t think for a second you&#39;re going to be able to catch me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is bad! We can&#39;t beat Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we somehow get the upper hand, she&#39;ll just fly away in her boat!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. That&#39;s not fair, Ishtar! You should come down and fight fair and square!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Dummy! I&#39;m not giving up my advantage! Now playtime is over, and it&#39;s time for me to get serious—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ser...i...ous...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She stopped moving...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now, Ana!</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Here I go! Even if I can&#39;t fly, if I have a roof this high up...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve got you!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh? Where did you come from!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She crashed! That...That looked painful...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ouchies...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...She fell right on her head...Senpai, I think she&#39;s...Yeah, she&#39;s out cold!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Umm, Master? What should we do with her...?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Let&#39;s kill her while we can. She&#39;s just going to be annoying once she wakes up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s true. For now...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Owww! My head! ...What&#39;s going on? Where am I? Am I tied up?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What is the meaning of this!? I want an explanation! Just what is going on here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, she&#39;s awake.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Awake? Of course I&#39;m awake. It&#39;s nighttime! Anyway, who are you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good morning.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes, good morning. I like proper greetings.... So who are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hey, that&#39;s the Beast of Disaster? Why is that thing here!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wait. Am I going to get eaten? Am I going to be a sacrifice!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please calm down, Ishtar. We mean you no harm.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We want to ask you something.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Also, please note that your legs and hands have been restrained for our protection.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> !?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Tying me up? Unthinkable! Do you have any idea who I am!? Aren&#39;t you afraid of what might happen to you later!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, you&#39;ve already threatened us plenty.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> R-really? Well, you don&#39;t look like you&#39;re lying...I see...I guess I&#39;m a pretty cruel goddess...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Well, maybe after a fashion, I guess...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I&#39;m scary, aren&#39;t I? Well, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m used to it. I&#39;m the most hated person in all of Mesopotamia...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But do you really think rope can hold me? If I wanted to, I could kill you all.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now now, we&#39;re quite prepared on our end.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This rope was specially woven with your beloved lapis lazuli, and the hides of Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Even the great Ishtar would need a moment to get out of it. And that&#39;s plenty of time for my young friend here to end you.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. My scythe can kill immortals. I am not going to kill you...But I will hurt you very, very badly if you move.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...I see. It seems you&#39;ve actually captured me.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So what about it? Is there something you want to ask before killing me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We don&#39;t want to kill you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Who knows if that&#39;s true? Well, I have a pretty good idea. It&#39;s about the Three Goddess Alliance, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tell us about the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yeah, I knew it. Very well. What do you want to know?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our questions are simple.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why do the goddesses attack Uruk? What are the True Names of the other goddesses?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And who summoned you? Could you tell us, please?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hmm...What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I see. Mash. What about that human over there?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Fujimaru, then.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Very well. Since you were foolish enough to tell me your names, I will answer what I can.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> To address your first question. The reason why we, the Three Goddess Alliance, attack Uruk. This goes without saying, but we wish to control the world.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, technically, I want to rule humans, and the goddess of the north wants to rule the world...There&#39;s a slight difference.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And the goddess of the south...Hmm...I&#39;m not sure about her. She&#39;s from a different culture, so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with her.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> In any event, we&#39;re in competition with each other...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> To see who can destroy Uruk first and obtain the Holy Grail in King Gilgamesh&#39;s keeping.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The first goddess to obtain it will control the land.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The other two will either leave, or remain to serve as subservient deities.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That is the goal of the Three Goddess Alliance. Simple, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Tell us the other goddesses&#39; True Names.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I cannot tell you that. The Three Goddess Alliance has a pact that prohibits us from attacking each other.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> This pact is sacred, and cannot be violated. Exposing the True Names of the other two goddesses would be tantamount to an attack.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You and Fujimaru wouldn&#39;t expose the secrets of your good friends, would you?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> A goddess gossiping about someone behind their back would be disgracing herself, you know.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I will not divulge the True Names of the other two goddesses, even under threat of death. Understood?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, then. Let&#39;s just move on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Good answer. I love noble humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You were acting so selfishly not too long ago...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s true. I actually agree with you...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And to answer your question about who summoned us...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I was summoned by the Sacred Temple in Uruk. But the goddesses of the north and south are different.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Those two were drawn here by the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure whether that was the Mage King&#39;s plan or not.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I see. That&#39;s about what we thought.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So Ishtar was less aggressive than the other two goddesses because of the way she was summoned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thanks for telling us.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We&#39;re enemies, but you have treated me with respect. Thank you for that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But why join the alliance?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Isn&#39;t it obvious? I have a problem with you humans.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to bring down Uruk in my own way. If the other goddesses want to kill you, then I&#39;ll kill you first.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Was that everything you wanted to know? Then, may I ask a question?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you&#39;re a Chaldea mage, correct?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Chronologically, you&#39;re humanity&#39;s last Master, correct?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I won&#39;t be the last.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s some big talk, and it&#39;s rare to hear. That&#39;s good. I like you even more now.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...Fou? Fo, fo, fo, fo, fo, fooooou!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fou, we&#39;re in the middle of an important discussion. Please calm down. If you need food, you&#39;ll get some later—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Later...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, this is bad! Skeletons are appearing all over the city!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> R-really!? I&#39;m not picking up anything over here!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All I see is a large amount of magical energy! There&#39;ve been no irregularities—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh! That&#39;s it! No wonder I didn&#39;t notice!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In the A. D. era, a magical energy reaction this large would be abnormal, but we&#39;re in the Age of Gods!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Some moving corpses won&#39;t cause any noticeable difference in our measurements! Something like that wouldn&#39;t even be considered unusual!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That seems to be the case. This is strange, though! The swarm is larger than the entire population of Kutha!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...We should retreat. Fortunately, we&#39;ve recovered the clay tablet we were after.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, pull back from Kutha as fast as possible! You&#39;re going to get eaten up by skeletons at this rate!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that! But before that...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Respectfully undo the rope. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Reluctantly undo the rope. )</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, hurry! Ana and I will focus our attacks to break through!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Wait. Why did you release me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Because you&#39;re not attacking Uruk.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I thought we could talk things over.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Guh...That&#39;s...impossible. Even if I wanted to talk, I couldn&#39;t.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Please hurry! More are coming by the second!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm...We have a problem here. Earlier, I said the number of enemies exceeded the population of Kutha. Let me rephrase that.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This has nothing to do with the population of Kutha. To be precise, these skeletons are all the people who died on this land in the past.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I mean, look over there. Even their ancestors are all here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s no use! They&#39;ve blocked our path! They&#39;re weak individually, yes, but there are just too many of them!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. If only I were older...I could blast them away with my Noble Phantasm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was...!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Now you know not to go near Kutha. If you&#39;re ever captured in the underworld, you&#39;ll find out just how hard it is to come back.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar provided covering fire for us! ...Now she&#39;s flying off to the northeast!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That was really more like air support than covering fire. Not sure what came over her, but I think we&#39;re safe now.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now&#39;s our chance to pass through the southern gate. We&#39;ve got the tablet already, so let&#39;s get outta here!</p><h2 id="section-8-uruk-s-northern-wall" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-uruk-s-northern-wall" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: Uruk&#39;s Northern Wall</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Stop, stop already, you fools!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way I could record a story like that for posterity! So, first you swatted her out of the sky, and then you tied her up!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And then, after you released her out of sheer pity, she helped you escape, and fled home?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ishtar&#39;s actually entertaining this time! I think I&#39;ll have to give her a speck of credit now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your Majesty, I think you&#39;re laughing too much.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hm, true. It&#39;s unlike me to waste my time being amused over some goddess.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;ve done a fine job this time. I&#39;m sure it was a good lesson for Ishtar too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is Ishtar really an enemy of mankind?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course she is. She will always be an enemy of mankind. Even if by some fraction of a chance she changed,</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> her existence itself sends the world into chaos. That&#39;s just the nature of her divinity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She&#39;s the seed of conflict. She incites war, inspires greed, and torments mankind.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She&#39;s a hopeless idiot, but she&#39;s not evil at her core. That&#39;s why she is such a nuisance.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If she were just completely evil from head to toe, I would have no qualms about destroying her.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ah, well. Next job, Fujimaru. Do you know of Nippur?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The city beyond Uruk&#39;s Northern Wall, yes? Beyond the Demonic Front...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I heard its fortifications rival even Uruk&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. They&#39;ve been surviving by locking themselves inside their walls while under siege by Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Those beasts have a set attack cycle. They&#39;re not exactly demons immune to hunger and exhaustion.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We&#39;ve been evacuating the citizens of Nippur little by little in between their attacks. However, their supplies have finally run out.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> They cannot hold out any longer. Therefore, we must evacuate any remaining survivors immediately.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is going to be a large-scale rescue mission. But, um...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean by the beasts having an attack cycle?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In that respect, they&#39;re no different from humans. I mean that they don&#39;t fight all day and all night.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Take an Ušumgallu, for example. It could take as many as ten soldiers to bring one down...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, it doesn&#39;t have much in the way of stamina. According to legend, it could run thousands of miles in a day. But, if you study it, that seems unlikely.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> An Ušumgallu can only maintain its maximum speed for about a minute. After that, it slows down and must feed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, you&#39;re talking about burning calories. There&#39;s also muscle fiber and blood vessel endurance.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same with cheetahs. The fastest animal on Earth, they can get up to speeds of eighty kilometers per hour in a space of about two seconds.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it turns out that kind of high performance can be dangerous. Maintaining that speed for more than about ten seconds could burn up their brains.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why cheetahs always chase their prey for under ten seconds, and burn incredible amounts of calories doing it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If it can take down its prey, the cheetah wins. But if the prey can evade the cheetah for more than ten seconds, the prey wins.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Not bad, you catch on quick. Precisely, a Demonic Beast is not that much different than any other creature.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> On the other hand, a Mušḫuššu doesn&#39;t have much combat power, but it has incredible endurance. It can be active for a whole day without feeding.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So you see, Demonic Beasts all have special traits. Usually they never fight alongside each other.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, there&#39;s probably someone commanding them all. The commander brings them together and they come to attack once every seven days.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It may not be on the dot, but we estimate the timing, and send our strongest against them.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That was all thanks to Tomoe&#39;s work too.... Hmph. She may have been mixed-blood, but she was a fine warrior.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, her defeating Girtablilu was big. If she hadn&#39;t been there, the front would&#39;ve collapsed long ago.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So this time it&#39;s our job to play that role, am I right?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Right. The other day, Ushiwakamaru and Benkei fought against the Demonic Beasts&#39; attack.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There will be no attacks for another six days. During this pause, lead the people of Nippur to the Northern Wall!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If you manage this, I shall take back what I said about you being unnecessary!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As the protector of the Foundation of Humanity, you may become my proxy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh is finally going to accept us!</p><hr><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Wait, Siduri. You&#39;re crying? Why?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Oh?! N-no, that is not true.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> As Fujimaru&#39;s caretaker, I just was reminiscing about all the struggles we&#39;ve endured up until now.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It means you guys are finally at the starting point. Well, it actually went rather quickly, considering how things usually go with the king.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Anyway, what are you going to do with the Tablet of Destinies? I thought deciphering it was also an important task?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No, I won&#39;t read it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fujimaru is the one who obtained it. Fujimaru should read it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t read it.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You do not need to. Just lay your hands on its surface and say this:</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “Ur na-nam, ur na-nam. Dur-an-ki, gir-edin. ”It means “There was a city, there was a city...The meeting place of heaven and earth, ■■ empty fields. ”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Ur na-nam, ur na-nam...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Dur-an-ki, gir-edin...</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That king&#39;s evil deeds...That king&#39;s cruelty...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That demon who stood by and smiled as the world&#39;s tragedies unfolded before him...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I cannot let this stand. I cannot forgive him.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> So, I leave this in hope–hope that these words will be passed on.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> In every age, in every land, the history of mankind has been one of tragedy.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Those who kill their children. Those killed by their children. Those who know no affection. Those who abandon all affection.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Those who grieve at betrayal. Those who live for betrayal. Those who know no family. Those who abandon their families.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Those who lose wealth. Those who die for wealth. Those who know no love. Those who scorn all love.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Those who desire success. Those who loathe success. Those who defend religion. Those who despise religion.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> They love their kin, detest outsiders, gain wisdom, spread ignorance, hold grudges, misunderstand, love discrimination, praise persecution, and pity compassion.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> What hideous, pitiable creatures they are. However, when they are mere commoners, they may be forgiven.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Humans are imperfect. They endure their pain and loss, and live with their contradictions.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> But what of an almighty king? A king with the power and means to set matters right? Then it&#39;s a different matter entirely.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> He had eyes to see into the past and the future, to see all the world&#39;s struggles and sorrows.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> And he stood by. He laughed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ignorance might have excused him, but even enlightened, he only laughed.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> “Even knowing this, you feel nothing!? You would do nothing to stop it all!? ”</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> In answer, the king said only this:</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> “Not particularly. ”</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...This man, this king, can never be forgiven. So say we all.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Here we inscribe our rage. Here, future generations may read of our fury, and follow in our footsteps.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Construct a temple. Build a band of light.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You will need every resource to destroy him. You will need all of time to forget his indifference.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Find the path to the Final Singularity. That is where the throne of the King of Mages resides.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> The name of that plane is Solomon. The end of the very end. The altar of spinning time. The hope at the very beginning—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!? Are you all right? You look pale!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I feel like I was having a terrible nightmare...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see from the look on your face that you haven&#39;t received a definite answer. However, that fate is now sealed.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This clay tablet is the inscription of what I unknowingly “saw” when I returned from the Abyss.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s one of the few clues to finding the self-proclaimed King of Mages–the man who incinerated humanity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Eventually, there will be a time when you will come to understand what you had a glimpse of just now.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Until then, keep it in the back of your mind. Eventually, you will be forced to face it.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wow! Look at this, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s every bit as bustling as Uruk! It&#39;s a fortress, but there are lots of people besides soldiers working!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course there are. They&#39;ve kept up defenses of this scale for six months. You&#39;d need a city to maintain something like this.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, but be careful. The walls repel the Demonic Beasts, but...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Alert! Alert! Breach at G-17! All nearby citizens, evacuate! Lion squad, roll out!</p><p><strong>Demonic Beast:</strong><br> Guuuuruuaaaaaaaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> As you can see, Demonic Beasts with strong legs will run up the walls on their own!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s no need to hold back, Fujimaru. Weren&#39;t you bored on the way here?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Let&#39;s start off strong by showing these guys what we can do!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Okay, there was nothing for me to do! Everyone, welcome to the Northern Wall!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been waiting for you as well. I helped a little in secret, but I&#39;ll beg your pardon for that.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Whew. I finally caught up to you. Lord Ushiwakamaru, please stop jumping off the walls.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> If you dive into a horde of Demonic Beasts on your own, even you may find yourself in a bit of trouble.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hello, everyone.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Oh, Lord Fujimaru. Glad to see you arrived safely.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Mash, Merlin, and Ana are all here too. Yes, with this group, tomorrow&#39;s operation should go off without a hitch!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everybody&#39;s here.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Yes, finally. I&#39;ve been looking forward to this.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s our first co-op mission with the strangers from beyond our time who live at the embassy. Naturally, I am excited.</p><hr><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Let&#39;s all head inside for now. There&#39;s a lot to talk about, but I&#39;ll brief you on the situation first.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> This is the Dingir artillery platform, the core of our anti-Demonic Beast defenses along the fortress walls.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It has the same name as the clay tablet King Gilgamesh owns.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this another of his treasures?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Yes. King Gilgamesh owns many weapons of great power.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> This is a large ballista that allows us to manually launch them. There&#39;s a lapis lazuli embedded in the base.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> When the soldiers shatter it with a hammer, the stored magical energy is released, and fires the treasure at the target.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> An Uruk-style–or maybe I should say a King Gilgamesh-style–ballista.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The normal King of Heroes would never allow his soldiers to use his treasures as disposables.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. They&#39;re very valuable, so he&#39;d only use them against powerful masses of foes.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be aimed very accurately, so it&#39;s mostly used to scare the enemy. We&#39;re lucky if it hits anything.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Dingir means “deified. ” In Sumer, anything can be elevated to godhood by great deeds.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A god recognized not by other gods, but by man. In other words, a faith by humanity, for humanity.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The king naming these tools Dingirs shows his intention to have Uruk protected only by humans.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Oh, I didn&#39;t know that...I see. A victory won solely by human hands.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that it&#39;s wrong to beg the gods for help when you&#39;re in danger. The only god who will answer to that plea is the god of death.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. The gods only help out the winning side. If a side looks at all like they&#39;re going to lose, they won&#39;t even come near.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So what&#39;s the plan to liberate the city of Nippur? What does Fujimaru have to do?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...Well, it&#39;s difficult to say this, but the situation has changed a little.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Every night, we&#39;ve lead the people of Nippur to the Northern Wall under the cover of darkness...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But last night the movements of the Demonic Beast horde changed. They&#39;re now patrolling the outskirts of Nippur.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> A new commander has most likely appeared to replace Girtablilu.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Girtablilu...The Demonic Beast commander who was defeated before we arrived, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does that mean they&#39;re aware of our plan?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> We should assume so.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> That makes opening the Nippur gate dangerous on its own. But the people of Nippur are already starting to starve.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> We can&#39;t delay the rescue mission any longer. So we&#39;re going with a diversionary tactic.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Lord Ushiwakamaru and Lord Benkei&#39;s unit will head towards Nippur from the east.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Naturally, the Demonic Beasts will attack them.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> When they do, Lord Fujimaru, Lady Mash, Lord Merlin, and Lady Ana will enter Nippur from the west.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Open the gate and then lead the survivors to our Northern Wall.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Roger that.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know about getting picked for this, but given the circumstances, I suppose it makes sense.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Won&#39;t it be hard on Ushiwakamaru&#39;s group?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> No need to worry. Fighting on flat ground is what Benkei and I do best.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Besides, we&#39;re not allowed into Nippur anyway. King Gilgamesh said so himself.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> “I forbid you to enter Nippur. No matter what. These are the king&#39;s orders. Do not disobey. ”</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> He was very insistent.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He doesn&#39;t want you to go into Nippur? Do the people there not like you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m confused as well. I&#39;ve never been to Nippur.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Sometimes the king says strange things, you know. I&#39;m sure this is one of his bad jokes.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> We&#39;ll go tomorrow, when the sun is a seventh of the way up in the sky. Do as you like until then.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Um, do you have a map of Nippur?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Well, I have been carrying this notebook as a substitute for recording the temples I had visited.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Fwahaha. Would you like to read it, Lady Ana? After all, I have quite the list of achievements as an instructor.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> No thank you. I&#39;ll get one from the soldiers.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Smart, Ana. Let me see it later.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Go get your own. I only got one to kill time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Shall we go together?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...No thank you. Fujimaru, please rest.</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm. Everybody&#39;s getting some sleep before tomorrow&#39;s fight. Morale&#39;s good, and we have enough combat strength, but...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Something doesn&#39;t seem right. And my intuition is never wrong at times like this.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Somebody might be saying goodbye tomorrow. One, no, maybe two.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If our people start dying off now, it will complicate matters in the future. I&#39;d like to avoid that, but—</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...(Smack)</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oww. It&#39;s rude to smack people for no reason, Cath Palug.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> What? If I have time to walk, I should sleep? None of the women here at the Northern Wall are my type?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> How rude. I&#39;m working, whether I look like it or not. See? (Knock, knock, knock)</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> See? These flowers I just planted here? They&#39;ll take root in the wall, and should reinforce it a bit. I&#39;m a helper.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou. Foufo, fooon-kyuu.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> “Oh? Not bad, for a loser like you, Merlin. ” Is that what you said?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You&#39;ve gained a nasty mouth since the last time I saw you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Then what was the point in me letting you out of that tower?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Fofofo, fou.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm. You have a nasty mouth, but you&#39;ve gotten clever. That makes you even harder to deal with!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm? Is that you, Ana? What are you doing at this corner of the wall?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Nothing. I&#39;m just getting some night air.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm. You certainly don&#39;t look convincing with that furrowed brow.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But it&#39;s a smart idea not to head into the Cedar Forest alone. There&#39;s no way to clear that temple right now.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now do you believe what I told you about the fastest way to improve the situation being one step at a time?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t believe you at all. The reason I&#39;m still here is...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Is it too late to tell them what&#39;s going on? Maybe if I do, they&#39;ll at least...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, are you sure? I think that might freak out even Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...You think so? But even so...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s not good. Not good at all.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Your distrust of humans is starting to waver, and your hopes for them are coming back.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Emotions are, in general, things to be discarded. But if you&#39;re able to reclaim them, it&#39;d be a waste to not cherish them.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You&#39;re keeping your distance from humans not because you don&#39;t like them, but because they scare you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You&#39;re afraid they&#39;ll find out who you really are. You&#39;re afraid they&#39;ll hate you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s an emotion hard to come by. You could call it the conscience of the divine being you truly are.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That conscience–or its lack–is the greatest difference between you and her. To toss it aside would be a waste, Ana.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...So you&#39;re telling me to keep quiet and hide it?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s the smartest thing to do. What&#39;s wrong with a non-human hiding her inhumanity?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I mean, I say that, but I&#39;m no different. To tell the truth, I don&#39;t have a heart like a human.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Because I have no emotions, I feed off of people&#39;s dreams, and harvest the “subtleties of the heart” from them.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The only reason I can keep on being a nice bro-next-door is because I&#39;m expending the emotions I&#39;ve gathered up to this point as fuel.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s difficult for beings such as us to think and live like humans.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The fake Enkidu was correct. Fairies, gods, and creatures of that sort are inhuman.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But there&#39;s no rule that what&#39;s inhuman must necessarily be an enemy of mankind, right?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You&#39;re allowed to side with them because it&#39;s fun. Whether they love you, or if you can love them, is a different matter.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Do you love mankind, Merlin?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course not. I&#39;m inhuman. A half-breed sired by an incubus. I&#39;ve done all kinds of awful things in the name of helping human society.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I love the patterns mankind weaves. I&#39;ve never really liked individual humans themselves.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...And trying to justify it all to myself only tore me apart. It&#39;s what resulted in me locking myself in my tower. But that&#39;s a different story.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Who cares if you hide who you are until the end? It&#39;s not going to hurt anyone.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fujimaru won&#39;t care that you hid something. Doesn&#39;t care now, right?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fujimaru is happier being with you now than [♂ he would /♀ she would] be if [♂ he /♀ she] found out your secrets.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. And that annoys me.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s humiliating. Having you tell me this, Merlin, is the biggest shame of my life. In the end, I will kill you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Humph. I&#39;ll take that as a compliment.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Even if you did reveal your True Name, it would only tell them who the enemy is. It wouldn&#39;t help them fight it.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Your existence would be the vital point the Goddess of Demonic Beasts didn&#39;t expect.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If there&#39;s a time to for you to throw away everything, it&#39;s going to be only in a single instant. Watch for that instant as you fight.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Of course, amid all this foreshadowing, it&#39;s worth mentioning that I don&#39;t want that kind of ending at all! &#39;Cuz that would be boring!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Sad partings aren&#39;t my style. I prefer to deceive and disparage the enemy, and emerge as the victor unharmed!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s the most beautiful pattern humans can create. Why don&#39;t we take a lesson from it, Ana?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Disgusting. You only say what&#39;s most convenient for you.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...But I guess I don&#39;t mind putting in some effort to make that outcome a reality.</p><h2 id="section-9-the-mother-of-demonic-beasts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-the-mother-of-demonic-beasts" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: The Mother of Demonic Beasts</h2><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s time. The sun has reached its appointed position.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> At this time, the majority of Demonic Beasts will be hungry. They&#39;ll attack any prey that comes within their line of sight.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The raiding party led by Benkei and myself will be an easy target for them.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Of course, we don&#39;t intend to be their food. Let&#39;s show them how the prey becomes the predator.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you. If even one of them realizes the vanguard is a diversion, we won&#39;t be able to stop the pack&#39;s collective will.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> We estimate there are more than two hundred of them on the outskirts of Nippur. Hopefully Lord Ushiwakamaru&#39;s force will be enough for the diversion.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...I would have liked one hundred more of you to fight in the plains, but I can&#39;t take away any more soldiers from the Northern Wall&#39;s defense.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Until the citizens of Nippur reach the Northern Wall—</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Or rather, until they are far enough away from Nippur, please continue to distract the Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Put your faith in us. I&#39;d like to promise you that we can dispose of that many in short order...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But, unlike humans, Demonic Beasts do not care about wounds or losses. If they do not retreat even when their pack is reduced by half,</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure it will turn into a long battle. One that won&#39;t end until we kill the last one of them. And then there&#39;s my promise to King Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> No matter what happens in Nippur, we cannot come to Lord Fujimaru&#39;s aid.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So, please be careful.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mm? Ushiwakamaru, what&#39;s your promise to the king?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s private. Believe me, it has nothing to do with anyone else, so please forget I said anything.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s be off. I&#39;m sure the mission will be over by the time the sun reaches its peak.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Let&#39;s all have lunch together. Come, Benkei!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, we should be on the move, too. Our guide is waiting for us below.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Now then, allow me to go over the mission we outlined during last night&#39;s meeting.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> There are over two hundred citizens left in Nippur.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The majority of them are those who could not be evacuated: the women, the elderly, and the wounded.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure they&#39;re afraid and won&#39;t try to leave Nippur unless their safety is guaranteed.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> First, we will protect and escort the guide, a former citizen of Nippur, to the west gate and persuade the guards to open it.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Then, our soldiers will show the citizens the escape route and lead them on a westward course to the Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> No matter how many of the Demonic Beasts that Ushiwakamaru and the others lure away, a handful of them will catch the citizens&#39; scent.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Your job is to eliminate those Demonic Beasts. Are you with me so far?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll do our best!</p><hr><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...Sorry, one moment. Hrrrm. Ah, there we are.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Heroic Spirit or not, hesitating before the Demonic Front is a valid response, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> However, take three deep breaths. You&#39;ll still be afraid, but your muscles will loosen up.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Now listen. Our messengers in Nippur were helping us maintain contact with the city, but we haven&#39;t heard from them in the past few days.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> If you sense danger...No, let me rephrase. If you determine that it&#39;s too late, withdraw immediately.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I have a feeling you will be tasked with an even bigger mission after this.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Therefore, prioritize your own lives. That&#39;s all I have to say.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> What&#39;s this? If their lives are so precious, then perhaps they shouldn&#39;t take part in this mission at all.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> That&#39;s not what this is about. There is no growth without experience. Proper recovery leads to more muscle!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> One should always strive to face danger. I beg your pardon, but that is the destiny of those who have survived up till now.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Am I wrong, Romani of Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Even if one was incompetent in the beginning, a talent for magecraft isn&#39;t that important for traveling through the ages as a Master.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Because no matter how much of a genius one is, they are utterly powerless in the face of this cataclysm.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> And so, what&#39;s most important in saving humanity is to not avert one&#39;s eyes from hardship. That&#39;s what I think.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yes, I agree, King Leonidas.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you have come to this age as its greatest defender.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Hahaha. “Greatest”...You flatter me. Of course, I will not contradict you!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Now then, Lord Fujimaru, you must hurry. You too, Lady Mash. Do not let your guard down. Not until the very end.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been taught the basics of being a shield. The rest depends on your determination.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Thank you, Leonidas!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Has the battle already begun!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Are there more Demonic Beasts than we estimated!?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So it seems! But what has begun can&#39;t be stopped!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go with all speed too! Soldiers, guide us!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, sir! There are enough of us to escort the citizens, but the Demonic Beasts are too much for us!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> We&#39;ll depend on you, King Gilgamesh&#39;s own elite troops–the foreign warriors–to handle them!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Lord Ushiwaka! The Demonic Beasts are increasing in number! They must&#39;ve hidden behind the castle walls—Arrrgghh!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> So it appears. Don&#39;t fight individually! Close formation and tighten your defenses!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Only the Ugallu are attacking. I know they&#39;re more than you can handle, but you will NOT retreat!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Survive, even if only for a minute, and be my shield!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In exchange for your lives, I will have their heads! Every single last one of them!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Lord Ushiwakamaru, I believe that is unreasonable! Should we not retreat for now and rally again!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Nonsense! Look at the Cedar Forest! A second wave is coming!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The soldiers would never be able to make it back to the wall! They wouldn&#39;t have a chance to fight; they&#39;d only get eaten or carried off!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, I shall give them the dignity of an honorable death right here! If one hundred men are killed, we will slay two hundred beasts!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Is that not the way we do battle!? Have you become a coward, Musashibou!? How could you call yourself my Ben—</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Lord Ushiwakamaru, I...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I take it back. I misspoke. But apologies later. For now, get moving!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We are completely surrounded! With this many of them, Nippur must be empty!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> We must slaughter these beasts and hasten to Fujimaru&#39;s side!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> (Hasten to Nippur, you say...!? That&#39;s just...What am I supposed to do...!? )</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Welcome to Nippur. I&#39;ve been waiting for you, pathetic soldiers of the Demonic Front.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on here!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh. It&#39;s the same as the ruins of Babylon. Putting the old humanity aside, the city itself is innocent.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I want to leave this town as intact as possible. That&#39;s about as much sympathy as I have.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Enkidu...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Sheesh. You&#39;re so slow-witted. Maybe it&#39;s about time for me to reveal my True Name.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...What are you talking about, impostor? There should be as many as two hundred citizens here.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> There are traces of blood, but no bodies. I doubt you murdered them with your rain of spears...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I disposed of them last night, of course, but what of it? As you people said, Demonic Beasts are living beings, too.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Humans are an invaluable source of nourishment. The beasts take them back to their lairs and feed them to their young.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! You&#39;re saying they were taken back...alive!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Plus, Enkidu heard us talking!? How sharp are those ears!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Why are you still surprised? Oh, I guess Leonidas didn&#39;t explain the whole story to you.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The greatest cause of loss at the Demonic Front is soldiers simply never returning.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thus far, the Demonic Beasts have been holding back, trying to avoid killing humans where they could.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Breaking limbs, seizing them by the neck, dragging them into the forest...I don&#39;t have to tell you what happens next, do I?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> ...Th-then...it&#39;s true...We thought it didn&#39;t make sense either...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> The Demonic Beasts would cross over the Northern Wall, but they never tried to destroy it. That was just...because...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. To them, the Northern Wall was no more than a place where resources–that is, humans–were gathered.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This was never an invasion.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That plan was going to be executed after the second generation of Demonic Beasts was born.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You people are no more than raw materials used to create them. Really, you should be honored.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You are nothing more than the food that helps them grow strong. What better end could you obsolete humans ask for, hm?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> ...! Cut the crap, you bastard! You&#39;re nothing more than a cheap, bitter doll!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Gah...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I knew that from the beginning. I knew that&#39;s how you humans saw me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Well then. Now I just have to deal with Chaldea&#39;s Master, my unexpected prey...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Tell me, where&#39;s Gilgamesh? Did he send you out alone?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You want to see the king?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If you want to see him, go yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. All I did was analyze the enemy&#39;s fighting strength.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But that&#39;s fine. There&#39;s still time before Mother awakens. Shall I entertain you awhile, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You came all this way to the Demonic Front. How long can you hold out against this one? Let&#39;s see!</p><p><strong>Ugallu:</strong><br> GAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> An Ugallu! They are among the strongest of Tiamat&#39;s offspring!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> They&#39;re different than the ones you&#39;ve faced before. Give it everything you&#39;ve got, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Sorry, but you&#39;re my main target.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I had my suspicions the last time we fought. But I didn&#39;t think they would have someone like you hidden up their sleeves.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You&#39;re much scarier than the Master from Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s why...I have to get rid of you right here and now.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Ahh...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ana...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ana...!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This is bad! That wound could be fatal! Dammit, Cath Palug, do something!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I know you have magical energy stored up! Use it! NOW! I won&#39;t get mad!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...? Fou, are you—</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fuuu!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> They&#39;re gone...They didn&#39;t get eliminated so...they teleported!? What is that animal...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, it&#39;s an earthquake! Wait, no, this is—</p><p><strong>D：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Wh-what was that just now!? Did the earth shake?! Did Mt. Ebih erupt!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not it! This is...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No...She came straight here!? This wasn&#39;t the plan. Has she no restraint...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is this—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s something under the earth...!</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Lord Ushiwakamaru, this is our chance! The earthquake must have set the Demonic Beasts to fleeing!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> We can take the soldiers and retreat to the Northern Wall! Give me the order!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...No, that&#39;s no earthquake. That&#39;s the sound of something monstrous digging its way through the earth.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Monstrous...Wh-what!? What is...What is it!?</p><p><strong>D：Uruk Soldier A:</strong><br> A new type of Demonic Beast in Nippur? But I&#39;ve never heard of a Demonic Beast that big!</p><p><strong>D：Uruk Soldier A:</strong><br> That&#39;s gotta be a Divine Beast! It&#39;s bigger than Humbaba in the Cedar Forest!</p><p><strong>C：Uruk Soldier B:</strong><br> ...No. That&#39;s...That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>C：Uruk Soldier B:</strong><br> That&#39;s Tiamat! Heavens help us...The goddess of the north really was Tiamat after all!</p><p><strong>C：Uruk Soldier B:</strong><br> Run! Everyone run! You&#39;re going to get killed! We&#39;re all going to die!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Run! Run away! Run away! Run away! Everyone retreat! We can&#39;t beat that monster!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone, please calm down!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The monster&#39;s tail is over there...!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> One swish of that tail wiped everyone out! And it&#39;s blocking the gate!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Archaman, hurry with the analysis of that thing! It may be hard to believe, but that&#39;s a Servant!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Surely you can at least tell its Spirit Origin, size, and class!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m on it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Its Spirit Origin is a Divine Spirit-class, its upper body is 10 meters...and its total length–including the tail–is over 100 meters!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Its classification is Extra Class! An Avenger!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re quite loud, humans.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Mankind&#39;s sworn enemy, head of the Three Goddess Alliance, the monster feared as the Goddess of Demonic Beasts...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Prostrate yourselves, pray, and beg. Tiamat, the Mother of All Beasts, stands before you now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So...That&#39;s Tiamat...</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I trust you are well, Mother. It&#39;s so nice to finally see you awake.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...But this wasn&#39;t exactly the plan. You were to rest until the Day of Rebirth.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There was supposed to be more time before you appeared at the Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be so dull. I wanted to see what my child was playing with.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> The relics of Chaldea. Are those the bugs that still cling to the world of man?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Tiny. Insignificant. Such fragile, frail creatures.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I do not understand at all. How did life like yours come this far?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> You are unworthy of tormenting, of killing, even of my gaze. Even your taste is nothing but disappointing.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...But rejoice. For I am very hungry right now.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Even worthless lives like yours should still be tasty. Will humanity&#39;s last Master be sweet or bitter?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tiamat is scowling at us...I can&#39;t...move!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Neither can I! Not at all! This...This is bad...!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Is this fear-induced paralysis? Or some sort of Mystic Eyes? It&#39;s...it&#39;s so powerful it even works on me!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Deep breaths, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right! Deep...deep breaths!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Deep breaths, Merlin! Through your gills!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> “Gills”? What do you mean!? But I guess I get it. “Merlin” and “merman” are mortifyingly similar!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right! Now&#39;s not the time to get scared! She might be a goddess, but why worship such an evil being!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash! Trust your Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No matter who you&#39;re up against, you&#39;re still alive right now! And you have the world&#39;s greatest swindler, Merlin, there with you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, run to the Northern Wall! It&#39;s too early to give up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Right!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Of course! I&#39;ll do what I can, Master!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I see. So lively. At least that is...interesting.... Very well. Step back, my child. I will handle this.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I will crush humanity&#39;s hope as if I were plucking a ripe strawberry...A fun and sweet end for you, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand at all. This is the first time I&#39;ve felt baffled.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Even with life as fragile as yours, you still have all of your limbs attached. That makes no sense at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see any damage to Tiamat! The second we wound her she regenerates!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that the Authority given to her in the Mesopotamian creation myth as mother of the Demonic Beasts!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not an Authority of a goddess. She&#39;s regenerating from the Holy Grail&#39;s supply of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I just confirmed it. That Servant has the King of Mages&#39; Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Oh? It seems you have a knowledgeable one with you. That is indeed what I possess.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> But don&#39;t make light of me. I am not using the Holy Grail&#39;s magical energy at all. I have manifested as the Goddess of Demonic Beasts...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t use power from elsewhere to destroy the humans.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I am using my own power, my own hatred, my own anger, and that&#39;s enough to destroy you three times over!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ugh...We&#39;re practically useless against a goddess&#39;s Authority, and now she has a Holy Grail, too!?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Now...I&#39;ve had enough of this nonsense. You will die screaming! Playtime is over!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Run, everyone!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s only one hundred meters to the Nippur gates! But we won&#39;t make it! She&#39;s just too big!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re not going to make it! We can&#39;t even get out of her arm&#39;s reach! ...At least, I need to get Senpai out of here!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You&#39;ve done well in holding out this long! Leave the rest to me, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Ushiwakamaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Run to the gates and don&#39;t look back! I&#39;ll hold back that monster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where&#39;s Benkei!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> He couldn&#39;t keep up with me! ...Tell him not to worry!</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine, Lord Fujimaru. Please be cheerful. Victory won&#39;t come to those who cannot smile.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In my past life...Minamoto-no-Yoshitsune&#39;s life, I didn&#39;t have that. Thus, even in victory, I kept losing until the end.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That sort of end wouldn&#39;t fit you.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Another bug, huh? You&#39;re an eyesore! I will crush you!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ridiculous! You&#39;re no Miyamoto. You cannot catch a bug with that body of yours!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> How dare you run on top of my tail!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That serpent form has gotten the better of you!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The Wandering Tales of Shana-oh, Act Two, Usumidori: Heavenly Blade Steps! Taste my sword!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> How DARE you wound my face with your blade! I won&#39;t forgive you. Begone!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (This is useless. I can&#39;t even run through the skies without any ships. )</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (It takes a master to grab a fly with chopsticks, but anyone, even Lady Masako, could hit such a beast with a sword. )</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> (I never thought I would be done in by a snake&#39;s tail. I seem to have come to another pathetic end...)</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru! Master, Ushiwakamaru is...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, don&#39;t stop! There&#39;s been no change in Tiamat&#39;s signature!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s catching up to you with incredible speed...! She&#39;ll break through Nippur&#39;s wall soon!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s where you were, insects. I&#39;m not letting you get away.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I may have lowered myself into the form of a Demonic Beast, but I am still a god. Don&#39;t try to make me a liar.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> What a persistent goddess, just like a snake! I suppose that&#39;s rude to snakes, though. They don&#39;t act out of resentment!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> You don&#39;t stop talking, do you, mage? Very well. I will crush you first.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Heh. Try it if you can! Take this chance to run away,Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t mention this before, but I&#39;m immortal. After all, I&#39;m half-incubus.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The second this body is smashed, I will reappear in the world of dreams!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But I&#39;ll need some time to return, so let&#39;s decide on a place to meet! How about the king&#39;s—</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hold on! Wha...? Wait. Could this be...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Immortal due to powerlessness? In that case, it&#39;s been a while, but I&#39;ll use my eyes.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I&#39;ve collected enough human statues, but a statue of a half-incubus might look good in my temple.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The Mystic Eyes of Petrification!? Dammit! My one true weakness!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Sorry! I take it all back, Fujimaru! Protect me, whatever it takes! Defeeeeeend me, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I can&#39;t explain it, but it&#39;d be REALLY bad if I lost consciousness!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If I get turned to stone, everything we have done here will be for naught!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> If I must...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I was planning on it from the get-go!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! Leave it to me, Master! We&#39;re almost to the Northern Wall...We&#39;ll get away any way we can!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I see. So you can block my Mystic Eyes with your shield. You&#39;re being extremely reckless, girl.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> My tongue dances. My lips drip. My blood boils with past humiliation.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> You humans will be sacrificed. My Thousand Mystic Eyes will turn the fortress and everything around it into ash!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Such desperate measures...How odd...It seems it was a mistake to underestimate you.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I suppose you were powerful enough to overcome six Singularities. Enough even to stop me breaking you down in one breath.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...However, I will kill you all. Every single one of you must die at our hands, down to the last child.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Scatter! Flee, you pathetic creatures of flesh! The beasts of Kur will devour you! The lives you&#39;ve ended scream for your blood!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Silence, monster! Your fixation on pure brutality rivals even the king of Persia!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Speak and be heard if you have grievances! My three hundred soldiers and I will give you a chance to do so!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Here goes! My friends, bring your souls hither! Thermopylae Enomotia!</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Fuuuuuu...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...Good. It seems I somehow made it here in time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Leonidas! You rushed over here from the gates!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No. This can&#39;t be.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...It was unavoidable. Our protection is simply sturdy shields.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Sturdy, yes, but nothing like the shields wielded by legendary heroes. And so, of course, we can only block physical attacks.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...Which is why I was able to deflect your heat ray. Does that shake your old bones, Greek goddess?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Monstrous, accursed creature, transformed by Athena, and loathed by all, murderer of many heroes:</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> You are the monster born from the sisters of the Shapeless Isle. No...The composite deity, the Great Demonic Beast, Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...So it&#39;s King Leonidas. You deflected my heat gaze, and spoke a cursed name.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> But because it was you, O King of Flames–you who discarded nothing, even when you yourself were abandoned–I will charge you with no other sins.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> At least die a hero. You needn&#39;t see the end of the human world.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...Heh. That is not possible. Just like my soul, the human world is immortal.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Just as you have, the human world will inevitably end.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> The world&#39;s most powerful protector has died for NOTHING! What better proof could you ask for!?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Raise your voices, Demonic Beasts! The time has come!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> I myself will assault Uruk and kill the king! Unleash your hatred, and trample down the humans who escaped!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What the...!? That&#39;s Tiamat!? ...Or is it Gorgon!? Jeez, this is so confusing!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She was so focused on Fujimaru earlier, but now she&#39;s not paying any attention to [♂ him /♀ her].</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s planning on just advancing with the Demonic Beasts!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s unfortunate, but it seems so. Perhaps King Leonidas&#39;s words calmed her down...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Like a human trampling ants underfoot, she will continue from here towards Uruk.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Right now, we have no way to stop that. Just pray that she doesn&#39;t stomp us down on a whim.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This...This can&#39;t be...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru and King Leonidas saved us, yet we can&#39;t do anything about this?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Please wait. Isn&#39;t that a little short-sighted, Mother?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Conquering Uruk is only a small step. Isn&#39;t the real issue the other goddesses, rather than the humans?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The alliance is dissolved once Uruk falls. The second generation is reserved for those coming battles.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> 100,000 offspring await birth in the Blood Fort. Until they&#39;re born, the Three Goddess Alliance must continue.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Besides, ending it like this won&#39;t be satisfying.... We should take our time tormenting humans.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> They took away the beasts&#39; land and young. They oppressed Mother. They forgot everything...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Flames of hatred do not burn without a target. You cannot possibly discard hatred so easily.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Mother, you are no longer a Greek goddess. You are an incarnation of Tiamat, a god of Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So, please think it over. Return to your Blood Fort.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Be grateful of the restraint my son shows, humans. However, your fated destruction still looms.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Ten dawns from now, we will destroy Uruk. If you value your lives, flee to the ends of the earth.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> If you can escape, that is. Over 100,000 of my Demonic Beasts will come to life in my temple.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Merely killing you off won&#39;t be enough. So, try to save yourselves, if you can.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> When you&#39;ve drowned in terror, abandoned your comrades, gone mad from doubt, and become mere beasts, THEN I will grind what remains of you to dust.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Whew. Thankfully, she retreated. Life is hard when you have such an unreasonable parent.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That&#39;s one thing we have in common with humans. Children can&#39;t choose their parents. Don&#39;t you think so,Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s the meaning of this?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The meaning? I just saved your lives. I mean, it&#39;d be so disappointing if this was the end, right?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> For Mother, you are all vermin that need to be exterminated. In truth, she needs to focus on the other goddesses.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And the other two goddesses seem to be utilizing humans effectively.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So, if we just slaughtered all the humans, those two would be...upset.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I serve Tiamat. So, to ensure things go smoothly, I&#39;m keeping humans alive a bit longer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What in the world are you?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, I don&#39;t need to hide that any longer, either. I, like the Demonic Beasts, am a creation of Mother.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> A prototype of the people who will rule the world in your place, replacing you archaic humans who abandoned her.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> A new breed of humanity created by the great Tiamat, the primordial goddess. My True Name is Kingu.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Kingu...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s the name of the god that led the Eleven Offspring of Tiamat in the creation myth!</p><p><strong>G：Kingu:</strong><br> Right. But I&#39;m not a reincarnation, or anything stupid like that.</p><p><strong>G：Kingu:</strong><br> That Kingu was a failure who feared Marduk, and fled. There was no need to revive such a coward.</p><p><strong>G：Kingu:</strong><br> But, I am different. I am a perfect being, modeled after Enkidu, the greatest masterpiece of the gods...</p><p><strong>G：Kingu:</strong><br> I was designed as the perfect, new human.</p><p><strong>G：Kingu:</strong><br> So, I guarantee you. Humans will not go extinct. Humanity will be reborn right here, with me.</p><p><strong>G：Kingu:</strong><br> After you old humans die out, I will be the first of the new humans. We will take over and continue with your history.</p><p><strong>G：Kingu:</strong><br> So, rest assured as you are annihilated. The last salvation you are given is the joy of returning to the void.</p><p><strong>G：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Lord Leonidas, the commander who never stopped defending this Northern Wall, has passed away...</p><p><strong>G：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> The Demonic Beasts keep coming...And, our enemy is Tiamat...</p><p><strong>G：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> This is truly the end...In ten days, Mesopotamia will fall to ruin...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...There you are. So...Lord Leonidas is indeed gone...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...I am going to take my leave as well. Please give King Gilgamesh my apologies for not meeting his expectations.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Benkei, why!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...I...Well, I failed my master once again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...About Ushiwakamaru...</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Indeed.</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> When that Goddess of Demonic Beasts appeared, Lord Yoshitsune rushed out to save you without a second look.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> However, I could not do that.... It wasn&#39;t that I couldn&#39;t catch up to Lord Yoshitsune.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> It was that I faltered, even if only for a moment.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I was no match for that goddess. I protected myself, thinking there was no way I could win against her.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> As a result, I sent Lord Yoshitsune off alone yet again. I fled from my lord as she rushed to her final battle.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...I was a coward unfit to be Musashibou after all. Now, I can no longer see the point in fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s not true! We need your power, Benkei!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...You overestimate me.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> The only fate fit for a fool like me is to die in some ditch in the wilds, fighting Demonic Beasts...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s gone...He left for the ruins of Nippur, where Ushiwakamaru fought...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Seems so. His dropout hurts our combat strength, but if he&#39;s not motivated, there&#39;s nothing we can do.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We might as well tell a soulless corpse to fight for us. We need to seek warriors who can fight, not those who can&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t look at me like that. Even I can understand Benkei&#39;s feelings.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But...look over there.</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Idiot, what&#39;s with the sullen looks!? Tiamat is gone, but the Demonic Beasts remain!</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Which means there&#39;s only one thing to do! Look for survivors, rescue the injured, and regroup!</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Guard the fortress, replenish our weapons, train those muscles! That is the everyday life Lord Leonidas pounded into us!</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Ugh...! No matter when, he never made a single complaint!</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Even when facing the jaws of death or in an inferior position, he never abandoned his will to act!</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> “I&#39;m not saying you should fly. Take some bricks, and line them up here. ”</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> “It&#39;s something anyone can do, and it&#39;s the most important thing. ” He did that until the very end!</p><p><strong>G：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> That&#39;s...that&#39;s......You&#39;re right. Right. That was the pride of this land.</p><p><strong>G：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t just the pride of Lord Leonidas. It was the pride of every one of us...!</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Now, we will regroup the squadron right away!</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> That monster only melted away part of the rampart. Drag out the resident construction squad and begin repairs!</p><p><strong>H：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Tell the engineers everything that happened! We need to prepare for further attacks!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone...They were all in such low spirits, but now...!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah. They swallowed their terror and stood up. We can&#39;t afford to be depressed, either.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. There are people out here that aren&#39;t crushed even after seeing that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way that Musashibou Benkei wouldn&#39;t stand up after seeing them behave like that.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah. He just needs time for now. He&#39;s sure to return.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Until then, we need to proceed with our countermeasures. We first need to regroup with Ana, since Cath Palug teleported her somewhere.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Then we need to return to Uruk and report to King Gilgamesh. We lost a lot this time, but also gained a lot:</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The Demonic Beast Goddess&#39;s True Name and true nature. Kingu, claiming to be its son. And the whereabouts of the Mage King&#39;s Grail.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> With this much information, we can think of the next step. The situation is finally turning around.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We&#39;ve seen nothing but defeat until now...It&#39;s about time we get a counterattack going.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Fujimaru of Chaldea? I&#39;ve noticed how you love to make a comeback in the second half.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Of course. We&#39;re just getting started!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! I&#39;ll accompany you, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If possible, I&#39;d like to win from the start!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. That&#39;d make us feel a bit better. But in order for that to happen...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...we&#39;ll need you to mature a little more!</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Where is this...I haven&#39;t disappeared yet...My body is fine. But my limbs...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...They&#39;re fused with the wall. I can neither flee nor die like this...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> ...? Forward? I just need to keep going forward? If I do, I can get outside?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. When you leave the temple, there will be a lake. Use normal cedars, not the black ones, to guide your way.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> What happens after that is none of my concern. But you should be able to survive for ten days or so if you stick around the lake.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> You can head to the city and try to avoid the Demonic Beasts, or you can breathe your last there at the lake. Do what you like.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> ...Yeah. Thanks, mister. If you&#39;d like, please come see us.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That was...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Oh, are you awake already? I expected nothing less from a Servant. You&#39;re as tough as a Demonic Beast.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Green hair, beautiful features...You must be Enkidu. This is the first time I&#39;ve seen your face.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Still, what a horrific sight. If this is your home base, I suppose you&#39;ve taken me prisoner because you plan to do...THAT to me?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re quick to understand. As you can see, this is a factory of sorts.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Tiamat&#39;s Demonic Beasts are all created from one maternal body. But that alone has its limits.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> So, if it&#39;s greater numbers and a wider variety of species we desire, what we truly need is a larger “womb. ”</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> This temple was created for that purpose.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> One piece of flesh creates about three Uridimmus. On the other hand, three pieces of flesh only yield a single Ugallu.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I see. You call them Tiamat&#39;s offspring, but this is horrible.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In the end, they weren&#39;t even soldiers. For you, they&#39;re nothing but expendable tools.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Ugh...!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Oh, sorry. My hand slipped a bit, and I seem to have spilled some of your guts. But you&#39;re all right, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Yes, yes. Both of us were a bit too careless.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Me, my hands that move so easily. You, that cheeky mouth of yours. You should watch that.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Though, soon enough, you will be just like them.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Once we plant an egg in that stomach, you will begin to change, however slowly.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The saving grace is that the brain morphs last. You will be yourself until the final moment.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Oh, so I see both you and this so-called mother are fools. Leaving the consciousness intact until the very end is the poorest plan.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Every single one of them must have fought to the very end, even after the transformation was complete. All you did was give them strength to fight.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You&#39;re not wrong. But it&#39;s nothing you need to worry about.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Those that become materials melt away from the extremities. In the end, their limbs end up like maggots.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> And after you turn into nothing more than slimy goo, you are tossed into each Demonic Beast&#39;s adjustment tank.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You can resist all you want. Fantasize about it to your heart&#39;s content. We&#39;ll let you dream that much.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...I see. For all that, you seem a bit...lax.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Why did you let the children escape? I thought you only let us dream?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> A difference in values. I don&#39;t have any grudges like Mother.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I only kill threats. I kill human soldiers because they could potentially be threats against me.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The young ones...The children will not be threats. So, there is no need to kill them here.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But there&#39;s no reason to keep them alive, either.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Whatever you may think, you heard the voice of that child calling for help, and answered it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> How strange from the enemy of humanity. Trying to act like a demon, yet unable to embrace complete cruelty.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You know what folk like that are called? Clowns. They are ridiculed on the battlefield as such.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...I see. It seems like a special treatment is required for you.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> No egg for you. Instead, I&#39;ll take you to see Mother.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The true Authority of Tiamat is the “sea of life. ” Those that fall into that sea become Tiamat&#39;s child as they are.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Servants are no exception. Frankly put, it&#39;s a kind of black mud that corrupts any Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Primordial life. The sea of chaos. In the world of magecraft, it is called the mud of the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The King of Mages named this the Chaos Tide.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I&#39;m looking forward to it now, Ushiwakamaru. What kind of monster will you become?</p><h2 id="section-10-good-morning-goddess-of-venus" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10-good-morning-goddess-of-venus" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 10: Good Morning, Goddess of Venus</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;ve gone through your report. You have been through a lot, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Sacrifices are unavoidable in war.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As king, I will prepare the memorial for the lost, and compensate those left behind. None of you need worry about that.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Gorgon, wielder of the Authority of Tiamat, will begin attacking in ten days! Are you certain, Merlin!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a day since then, so nine days to be correct. First, let&#39;s review what we know.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Gorgon, the monster known for killing heroes in Greek mythology.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She&#39;s here either because of the King of Mages&#39; Holy Grail or due to some twist of fate.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Whichever it is, the Grail has restored her former appearance and power.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> While many legends tell of the monstrous Gorgon Sisters&#39; murderous exploits, none depict any of them giving birth to other monsters.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Therefore, the Authority to give birth to Demonic Beasts, Potnia Theron, must have come from the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who are the Gorgon Sisters?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Three deities in Greek mythology: Stheno, the oldest; Euryale, the middle sister; and Medusa, the youngest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They used to be rural goddesses, but the youngest Medusa angered the great goddess Athena of Olympus.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In her wrath, Athena transformed Medusa into a monster. Medusa&#39;s sisters took pity on her, and together the three moved to a remote island called the Shapeless Isle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, the people, influenced by Athena, saw all three sisters only as monsters. So, they sought to kill them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> After defeating many heroes who came to kill both her and her sisters, Medusa truly became the monster everyone believed she was. She even devoured her beloved sisters.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably how this “Gorgon Monster” was born. It&#39;s a manifestation of the primordial goddess that possesses the divinity of the three sisters.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does that have anything to do with Stheno and Euryale?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. There were three divine Gorgon Sisters in Greek mythology; those two were the oldest and middle sisters.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The youngest sister, Medusa, was persecuted by the people, killing many heroes who came for her head.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The ceaseless violence, the prejudice and persecution all drove her mad, and eventually she devoured her beloved sisters and became an enormous monster.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph. So an exiled goddess returns as a goddess of vengeance, huh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If anything, I&#39;d say she should destroy the Greek world instead, but I&#39;m sure that would be a bitter pill to swallow even for her.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Then? Did Gorgon say humans have no chance against the goddesses from the very beginning?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. She says we humans are just an obstacle, and that the goddesses are the only ones she needs to watch out for.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. Mash, what are you disappointed for? This is where you should be laughing.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ahh, such hopeless fools they are. That gives us ample opportunity for victory.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-is that so?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course it is. Right, Fujimaru? You feel the same, do you not?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Heh, of course.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahaha! Of course you do! Strife among enemies is the most entertaining weakness there is!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But aren&#39;t you quite nasty yourself, Fujimaru? You&#39;d better take a long look in the mirror if you ever want to make any friends!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Heh, I...guess?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Curses, so you&#39;re some little Goody Two-shoes! Sit right there. I shall educate you in the art of ruling and dominating your foes!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> According to your research, the three goddesses are each very different.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Gorgon has the greatest influence, and runs on the hatred of humans.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Although the Goddess of the Jungle has covered Ur and Eridu with greenery, she has not done anything to the people.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Also, this goddess isn&#39;t particularly assertive. She has no hatred, but she is not lazy either.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She uses what&#39;s necessary when necessary and carefully reads the situation. She&#39;s perhaps the most perfected goddess of all.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The third goddess is the one hard at work destroying her own land of Mesopotamia...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ishtar...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Hm. Well, that sounds about right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh? The look on your face is saying Ishtar is not a foe. It is fine, do not mind me.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If you feel that way, you may be right. She wasn&#39;t taken into consideration in the first place anyway.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well, there is no point in highlighting that woman&#39;s faults now. I&#39;m tired of it anyway.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What I want to point out is the order in which we defeat them. Negotiating with Gorgon is not possible, but the other two are different.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Which means Ishtar should be first. That should be the most manageable opponent.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> My king, are you commanding us to defeat Ishtar? I cannot agree to that.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> No matter how much damage Ishtar causes, she is still Uruk&#39;s patron deity. To fight her would be...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How disappointing, Siduri...Even Fujimaru understands...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Huh...? U-um, what do you mean by “understands”...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ishtar is bad, but she&#39;s a good goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ishtar is a pain, but she&#39;s not a bad goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...All of the victims&#39; stories agree that Ishtar always and only attacked when there were Demonic Beasts involved.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In light of that, we believe she was trying to protect the farms from the Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying Ishtar robb—I mean, confiscated the farmers&#39; fortunes because she was claiming a reward for protecting them? ?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Then Ishtar was only protecting Uruk out of pure good will!?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> No, not out of good will. It&#39;s more her “Because everything in this world&#39;s mine” type of thinking.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Do you see how that&#39;s just her usual foolishness? That woman can never give up Uruk. That&#39;s where her weakness lies.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So we&#39;re gonna defeat Ishtar first? She&#39;s not as strong as Gorgon, but she&#39;s still very powerful, you know?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Who said anything about defeating her? There&#39;s no need to defeat that fool.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We are going to bring her over to our side. Like taming a wild beast.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And of course, that means that our heroic Fujimaru shall be that beast tamer!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Finally, a job for a hero!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ugh, great. Wouldn&#39;t want it to be easy or anything...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So you&#39;re saying we have to persuade that super wild and reckless goddess...But, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just defeat her?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it is more productive than fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai has contracted with many Servants up till now. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll manage.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...King Gilgamesh. I&#39;ve heard you fought with Ishtar many times.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Yet you want to become allies with her? Aren&#39;t you two on extremely bad terms with each other?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course. And making her an ally doesn&#39;t mean that will change.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ishtar cannot be of use to humans. She&#39;s useless no matter how much power she has.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Er...Then, um, why?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fujimaru can contract with her. I don&#39;t have particularly high hopes for her.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, her Bull of Heaven, Gugalanna, is another matter entirely.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s a lethal weapon that, if used, could incinerate a city in an instant. We will definitely need that to end this war.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Therefore, we will make her our ally. Do you have anything to say, Merlin?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No, no. If that&#39;s the case, then I have no objection. It&#39;s good to have a playful mindset like that, my king.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;d call it gambling more than being playful.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Bringing that woman in is like loading a jar without a cap onto a cart.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ah well. Now, onto the details of the plan. All right, Fujimaru. For Ishtar...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And so, we left Uruk with some goods to use for negotiating.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ana, I haven&#39;t greeted you properly after reuniting. Let me say again how happy I am to work with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Glad you were okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Glad to see you again.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes, nice to see you again.... And...At Nippur, I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be of much help...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Not another word of that, Ana. We should only reflect on failures to try and learn from them and improve. Never simply dwell on them!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, look at Merlin up on his high horse...It&#39;s not like he could be bothered to be helpful. At all. Don&#39;t worry about it, Ana.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway. So you&#39;re headed for Mt. Ebih, huh? It&#39;ll be your first mountain climb since arriving at Uruk.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, after Ishtar flew out of Uruk, she made herself a temple on Mt. Ebih that she claims as her territory.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The mountain trail will be harsh, but you should be able to get there in about a day. Well, but before that...Roman, you can say it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, it&#39;s just as usual. But it&#39;s not my fault, so please bear with me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got some enemy contacts, everyone! Think of it as a warm-up before you head into the mountains!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is Mt. Ebih...Looking up from the base, it seems steeper than the other mountains.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it looks like proper paths have been built. I was expecting to have to climb up sheer cliffs.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. Mt. Ebih was the tallest magical summit–or rather, spiritual mountain–in Sumer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even An, the greatest of the Sumerian gods, feared it. His daughter Inanna was obsessed with it, however, and to her he said this:</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> “Ebih is a fertile mountain. Its blessings are great, and it is deep. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> “My dear Inanna. Only a fool would disobey Mt. Ebih. ”</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes. And that warning angered Inanna–that is, Ishtar–even more.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ishtar took all her weapons, and headed for Mt. Ebih, bringing a storm behind her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She tore apart the mountain as she walked along its edge towards its center.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course, it was a spiritual mountain that even the gods feared. Ferocious creatures, volcanoes, rivers, and cold winds struck at her.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> And each time, Ishtar complained.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> “Toxic mist, raining boulders, burning lava! I can&#39;t believe it! What kind of welcome is this? ”</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> In her mind, the fact that she was the one trying to destroy the mountain didn&#39;t matter at all. She is mankind&#39;s oldest example of victim-blaming!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foou...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mt. Ebih&#39;s mistake is that it didn&#39;t send all its disasters at once. It kept hoping the next thing it did would get her to leave.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It sent its storms out bit by bit. Now, Ishtar was selfish, but adversity only made her stronger.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At last she reached the top of Mt. Ebih,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> “And the goddess grabbed Mt. Ebih by the neck, and stabbed her blade deep into its body. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> “Mt. Ebih fell apart, its huge body sliding down like a drop of water. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mt. Ebih collapsed to half its original size, and Ishtar&#39;s aspect as a goddess of war became common knowledge.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s interesting is that through all that, Ishtar didn&#39;t use her bow.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In fact, she took the trouble to walk all the way up to the summit and drive a lance into it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She...She walked...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Drove...her lance...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I know it&#39;s too late, but I&#39;m a little worried. Can we really talk to a goddess like that?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s believe in King Gilgamesh&#39;s secret plan. He&#39;s probably feeling overwhelmingly low about now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I wish he&#39;d negotiate himself...</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s a bad idea. Ishtar would never agree to King Gilgamesh&#39;s demands.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He can&#39;t neglect his kingly duties, anyway. Not because of psychological reasons, but from the sheer amount of work.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He&#39;s handling the leadership and military command of not only Uruk, but all of Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> There&#39;s also preparations to be made for when the Northern Wall falls, and when Gorgon attacks.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> There&#39;s not much hope to get his help in battle during this Singularity. Even now, he&#39;s more at risk of dying from overwork than he would be in battle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s true...I keep forgetting, but King Gilgamesh is from this era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s got a vast amount of magical energy, but he&#39;s not as sturdy as a Servant. We can&#39;t put him through too much.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...A king doesn&#39;t fight anyway. Those kings who do fight are weird.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ana, you shouldn&#39;t say that. Or some very complicated people might complain!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, yes. It&#39;s a very serious “too many kings” problem.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Anyway, guys, enemies sighted!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They&#39;re probably demonic statues placed by Ishtar to guard the mountain.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Each one has the magical energy of an A-ranked Servant! Stay sharp and engage them!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That was horrible...I had no idea Ishtar&#39;s aesthetic sense was so bad...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes...I didn&#39;t realize she was such a disappointment as a goddess...Maybe if we just leave her alone she&#39;ll self-destruct...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Everyone, stay strong. Look over there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s...Ishtar&#39;s temple!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! It&#39;s very clearly an attempt to brag that,“I conquered Mt. Ebih! ” But still, it&#39;s impressive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s go home.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru, you mustn&#39;t run from things that are unpleasant.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I think it&#39;s clear that we&#39;ll have to fight Ishtar. Let&#39;s just accept it and press on.</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So, you just waltz right through the front door like you&#39;re here on a sightseeing tour, huh, Fujimaru? Rude!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You just lost to the Goddess of Demonic Beasts, and now you&#39;re visiting me?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...You&#39;ve got some nerve. I&#39;ll give you that.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Not only did you enter Mt. Ebih without my permission, but you defeated my guards and entered my temple.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Until now, I&#39;ve overlooked what you&#39;ve been doing because you&#39;re a country bumpkin outsider, but not anymore.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Your shameful acts in Babylon, your favoritism towards Gilgamesh in Uruk, that game of cat-and-mouse in Kutha...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but as a goddess, I cannot in good conscience allow you to go on like this. The gods have their own rules, and a goddess only forgives three times...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What I&#39;m trying to say is that I&#39;m done talking! If you&#39;ve come here, a fight&#39;s what you want, right?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> There&#39;ll be no amnesty or mercy for you. It&#39;s just as you wished.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make you use all your Command Spells, and then blast you all the way back to Uruk!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar is ready to fight! Master, what do we do...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to show our strength first...!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru is right, Mash. Ishtar does not listen to the words of the weak.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Let&#39;s show her our strength...by breaking her knees. Also, maybe her arms.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s no point in talking with her anyway...!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No, Fujimaru, there are some things you just shouldn&#39;t say!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m actually of the exact same opinion, but let&#39;s try and make our lives easier by flattering Ishtar!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Okay, that does it! I am one hundred percent DONE playing the nice goddess!!!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I am the goddess of war, and the goddess of Venus! Taste the power of Ishtar, most fearsome of all goddesses!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Not bad! That&#39;s what I&#39;d expect from humanity&#39;s last Master!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Forget humanity and the responsibilities of a goddess! Now I&#39;m getting into this! I&#39;m kicking it up a notch!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, before that...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I have something you&#39;ll want to hear...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Come on, don&#39;t get a girl all hot and bothered...Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to surrender!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it, Ishtar! Master has a suggestion!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. You see...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ishtar may not look it, but she&#39;s the greatest of the Sumerian goddesses. As Inanna, the “Queen of Heaven”...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She once ruled the heavens in the god An&#39;s place. She would never lose in a battle of strength.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s the example of Mt. Ebih, too. The more you push her, the more she&#39;ll show her guts, even if she shouldn&#39;t. That&#39;s who she is.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But she does have a weakness.... Gems.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I gather all of mankind&#39;s treasures, but she goes crazy over gems.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And this is the most important point: She lacks what&#39;s called the “Golden Rule. ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She loves gems, but has no luck when it comes to obtaining them. Until now, she&#39;s had gods and men offer them to her.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But now there&#39;s nobody making offerings to her.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You know what that means, right? You can just buy her off.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I will entrust you with thirty percent of the rare jewels in my treasury.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Negotiation is the most important skill a contractor can have. Go buy me a Goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We actually have an offering for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh? An offering? As if a commoner like you could possibly have anything to interest me.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m not interested in some random knickknacks you picked up off the ground somewhere—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, do the thing!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right! ...Here we go.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wh-what! Is that a giant cart full of lapis lazuli!? A crown? Is that the seven-jeweled crown!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> This is enough to power my magecraft for a long time...No way. You&#39;re giving them to me!? What are you, a god!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No take-backsies! Also, I don&#39;t have to pay tax on these, right?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh wow, I&#39;m getting all dizzy. Okay...calm down, me! Also calm down, Ishtar-me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Everything in this cart is a deposit. It&#39;s all yours. Right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. This is just the deposit, Ishtar...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Indeed. A deposit! All this!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> A...A deposit...!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> In other words...(Gulp)In other words...? (Gulp)</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We would like to hire you to help us. This is the wish of all the people of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> As proof of this, King Gilgamesh promises to open the treasury of Babylon for you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fujimaru, tell her the total sum.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We offer you 10% of the treasury&#39;s jewels.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We offer you 20% of the treasury&#39;s jewels.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> WHAT. DID. YOU. SAY!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou! Dofoooooouu! (Special translation: This goddess is easy! )</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Quiet, Fou. I know what you want to say, but quiet.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> N-no, wait. It&#39;ll take more than that to make up for my years of anger.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re talking about the treasury Gilgamesh is building for the future, right?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Once completed, it&#39;s been touted to be bottomless...Or...Or that it contains ALL mankind&#39;s treasures!!!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And I get a huge fraction of it? That sounds too good to be true...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How about 25% then?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s still going up!? And I get 25%!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. 25%.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s one out of every four, Ishtar.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Ugh...But I&#39;m the almighty Ishtar. I can&#39;t just...from such shameful conditions...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, do the thing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So negotiations are over then...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, Master. I understand. I shall take it back as our own.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, wait. No, oh no. Don&#39;t do that. Don&#39;t do that. It would make me so sad I would just DIE!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;ll it be, Ishtar?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please make your decision.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Give it up already. There&#39;s only good things in it for you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If the whole world&#39;s destroyed, nobody will be left to adore your beauty.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even the concept of beauty itself–developed by humans and applied by you gods–will disappear. That&#39;d be a shame.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But if you make a deal with Fujimaru, then this conversation will change.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You will go down forever in history as a pure, righteous goddess.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I-I see. That doesn&#39;t sound bad...(Glance)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, um, you know...If the whole world is incinerated, um...(Glance)</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou! (Special translation: She&#39;s staring! Staring at the jewels! )</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That wouldn&#39;t be much fun at all...(Glance)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...(Gulp)</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Okay! If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll accept!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You win, Fujimaru. I&#39;ll accept your conditions and join you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ve gone back and forth on it for so long that the world could have ended seven times over. I think that&#39;s enough.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That took all of two minutes.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s how long it was in your time! In my mind, in GODDESS TIME, I went through a whole psychological adventure!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Silence is golden. )</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Goddess Ishtar...! So you&#39;ll fight to help the people of Uruk?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Just call me Ishtar, Mash. I think this is the start of a long and profitable relationship for me. Oh, for you too.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> People will think it&#39;s weird if you keep calling me “goddess. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay! I&#39;ll call you Ishtar then! Thank you for your help!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know we&#39;ve had our problems so far, but let&#39;s put that behind us!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes. Okay, Fujimaru, first start by kneeling and kissing the soles of my feet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...? Um, what does that mean...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m still a Servant. If I&#39;m going to side with humans, I need to properly form a contract, you know!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So I need to establish a relationship with Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> As for who&#39;s the Master and who&#39;s the Servant...Well, I&#39;ll leave that to your imagination.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-no! I refuse to allow that! That method of contracting isn&#39;t in the manual...!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And so, even though it is only a temporary contract,I have honored you by becoming a Chaldean Servant!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do whatever you want, as long as it doesn&#39;t bore me, okay☆?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wow...First Miss Artemis, now Ishtar...That&#39;s the second time we get a real goddess Servant, huh...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, now&#39;s not the time to be worrying about that. Let&#39;s go over the basics.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ishtar. You&#39;re a Pseudo-Servant, right? As in you use a human body as a vessel?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Divine Spirits can&#39;t normally be used as human familiars. The difference in scale between us is just too great.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And since it&#39;s so different, you can&#39;t come here from the world you moved to.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> With the Age of Gods over, Divine Spirits simply watch over human history. This era is no different.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The reason you&#39;re able to manifest as a Servant is that you&#39;ve possessed a human you&#39;re compatible with...Is that right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So compatibility is important. Do you mean Magical Circuit quality and innate talent?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s important, of course, but what&#39;s also important is the shape of the soul, so to speak. What kind of person they were.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If they&#39;re like me, Ishtar, then they&#39;re compatible.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But what about it? You&#39;ve got Pseudo-Servants with you too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, we&#39;ve seen several during our travels through the Singularities, but never one like you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You seem to have been summoned into this era. But how did that happen?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, that, huh? Honestly, I&#39;m not sure myself...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What I do know is that the Matron at the Sacred Temple in Uruk tried to summon me.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But she was doing it in a really roundabout way.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Since Uruk was about to become a Singularity, it was able to connect with different eras.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Normally, time and space are paired together, but Singularities can cross over them both, right?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So I guess she found a mage girl who was compatible with me in some era or another, and summoned me into her.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> At which point, I became a Pseudo-Servant, and the Temple Matron forcibly summoned me to the land of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, because of how it was done, I don&#39;t really remember what happened around the time I was summoned.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The next thing I knew, the Matron had died from draining herself of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> When I went outside, the path that connected Heaven and Earth–the thread that had barely held on from the Age of Gods–was gone.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Gilgamesh built the fortress cities and said that humanity could get by on its own, so gods weren&#39;t needed anymore.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Do you know how confused I was when I saw that? I felt like shooting everything in sight with my bow.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I can sympathize...a little. Only a little, though.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re not in a position to talk, are you? Ana, was it? You need to clean up after your own mess, okay?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I know. So please don&#39;t talk about it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. That explains a lot.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, it wasn&#39;t Solomon&#39;s Grail that summoned you. It was Uruk&#39;s Sacred Temple.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But that leaves one problem.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As Chaldea&#39;s representative...No, as a doctor...I have an ethical problem with this.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on with the girl you possessed? Are you in total control of her?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Really? You created a Demi-Servant like Mash, and now YOU want to talk to ME about ethics?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have a good response to that...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But my mistake and your problem are different matters. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Humph. That&#39;s a good answer. I&#39;ve changed my opinion of you a little.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll answer your question. If you&#39;re asking if I killed the owner of this body, then no.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If you&#39;re asking if her mind can take control, that&#39;s a “no” too.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She and I have become one. Right now, it&#39;s about a 70/30 ratio with me as the majority.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> When a Divine Spirit and a human become a Pseudo-Servant, the Divine Spirit has more spiritrons, and therefore the main personality is me.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, the original me, Inanna in the higher dimensions, isn&#39;t as humanlike as my current form.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But neither of us is more important than the other. I&#39;m always going to be me, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I can only possess a person who&#39;s capable of seeing things that way anyway.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So think of it this way.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s not that this person was taken over by Ishtar...It&#39;s that she suddenly became the new Ishtar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. I don&#39;t get that at all.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine. I&#39;m still not sure which of us is which myself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that girl is not asleep...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes. I am “me” when I speak to you. It&#39;s like two personalities merged into one.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway! I&#39;m saying that I&#39;m me!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Now that I&#39;ve got a new contract, it&#39;s time to say goodbye to this mountain!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I had nowhere to go in Uruk so I built a temple on Mt. Ebih, but there&#39;s really nothing here.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The mountain range is cut open like a cake. We&#39;re so deep in the mountains that no worshippers would come visit.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Not even a cute deer. Only a forest full of venomous snakes!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I know I was the one who chose this place, but I&#39;m really not sure why I did.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> ...tar...I...sh...ta...r...</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Af...ter...all you...have done...Un...for...givable...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Sorry? Who are you?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> I...will...defeat...you...Now die...demon...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, a mysterious rock is attacking...I sense something sad, but let&#39;s fight it!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yay! Ishtar&#39;s off her mountain and all&#39;s right with the world! We all made it off Mt. Ebih!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Something showed up at the end there, but let&#39;s forget that!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I feel bad for Mt. Ebih...Next time we come, let&#39;s be nice to it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now, now. It was our first battle together with Ishtar. Let&#39;s not think about who or what we fought.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> More importantly, Mash, it looks like there&#39;s an abandoned house nearby. Let&#39;s have you all spend the night there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that, Doctor. Is that all right, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take first watch.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hmm...You guys are veteran travelers, huh? You even take turns standing watch.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Have you ever had the experience of sleeping anywhere outside your bedroom, Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If you haven&#39;t, feel free to stay up all night and keep watch while we sleep.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Sorry, but I&#39;ve spent plenty of time outdoors. I used to sneak out behind my father&#39;s back all the time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And as long as I have my boat, I&#39;m good. Sarcasm aside, if you want me to keep watch, I will.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That would be great. Actually, I didn&#39;t expect you to be this cooperative.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> After all that&#39;s happened so far, I thought you didn&#39;t like humans.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re not wrong there. I&#39;m mostly nice to them so I can surprise them later.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Humans exist so they can be bullied for my entertainment. No matter how much of a softy I am at heart, I&#39;m still Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I...see...Let&#39;s be careful so that we don&#39;t end up like Mt. Ebih.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I actually find that reassuring, though. The goddess Ishtar needs to be cold-hearted.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> After all, she&#39;s our trump card against Gorgon. We need her to perform just like she does in the myths.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. With Ishtar on our side, we stand a chance against Gorgon now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha! Actually I don&#39;t think you will lose to anything at all! She&#39;s not called “the most powerful goddess in Mesopotamia” for nothing!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ahaha! Tell me more! Flattery will get you nowhere, but don&#39;t let that stop you!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hmm, but wait? Why do you think that?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I mean, we&#39;ve always ended up in a draw. Besides,I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done anything amazing in front of you yet.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh come on. It&#39;s the Bull of Heaven! The divine weapon you received from the god An!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even King Gilgamesh recognizes its strength! So when the time comes, you can use it to destroy Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Since that doesn&#39;t count as fighting her yourself, it shouldn&#39;t violate the pact of the alliance.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m told it&#39;s a devastating weapon that changes the very terrain itself, so we&#39;ll keep it as a weapon of last resort.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, um, yeeeah! Th-that&#39;s right. You guys get it. It would be a weapon of last resort. Haha.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> By the way, I decided I&#39;m going to be keeping a diary starting tonight, so I&#39;ll let Fujimaru handle the watch after all.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Bye! Have fun!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar took a blanket off the cart and ran into the house.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Heheh. And she says she&#39;s used to sleeping outdoors.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fo?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You haven&#39;t let someone else take over yet? You really care about your Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want Mash to get as much rest as possible.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hmm...Mash is the Servant with the shield, right? You&#39;ve had a contract with her for a long time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can still do another hour.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s almost dawn. Nothing good comes from pushing yourself too hard.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The more you push yourself, the more people around you will think it&#39;s normal. It&#39;s best to do only 80% of what you truly can.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Then again, if you could have done that, you wouldn&#39;t be here now. It has to be hard to look like you&#39;re fine when you&#39;re always at your limit.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Can I sit next to you? I think it&#39;s time we had a little chat.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Um, what is it?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Nothing. I was just looking.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I still can&#39;t believe you brought ME to your side. It&#39;s so unexpected a girl just has to stare a bit, you know?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Or what, was it love at first sight? Are humans from the future always that filthy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, uh, I mean...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I know. I&#39;m joking. Sorry, I was just teasing you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah. Chaldea lives in the future.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> H-huh...You&#39;re not denying it...Humph...I see. So what you&#39;re saying is...there&#39;s a chance.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Hold that thought. It&#39;s actually kinda cold wearing something like this...Ah...Ah...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Achoo!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So anyway, back to what we were saying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> !?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What the heck!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...What was that? Did you just try and run away from me?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No, you did, didn&#39;t you? I saw you start to back away. I&#39;ve seen it many times.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...I see.... Are you scared of me too?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...No, it&#39;s the sneeze just now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...So that kind of Authority exists too! )</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Really? You&#39;re really not scared of me? You don&#39;t hate me because I&#39;m a goddess?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s no reason to hate you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even if you&#39;re a goddess, you&#39;re a terrible one.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I-I am not terrible! I&#39;m just merciless! I don&#39;t like gore and stuff!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Wait, that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here. There&#39;s no time, so I have to get to the point.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You plan on fighting the Three Goddess Alliance. What do you really think about them, though?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The Goddess of Demonic Beasts...Well, there&#39;s no helping her. She&#39;ll never make peace with you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The Goddess of the Jungle...I don&#39;t know much about her. Our cultures are very different; what&#39;s good in hers may be evil in ours.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She&#39;s the descendant of a different celestial body, after all.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And the third goddess...That&#39;s me, obviously...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I won&#39;t forgive Mesopotamia for what it&#39;s become.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I refuse to accept that you humans abandoned the gods and tried to make your own world.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s going to bring you nothing but misery. Humans can&#39;t escape the suffering of life or the terror of death.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You humans became smarter. Too smart. And all so that you could come to accept the world for what it really is.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But in the Age of Gods, that pain can be lessened, because there are things there that humans can&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You can blame all the bad things, the crazy things, in your life on the gods, and that makes life easier.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I really thought that way of life was a good thing. I took that blame for tens of thousands of years.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s why...I joined this alliance. So that “your” world could become “our” world...A world for both gods and humans.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m not an enemy of humanity, I&#39;m an enemy of humanity&#39;s world. I&#39;m only telling this to you, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t realize...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re actually nice, huh, Ishtar?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Th-that&#39;s all I wanted to say! F-for tonight, anyway.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway, good night! I&#39;m going to bed! Don&#39;t you stay up too late!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good night, Ishtar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good night, goddess.</p><hr><h2 id="section-11-hello-goddess-of-the-sun" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-hello-goddess-of-the-sun" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: Hello, Goddess of the Sun</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

There&#39;s no need to say who the real winner is here. And when that happens, this is what you&#39;ll be screaming:</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> “Oh, Ishtar! You truly are the goddess of victory! I am so very, very ashamed. Guess I&#39;ll have to kill myself! ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m not going to die, you fool! I even liberated Eanna, your resting place, and you haven&#39;t repented at all!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Of course I haven&#39;t! I&#39;m actually really mad! Eanna was mine to begin with!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So why&#39;d you steal it!? Argh! I knew I shouldn&#39;t have come!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Please, both of you, stop.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> The patron deity appears before us...For a priestess such as myself, there is no greater honor.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Let us forget about the damage report from the farmers, as well as the other things, and celebrate her return.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph. You heard her, Ishtar. The High Priestess says so.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Tch...I can&#39;t be bossy around Siduri...She&#39;s the most faithful of the Uruks, and the ideal priestess...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It looks like Ishtar isn&#39;t able to push Siduri around.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> From the look of things, maybe King Gilgamesh and Ishtar will be able to work together!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well, whatever. We can deal with rehabilitating you later. We have more pressing issues.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Pressing issues...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You mean the Goddess of the Jungle?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Now that we know Gorgon is an incarnation of Tiamat, we have a powerful weapon at our disposal that we can use against her...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The axe of the god Marduk, who ripped open Tiamat&#39;s throat, is still kept within Eridu.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This axe will be the key to defeating Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Eridu...The first city in Sumerian mythology where the divine right to rule was given.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But now it&#39;s covered in jungle. I see, so that&#39;s why...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I told you, there&#39;s an order in which to defeat the goddesses. First Ishtar. Then the one in the south. Then the one in the north.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So, how about it, Ishtar? I bet you know who the Goddess of the Jungle really is.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Many of the heroes I&#39;ve summoned so far have gone into the jungle, trying to learn exactly that. None returned.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Only a very powerful Divine Spirit could defeat such Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not Jaguar Warrior?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Of course not. That&#39;s also a Divine Spirit, but it&#39;s only a secondary one. Next time, I&#39;m skinning it for its pelt.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good...So it&#39;s not Jaguar Warrior...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So we can just ignore her, then? Personally, I&#39;m relieved.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> After all, if she were one of the three goddesses, I have no idea how we&#39;d deal with her!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m curious about Jaguar Warrior, but talk about her later! ...So? What is the True Name of the Goddess of the Jungle?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Well, I guess I could tell you that.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The goddess that holds dominion over the south is the “Winged Snake”...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> A fellow goddess of Venus, and the great bird of the sun. The wind of Mesoamerica! Quetzalcoatl!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl! The conquering King of the Mayans? The Toltec sun god?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s demiurge caliber! She might be even more powerful than Gorgon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, wasn&#39;t Quetzalcoatl male, anyway!? Why&#39;s she a goddess?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right. Humans wouldn&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The place you call Mexico–the region of Mesoamerica, that is–has a very different mythology.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Their gods are said to not be from this planet, but to have come from the sky.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> When an asteroid collided with Earth, “something” that came with it survived and infected the plants...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Eventually it became a microscopic organism that changed the local animals into “gods,” and built that area&#39;s civilization.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The deities of Mesoamerica move from one human to another. One of those vessels was probably a female.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Th-thank you for that incredible information, goddess! There&#39;s still so much about Earth we don&#39;t know!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl...Hmm...With human history incinerated, I can&#39;t see the future of this Mesoamerica you talk about.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Doctor Roman! Gather information on this goddess!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I know nothing of any deities who were able to come back to life in the A. D. era!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! Master, that felt like an earthquake just now!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Forgive me, my king! An urgent message from the south gate of Uruk!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> The south gate has been annihilated! They&#39;re requesting reinforcements!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...An enemy attack!? What were the lookouts doing!? How could they miss a horde of Demonic Beasts?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> They say...it&#39;s a single enemy!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> A woman calling herself Quetzalcoatl has destroyed the gate with her bare hands and entered Uruk!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> She&#39;s heading straight for the ziggurat!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier A:</strong><br> Get the citizens out of here now! She&#39;s coming! She&#39;s charging in!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier A:</strong><br> Spearmen, form up in three rows! If ten soldiers won&#39;t hold, attack with thirty!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier A:</strong><br> You in the rear, press forward! We&#39;re going to force her back with everything we have!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldiers:</strong><br> Raaarrrgh! We&#39;ll put an end to your killing spree right here!</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> Mm, you&#39;ve got spirit! But this isn&#39;t a tag team match, no!</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> I said one at a time, no? Naughty kids who can&#39;t wait their turn...Hmm...What to do...</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> I know! I&#39;ll juggle you till you cool off! Okay, uno, dos, tres...!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldiers:</strong><br> Impossible! She&#39;s tossing the soldiers about like toys!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldiers:</strong><br> Oh no! That&#39;s too high! She&#39;s throwing them too high! They&#39;re gonna...! Nooooooooo!!!</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> Oh my. You&#39;re terrible at plancha, and also terrible at landing? You won&#39;t be top-tier luchadores like that, you know!</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> Si, in lucha libre, it is important for both the attacker and defender to nimbly break a fall!</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> You got that, niños? Before you learn any techniques to defeat others, you must learn to protect yourselves...</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t do that, you&#39;re no match for me, no matter how many of you there are!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier A:</strong><br> Nnnnnno good. Everyone, retreat, retreat! We are no match for her!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier A:</strong><br> Wait for the warriors of Chaldea! Until then, until then...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier A:</strong><br> ...Until then, we&#39;ll do as she requests! ...You said you won&#39;t complain if we go up one-on-one, yes!?</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> Claro! Try to pin me for a three-count, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have arrived at Uruk&#39;s southern market! As King Gilgamesh ordered, we—</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Over there! Oh, look out!</p><p><strong>D：Cheerful Voice:</strong><br> How unfortunate! You&#39;re so tiny! Muy pequeña!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> W-waaah! For some reason she came diving in spread-eagled!?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let her...Soldier, get out of here! Hurry!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Y-yeah!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Wow! Qué técnica! What an amazing aerial attack! I&#39;ll give you forty points, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But you stole my opponent! So rude, yes! That match wasn&#39;t decided yet, no?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Interfering in a luchador match is against the rules!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Mm. So. That. Means.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Wha...Wind coming from below our feet!? Waaaah, it&#39;s lifting us up!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The penalty will be...My one hundred meter ring-out toss! Adiós, muchachos!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Waaah! I&#39;m...faaaaaalling...!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> ...Wait, I&#39;m alive!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ana, nice catch!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ana, nice moves with the chain!</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Hurry and retreat! We&#39;ll take care of the rest!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Y-yeah...! Thanks, we&#39;ll leave it to you, cutie!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hmm. Is it against the rules for someone to show up and catch a falling luchador?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I think it is...Buuuut if the audience loves it, I guess it&#39;s okay!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> After all, we don&#39;t fight to kill our opponents...We fight to give courage to the people!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Aaaanyway, are you my next opponents?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Good, you&#39;ve got some pep! I&#39;ll fight each and every one of you till your hearts give out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that&#39;s the Mesoamerican goddess, Quetzalcoatl...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...She scares me, Master. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She is laughing like she&#39;s having a great time! A laugh with no hatred or animosity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yet, she isn&#39;t hesitating to kill...It&#39;s insane! I don&#39;t know what to do!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Indeed...We&#39;ve never seen anything like her before!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (She&#39;s killing people...? )</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Talk later. She&#39;s coming! Your enemy is the highest-ranking Divine Spirit there is: a true goddess!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s not like Gorgon who used the Holy Grail to become a goddess, nor a Pseudo-Servant like Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Everyone, proceed with the utmost caution! Staying alive is more important than defeating her!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our attacks aren&#39;t doing anything...! It seems she possesses some kind of special skill...!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Oh, are you guys Servants?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Then, is that cutie over there the Master from elsewhere?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Indeed. That&#39;s Fujimaru from Chaldea, the last Master of humanity.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s late, but I&#39;d like to confirm. You&#39;re Quetzalcoatl, from the Three Goddess Alliance?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Claro que sí!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m the big sister who came all the way from Mesoamerica to destroy Uruk a little, yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Destroy Uruk “a little”...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why do such a thing!?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Why did you clam up like that? That shouldn&#39;t be a difficult question...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Ahaha. You, Master of Chaldea, are my type, so I was just a bit surprised, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Disciplined, righteous, and earnest. That hits all my buttons! So much so, you deserve a penalty!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If Fujimaru will marry me, I don&#39;t mind being on your side!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> MAAAAAARRY!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What did you just say!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> (Hahaha, this goddess is weirder than anything I could imagine! The story is getting complicated now! )</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ay no. After all, that would be a bit childish. Goddess-ish, but childish.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Now. Why destroy Uruk? I&#39;ll at least answer that question.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s because we were called over by Mother to kill humans.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It is our purpose here, and we can&#39;t change it. So, that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But, how I do so is up to me, no? It&#39;d be boring to just drop the sun and burn everything, no?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes! I want to have fun. I don&#39;t want to fight out of hatred. Sooooo...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I decided that no matter who I&#39;m against, I&#39;ll kill them one by one, and that&#39;s how I&#39;ll eradicate humanity, yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Seriously, in a fistfight!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Dios mio, through lucha wrestling!?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Sí! So I won&#39;t use my Authority as a goddess! Because that tires me out, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Objection! Great goddess Quetzalcoatl, I&#39;d like to point out that you used your Authority in our battle!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s cheating!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m cheating? Hehehe...Being scolded by a younger Master is a first. Makes me blush!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But you need a trial like this. Just going easy won&#39;t help anyone grow.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That&#39;s how you learn, yes? Humans are like that, yes?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So she wants you to find her weakness during the fight...! But no matter what we do, that divinity is—</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Oh, relax! See, I&#39;m going back soon, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I only fight one hundred people a day! Any more than that, and I start forgetting my opponents.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t want to make fighting a chore, no! Death matches should always be of the highest quality!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So, everyone, adiós! I&#39;ll be back tomorrow at dawn to kill another one hundred of you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl is disappearing into the jungle, riding a pterosaur that flew by...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Are you...safe now? No, I see another Servant approaching!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This...This magical energy...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oof, oof, oof! Sheesh, Kuku works jaguars so hard.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Transporting warriors she knocked out. Why is she making her best furriend do this?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> That ludicrous hooded guise...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mystery Servant, Jaguar Warrior...!</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hey, guys! It&#39;s been a while! But hold on a sec, I&#39;m working right now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha...Jaguar Warrior is stacking the fallen soldiers one after another onto a cargo sled!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s going to take them away! Master, we need to stop her...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, stop it right there, Jaguar Warrior!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I knew something was pouncing around in the background!</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Whoa. Stop and leave the goods? I will not, no! That&#39;s not how the world works. Reality is harsh, you know.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Kuku is ruthless! She never holds back when she punches me!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> So do you really think such a cold-blooded bird would forget to assign bodyguards for a mission this important? ...Oh...I guess she did...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> So, the forest furriends that I cherry-picked will protect me! To me, my great Jaguar Underlings!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warriors:</strong><br> Roarrrrr!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Whew! Look at these sturdy Jaguar Underlings! Boys and girls...we&#39;re not letting you sleep tonight...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m going home and drinking a Tequila Sunset while eating crocodile! I&#39;ll leave the rest to mew guys!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The jaguar-headed warriors are attacking! Master, your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm, well this is an altogether new problem. To think Quetzalcoatl would come barging in herself.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What a nuisance! If she keeps tearing up the city, that&#39;ll affect morale on the Demonic Front!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> The craftsmen and soldiers have left the southern market. At this rate, the king&#39;s little side project will...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Side project...? King Gilgamesh, what are you making?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...No. Nothing.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> (Sigh) Siduri, must you be such a killjoy? What&#39;s the point of making a secret weapon if it&#39;s not being kept a secret...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ugh, this is all because of that insane goddess! Ishtar! She&#39;s one of yours!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Make yourself useful! Do something about her!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hey, she&#39;s not one of mine! She&#39;s from a completely different culture!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Really?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Really. She&#39;s a different class and uses different weapons. Other things like the amount of skin showing and our alignments are generally the same.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (So that means the two get along, Senpai! )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Shh, stay quiet...! She&#39;ll just get distracted. Even if it&#39;s true, don&#39;t mention it, Mash! )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You think so?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We&#39;re totally different! There aren&#39;t that many muscle-headed goddesses like her!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou? Foufofo, fofofofooou?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Well, there&#39;s no denying that she&#39;s a nuisance.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Like the way she picks fights with humans one by one. She&#39;s got a weird idea of eradicating humanity, but I guess she&#39;d call it integrity.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And, if she&#39;s coming tomorrow, that means she intends on killing one hundred people every day.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Yes. Exactly one hundred soldiers fell victim. The corpses were carried off, so we can&#39;t even bury them...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even if we wanted to fight, we&#39;re no match for her. Don&#39;t you have a plan of some sort, Dr. Roman?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Eh? You&#39;re asking me!? You guys have Merlin over there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Use that clairvoyance or whatever, and take a peek at what Quetzalcoatl is doing!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;d really like to do that, but I can&#39;t overuse my clairvoyance. I&#39;m using my magical energy for other things right now.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> At any rate, she&#39;ll definitely pick up on it if I observe her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And as many a myth has shown, goddesses don&#39;t respond well to being peeked on. Isn&#39;t that right, Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yeah, I&#39;d kill them. I&#39;d use my Authority, my Noble Phantasm, everything I have, and blast wherever the peeper is to oblivion!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> See? Do you want to piss her off like that? I don&#39;t! And THAT&#39;S why I can&#39;t use clairvoyance to check out Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. I wish you&#39;d told me earlier that you were restricting your clairvoyance.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No wonder something seemed a bit off about you, Merlin. You had already done everything you could.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you understand. So, Romani Archaman, what is your proposal?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, I shall give my opinion as Chaldea&#39;s operations commander.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Currently, there is no way to intercept Quetzalcoatl. That said, we aren&#39;t in a condition to leave her alone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Which means we have to get proactive. We strike at Quetzalcoatl&#39;s home base.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Originally, Quetzalcoatl was a goddess that had absolutely nothing to do with Sumer.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So how is she demonstrating such heightened Divinity and Authority?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It must be because a temple dedicated to her worship was built somewhere.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The other day, when Fujimaru went to investigate Ur, there was a particularly strong magical energy response coming from the south.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even in a jungle full of mana, that response was so strong you knew it was special.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That must be Eridu, the city that King Gilgamesh was talking about. If Quetzalcoatl is occupying that city,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> we can assume that she has created a temple in her name there. To establish a temple, you need a symbol that represents the deity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl is said to possess two treasures: the Jade Sword, Macana, and the Sun&#39;s Pilgrimage, Piedra del Sol.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Either of those would certainly work to establish her place of worship. So...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Destroy the symbol, remove the temple&#39;s power, and diminish Quetzalcoatl&#39;s Divinity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Exactly, Ana. After that, if we face Quetzalcoatl, there is at least a small chance of victory.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And with Ishtar&#39;s help, we&#39;d be more than a match for her.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re relying on me?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to fight other goddesses, but if it&#39;s Fujimaru&#39;s request, I have no choice.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Of course, if it was a certain useless king asking, I&#39;d just have laughed myself silly and refused!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...(Grinning)</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...He totally sees through her...There&#39;s no way Ishtar can win this one...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s settled, then. Fujimaru, I have a new mission for you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I authorize the second stage of our goddess extermination plan! Go through the jungle and head to Eridu!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There, defeat Quetzalcoatl, and also recover the divine tool stored in Eridu.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Retrieve Marduk&#39;s axe, the weapon that killed the goddess Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Two days to reach Eridu, four days round trip!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hurry! As soon as you return, we&#39;ll start preparations for the battle with Gorgon!</p><h2 id="section-12-temple-of-the-sun" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12-temple-of-the-sun" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 12: Temple of the Sun</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Operation Defeat Quetzalcoatl begins now, Master. Let&#39;s head to Ur first.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, gatekeeper. Here&#39;s the seal from King Gilgamesh permitting our departure.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, thank you. Please have a safe trip.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> You&#39;re...the gatekeeper that was on duty when we first came to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> This south gate was attacked by Quetzalcoatl...but are you all right?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Haha...Well it&#39;s embarrassing to say, but I wasn&#39;t even taken as an opponent.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Did you know that these past few days an unknown disease has been infecting people in Uruk?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. I hear the old and weak are the first to die.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> I had the same symptoms as them. Didn&#39;t have an appetite for three whole days.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> So when that goddess saw my face, she said, “Don&#39;t push yourself. Want a mango? ”</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Mango? You mean the fruit, mango? I&#39;ve heard of it...But it existed in this age...?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, and it was very tasty! Almost the instant I popped it in my mouth, I felt better! Thanks to that, I was able to resume my duties as a gatekeeper.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And you just ATE it!?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Hahaha, yes I did. That&#39;s one of the reasons I came to be stationed here at the south gate. Everyone&#39;s scared of this gate, you know.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> So, um...I&#39;m not so sure that the Goddess of the Jungle is actually evil, really.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure this is just bothersome to hear, but if you meet her, and it looks like you can speak with her...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Before you exchange blows, please try to talk to her. Maybe there&#39;s a way to solve this without fighting.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s what the gatekeeper was saying, but...is it even possible to speak with Quetzalcoatl?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It might be.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It isn&#39;t. She WILL attack us, so be ready to defend yourselves.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be there to fight with you this time. Just watch closely and see which goddess is the more powerful one.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> If I were just a little taller...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Taller? Senpai, you&#39;re really not that short...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fofoou.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A talk with Quetzalcoatl, eh? It&#39;s true that there may be a way to avoid battle.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She said she would eradicate humanity because her mother called her here to do so.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Which means that she&#39;s not against mankind of her own free will.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Though that does raise the question of who this “Mother” is.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...If she says, “Mother,” then wouldn&#39;t it be the Goddess of Demonic Beasts, Tiamat?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, if you think about it, that does makes sense...How about it, Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Did Gorgon order you two to exterminate mankind?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh? I couldn&#39;t care less about the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl is a winged serpent, right? Maybe she&#39;s just helping out Gorgon because they&#39;re both snakes?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (...Ishtar isn&#39;t interested in the Three Goddess Alliance...? No, wait...This odd feeling, could it be...? )</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahaha! Meowhahahahahahahahaha! I mew you&#39;d come back to my jungle, my prey!</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> If Kuku returned to the jungle, then you guys wouldn&#39;t be far behind! That is common sense!</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> And ambushing prey on the flank is the jaguar&#39;s hunting style! Meow it&#39;s time to snack, hup!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, it&#39;s Jaguar Warrior. Here she comes, down from the trees...as always.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, your stealth abilities are to be expected in the jungle. With all the magical energy surrounding us, I couldn&#39;t detect you at all.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> However, Quetzalcoatl is still the principal deity in Mesoamerican culture.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No matter how much power Gorgon gained from the Holy Grail, Quetzalcoatl wouldn&#39;t serve her without cause.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Just like the gatekeeper said, she probably has a reason. Leaving this “Mother” problem aside, it&#39;s a good idea to try and talk to her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, talk. Conversation is the best expression of human sincerity and kindness, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mmm.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mmm.</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Jeez, that&#39;s not convincing at all!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you see that, right meow, there&#39;s a teary-eyed goddess being ignored in front of you!?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> No. After witnessing Quetzalcoatl&#39;s Divinity, you seem like no more than a paper tiger.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Aaaaaand you&#39;re dead. I&#39;ll put an end to this thousand-year war between light and darkness!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> You humans have no tomorrow! Why? Because it&#39;s only natural that the weak perish!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> There is no good or evil in that! If you want to live, be strong! Meow that&#39;s the paw of the jungle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior is now in battle mode...! And what she&#39;s saying actually makes sense!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Humph, it&#39;s too late to notice meow. I&#39;m not takin&#39; it easy, baby! It&#39;s purrvival of the fittest here, and you&#39;re not looking too fit!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What, is that all you got? Meowhahaha! It doesn&#39;t hurt! Not a scratch!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, no! I shot her. You guys told me to shoot her, so I did...But is that really okay?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Of course. She&#39;ll probably never learn her lesson unless we kill her, so we had better do it at least once.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hey! You! You know that Servants die when they are killed, right?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> As a fellow Rogue Servant, mew should know what it&#39;s like!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> A once-in-a-lifetime miraculous summon, but with no Master? I am the brown-striped, cat-eared Jaguar Warrior, who dreams of getting a real job...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;m no goddess, but I&#39;m still a Nagual god! Shouldn&#39;t you guys show me at least a liiittle respect!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What!? That thing is a Rogue Servant!? I totally thought she was Quetzalcoatl&#39;s minion...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;m not a minion! Kuku and I have just been stuck with each other!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have a Master, so I&#39;m just freeloading off of Kuku for meow!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I see, so you&#39;re just a leech!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fujimaru! The more allies, the better!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She may not be that bright–or, well, altogether sane–but that Servant is good in a fight! You know what to do!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Roger!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t have much confidence, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I heard everything, since I have four ears! I&#39;ll CATch any kind of sound!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> However, an amazing opportunity like that is impawssible! Let me make that clear!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I am a very proud wild jaguar, I will never work under somebody!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But I will give you a chance. I&#39;ll at least listen, so give it a shot.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It may be late in the game, but you&#39;re so beautiful...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Now that I see you, your beastly beauty is enchanting!</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Aaand done! I&#39;m your ally. I&#39;ve just become your ally right meow!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I know, I know! Defeat Quetzalcoatl, right? Just leave it to your big sis!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> This tiger will give you all the deets on Kuku, from her bedtime to when she wakes up!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Negotiations were successful, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior became our ally and it only took a single sentence to convince her!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Righto! And that&#39;s how I, Jaguar Warrior, will move from the jungle to a modern environment like Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be in Fujimaru&#39;s care starting today! Nice to meet you all☆</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru, that was the worst move possible...If Merlin hadn&#39;t said anything...I will kill him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I look forward to working with you, Jaguar Warrior. I am Senpai&#39;s official Servant, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> R-right. You offered a handshake with a smile, but I know you&#39;re a pretty scary girl though!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Nice to be working with you, Mash! And you too, familiar-looking loli gal!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...You brought in another noisy one...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, she isn&#39;t even pseudo-contracted, so we could cut her off anytime if necessary...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But she is definitely a good informant for us. The jungle is her backyard after all.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Let&#39;s have her guide us from Ur to Eridu. And she can tell us all about Quetzalcoatl along the way.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Leave it to me! To Eridu, right? I&#39;ll guide you at top speed!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Grrr. Won&#39;t. Let. You. Why. Did. You. Betray. Us. Jaguar Warrior!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...! I&#39;m detecting multiple hostiles! You guys are surrounded!</p><p><strong>Werejaguar:</strong><br> You. Forget. Pride. Jungle! Humans. Visitors! Humans. Intruders!</p><p><strong>Werejaguar:</strong><br> Humans. ATM! We. Guide. Them! You. Taught. Us. But. You. Betray!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Teehee☆ It&#39;s the Sumerian Beastmen I&#39;ve been lying to this whole time.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Sorry guys, I went ahead and changed jobs. I found a new Master.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...By the way...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ya remember I told ya a million times to not touch them civilians!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-whaa!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Miss Jaguarmura!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, why are there mafia-style modern clothes underneath your fur!?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> You just do whatever you feel like don&#39;t you!? Knock it off already!</p><p><strong>Werejaguar:</strong><br> B-boss...! But. You. Fallen! Get her!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Tch...Too bad. I guess these are the tagalongs that aren&#39;t cool with me moving on...Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have to take out my own minions...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Sure, bring it on! It&#39;s a good opportunity to show Fujimaru what I&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> My club can be vicious. Be prepared, &#39;cause you ain&#39;t gettin&#39; crocodile meat ever again!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> So, we&#39;ve arrived at Ur.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I know it was a wild trip, but I appreciate Fujimaru&#39;s kindness for not asking about my minions!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, there wasn&#39;t much to ask.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Poor Werejaguars...)</p><hr><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> A-aren&#39;t you guys from the Chaldean Embassy!? Did you come to rescue us!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, you&#39;re all the soldiers Quetzalcoatl took away! You&#39;re alive!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even after she tossed you so far into the air, and beat you so brutally?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Y-yeah. Oh yeah, we have to explain it from there...We were surprised she didn&#39;t kill us, too...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Uh-huh. At a glance, it looked as though they were being murdered, right? But she wasn&#39;t killing them.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Well, she is actually killing them, but right after giving them a killer move, she&#39;s casting a killer revive on them. That girl.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> It&#39;s Kuku&#39;s bad habit, or kind of like her policy? I personally don&#39;t get showing mercy in a match like that.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> She takes on anyone who&#39;s ready to risk their lives to challenge her, but she helps those who aren&#39;t ready to die.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s why she gets taken advantage of by Tezca. And yet she still just doesn&#39;t learn.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> As a big sis, I&#39;m worried that the other goddesses will walk all over her if she doesn&#39;t change.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew it...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you knew already, Senpai...I&#39;m ashamed of myself...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So there&#39;s zero casualties...?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh yeah, a report delivered to the king mentioned that as well.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Besides the soldiers who were taken, there were no casualties among any of the soldiers that were involved.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...But it looks like you&#39;re all locked inside Ur...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. That weird goddess is preventing us from returning to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Because you guys are our dear sacrifices! You all gotta become Kuku&#39;s soldiers when the time comes!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I see. Does that mean Quetzalcoatl is taking these men to build herself an army?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. They&#39;re getting retrained in Eridu. That girl may look cheerful, but she has experience as a king.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Did you know she&#39;s super good at commanding an army? So why don&#39;t you guys stay and fight here too?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> We are soldiers of Uruk! We cannot stay away from the city, not even for a day!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Everyone else is preparing for the end of the world, doing what they need to do without any rest...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now, now, don&#39;t say that. Ur is pretty fun too. The residents look a little down, but that&#39;s not important.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> There&#39;re two kinds of people! The ones who can make it, and the ones who can&#39;t! That doesn&#39;t change no matter what era we&#39;re in.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But, that&#39;s why humans have thrived for a long time☆ If each and every person could work THAT hard, it&#39;d be kind of scary.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> “There are ones who can fight, and ones who cannot. ” “That difference in capacity is a trait seen only among human society. ”</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s what Kuku was saying. Well, it doesn&#39;t matter to me though.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Kuku...So you were talking about Kukulkan.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl was the priest-king of the Toltecs. To the Mayans, he was the conquering king, Kukulkan.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl was a god, but also appeared at times as a king of men.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So that goddess may be inheriting all of that memory and history...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She&#39;s very busy for a goddess...I wonder if all the gods of other lands are workaholics like her...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It means she&#39;s not quite like Gorgon. She understands what human beings are, but chooses to destroy them nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s complicated in itself, but how about it, Fujimaru? You think you&#39;ll be able to talk to her?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I do, yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know.</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hmm, I think that&#39;s impossible. Gorgon is the goddess of the north, right?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl is also a goddess of war. If she shows her true self, she becomes much more terrifying than Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Kuku is a monster who enjoys fighting. She sounds cheery, but that&#39;s because she&#39;s in a good mood.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But imagine what&#39;ll happen if the fun is taken out of it. All she&#39;ll be is a cold killing machine afterwards.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Words alone could never defeat Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The only thing that could silence her would be a head-on battle of the soul.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s almost time to trade shifts...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...My romantic interlude sense is tingling!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Good evening. On guard duty by yourself again? Here you go, something to drink. It&#39;s chilled fruit water.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you. Please, have a seat.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Sure, I might as well since I&#39;m here. Umph.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So Ur turned out to be like this, huh. Compared to Uruk, though, the people are kind of morose.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...But this is how things are supposed to be. Not all humans are strong.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> There are people who try, but it just doesn&#39;t work. That&#39;s not because they&#39;re not brave enough, or they&#39;re weaklings.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> They&#39;re just not fit to do certain things.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Gilgamesh and Quetzalcoatl don&#39;t understand that. No, they don&#39;t even try to understand it.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If only the strong and glorious are accepted in this world, the weak and frightened ones will have no place.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m not saying you need to protect them because they&#39;re weak. It&#39;s just that some things can only be seen from their perspective.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to ignore that fact. I want everything to be fair.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ishtar, you&#39;re fussy.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> R-really? I didn&#39;t realize...But it&#39;s true I don&#39;t like dirty things.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Although, I love bones...I don&#39;t like animal guts and stuff like that though.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior said the same thing.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Jaguar Warrior, really...You recruited another new Servant again.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, I don&#39;t really care. Maybe just a little irritated, that&#39;s all.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, whatever. Anyway, I actually came to advise—Ah, ah,</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> achoo!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I came to give you some advice tonight. To plan against Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Hey. Were you trying to run away again when I was trying to be nice and tell you something?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s just my imagination? The fruit water is good? ...O-okay, if you say so...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway! Listen carefully to my suuuuuuper helpful advice!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ready? She is a god of good, the apex of all things good. If you think about it, that means nothing good can work on her.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The only things that could really harm her would have to be evil. That&#39;s why if you get into battle, use an evil Servant to fight against her.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That way, you&#39;ll at least be able to fight better than before. No matter what happens, just don&#39;t rely on me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ah, I see...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You sure are a goddess!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes, of course! I am the greatest and wisest goddess of Mesopotamia!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But aren&#39;t you a little naive?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> W-well...Maybe just a little.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m usually at the temple, so all I knew of the outside world was what I&#39;d heard.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I was given a job as soon as I was born, so I didn&#39;t have any freedom...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re seriously the first person to have a conversation with me like this as a friend...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t turn a blind eye, so I&#39;m helping you out like this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m honored to be your very first friend.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can&#39;t turn a blind eye to you either.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I-is that so? I...hadn&#39;t thought about that. But maybe it&#39;s not so bad to have a friend...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Gasp! ) D-did someone just see us together!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou? Foufofofooou?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Oh, it&#39;s just a small animal...Wait, that&#39;s the Beast of Disaster again!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> How could you bring that dangerous thing around...? That&#39;s a spiritual beast that feeds off of human greed, you know!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you know that if you toss him into a village, he&#39;ll grow into an uncontrollable monster in a year?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If it hasn&#39;t been that long since you had him, I won&#39;t say anything bad. Hurry up and throw him into some molten lava or something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But it&#39;s already been a year.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is this true, Fou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Foufoufou (Whap, whap)</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t hit my cheeks like that! Okay, I got it, you want me to get back, right!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway, I gave you my advice! I&#39;m going to bed now!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I can&#39;t be of much help, but do your best in your battle with Quetzalcoatl, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good night, Ishtar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Good night, my goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooooou?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> We made it, meow! Behind this jungle&#39;s veil lies Eridu!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I can feel Kuku&#39;s death aura just twenty meters ahead!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s been two hours since the sun fell from its zenith. Current time on our modern clocks: 3 PM.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It seems that Quetzalcoatl has returned from her attack on Uruk...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...What a pain. Our plan was to disable Quetzalcoatl&#39;s temple before fighting her.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Now that Quetzalcoatl has returned, that throws everything off.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The irony is, in order to weaken Quetzalcoatl, we need to defeat her first.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmm. It&#39;s difficult for us amateurs to move through the jungle. You can&#39;t blame us for using up half a day just to get here.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fujimaru, now you have to decide when to execute our plan.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We can spend the night here and wait for Quetzalcoatl to head back to Uruk,</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> or see if there&#39;s an opening to get into the temple. What do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s not much time left.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...We can&#39;t sacrifice any more people in Uruk.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Including today, we have only five days left before Gorgon invades. It&#39;ll be four tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s true that it&#39;d be best to save as much time as we can, but...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree with Master. Invading enemy camps will always come with risks.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I imagine that Quetzalcoatl will interfere no matter how perfectly we prepare...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What you&#39;re saying is, if she&#39;s going to interfere anyway, then it&#39;s best for us to engage the enemy first. You got guts for saying that, Mash.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You heard that, Dr. Roman. How are things on your end? Have you figured out the layout of Eridu?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, leave it to me. Eridu is laid out much like Uruk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can see there&#39;s a large structure beyond the residential district. It&#39;s not as complicated as a ziggurat, but I imagine that&#39;s the temple.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If Mash carries Fujimaru and you all move through the residential district at full speed, you should reach the temple in less than 10 minutes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But I&#39;m detecting a large magical energy signal in front of the temple. That has to be Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If we launch an assault now, we&#39;ll have to do battle with her. There&#39;s no getting around it.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hmm? What&#39;s the problem with that?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Mash, young girl, pompous guy, Ishtar, and the great Jaguar Warrior.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> With this many of us, we can at least hold Kuku off for a bit.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> During that time, Fujimaru can run up to the top of the temple and destroy the Sun Stone, right?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Here. It&#39;s a spare of my unique weapon, the Death Claw. Also known as the “Fearsome Club. ”</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I thought this might happen, so last night I went on a jungle adventure while you slept, and made it.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> One good hit from this will reduce anything–even the Sun Stone–to dust! That should take Kuku&#39;s Divinity down a few notches!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> U-unique...(Gulp)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Unique! There&#39;s not another one like it. The second Fearsome Club!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What a capable, beautiful woman...!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I know, right? There&#39;s no one better at harassing Quetzalcoatl than me!</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;ve got our plan. So let&#39;s confirm one last time.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to go through this jungle and head into Eridu. With the Doctor&#39;s guidance, we can get to the temple without any problems.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No matter how we hide ourselves at the temple, Quetzalcoatl will likely detect us. So we&#39;ll just hit her head-on with all we&#39;ve got.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The Servants will give their all to keep Quetzalcoatl busy. That&#39;ll get you two or three minutes.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> With those few minutes, Fujimaru will enter the temple alone, and destroy the symbol at the altar.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Sound good? You know this whole plan is a long shot, and both Master and Servant could die, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;ll work.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...With this team, we can pull it off.</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Well, Romani Archaman, you heard [♂ him /♀ her]. Any objections?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a dangerous plan, but it&#39;s got its merits. No matter what we do, the chance of success is low anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Da Vinci has been watching and complaining this whole time, but she gave the go-ahead, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ll sanction the operation. Leave the backup to me, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s go...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! I will do everything to support you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s a large building in front of you. That&#39;s the temple! No...But that isn&#39;t like the temple in Uruk—</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> A goddess should have her own temple reconstructed according to her own tastes!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...So that staircase-looking thing must be Quetzalcoatl&#39;s temple!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s convenient. You won&#39;t get lost in there! The symbol has to be at the top!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I know climbing that extremely steep set of steps will be taxing, but you&#39;ll just have to put your backs into it and persevere!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> A path to get closer to the heavens, huh? The concept is the same as a ziggurat, but the approach is much more in tune with nature.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting several enemy signatures from all around Eridu! From the jungle, too! There are winged serpents gathering with the third and fourth waves!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If we fight them all, it&#39;ll take all night! Break through and head towards the temple!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve broken through the enemy and reached the temple, but something crazy is behind it!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s Marduk&#39;s axe! I&#39;m a little shocked myself! It&#39;s several times bigger than we were told!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hola! Welcome to my Sun Temple!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I love the way you headed straight here without wasting time, yes! Of course, that&#39;s been the case for more than just today, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You sped all the way here after my attack! It&#39;s so exciting, just like I hoped!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It was worth believing in Fujimaru and waiting, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Really, I&#39;m glad...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t waste any time outside of Eridu!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If you had done something pitiful like that, I would&#39;ve had to abandon my policy and just kill you all, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemy Servant is giving off overwhelming power!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But if we don&#39;t stop her, Master can&#39;t get to the altar!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ay no, how silly of me! I&#39;m being childish!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I saw a certain dummy who has no business being here, so I returned to my wild nature a little.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh crap. If the fight starts she&#39;ll kill me first. I just had a premonition and I&#39;m sure of it!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Sí! ☆ No mercy for you, amiga! Never! I&#39;m going to rip the flesh from your bones, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s fight! You&#39;ve come to defeat me by whatever means necessary, yes?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I respect your courage and decisiveness! I shall never back down from any fight, or any challenge!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I love! Humans are so fun to mess with!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You can kill them! You can let them live! You can threaten them, or protect them!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any memories left from the Cretaceous period, my first generation, but the seeds of information that are generations old tell me this!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I love you humans. I want to coexist with you.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Humans give meaning to our lives!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Meaning to your lives...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That makes no sense...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! Humans give you life and purpose, and yet you&#39;re trying to destroy them!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hehehe...It makes me feel funny when you scold me like that, yes! I like it!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...But it makes perfect sense, doesn&#39;t it? This is normal in human society, right?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Purpose isn&#39;t just some hobby. It&#39;s what you have to do to live, to be you! Yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m a deity who can&#39;t exist without messing with humans, and I don&#39;t just mean the body of the person who&#39;s my host.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> For humanity to survive longer, I need to help some of them, and get rid of others, so they can adapt to their environment.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Performing this cycle is what my life is about. It&#39;s why I exist.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Do you understand? I participated in this trial as one of the three goddesses because I want to play with humanity more.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> As long as I&#39;m here, humanity won&#39;t go extinct. But of course, they won&#39;t be safe or at peace either.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But smile! I will guarantee your freedom! The freedom to run from the threat of yours truly!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And I will SO enjoy watching you squirm! Like a naughty girl with ants and a magnifying glass!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru, this conversation is a waste of time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> There are many gods in this land, but she&#39;s on a whole other level! I&#39;ve never seen a deity whose love was this messed up!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ooh, I&#39;m blushing! You figured out why I&#39;m so in love with Fujimaru, yes?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait, when did that happen!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a traffic accident.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind a girl&#39;s personality as long as they are beautiful, but in this case, I just feel sorry for you...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> De nada. Mucho, mucho!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, this is serious-time! Stop trying to flirt from your Spanish dictionary!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Now, you&#39;re after the Sun Stone, right?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give your Master a chance, for as long as you can hold me off.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It can be a game. But first, I have a request.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Fujimaru, no matter what you fight or how it goes, don&#39;t forget to feel joy, yes?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I fight because it&#39;s fun! Humans fight because it&#39;s fun, too!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t have hatred in your heart, you won&#39;t kill your opponent! That&#39;s what makes lucha libre so great!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So you enjoy this danger too, okay? If you do, we can understand each other more, yes!</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> ...Heed me, child......Celebrate not with the joyous one...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can understand Quetzalcoatl.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll never understand Quetzalcoatl.</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That&#39;s what I want to hear, yes! I&#39;m so excited!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Fighting is what brings us joy! Survival is the fundamental principle of life! It&#39;s what allows man and the gods to communicate!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Now let&#39;s fight with all our strength!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ......Huh!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That made me so sad that I froze stiff...You can&#39;t enjoy fighting? That&#39;s a total denial of who I am, yes...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Fine! Then I&#39;ll ask you this instead!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> What is fighting to you, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s something to give your all, so you can relax later!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...I see. So that&#39;s the kind of person you are.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> A wonderful answer. It&#39;s so wonderful it makes me want to crush you.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Fine! Then give this fight with me your all! Oh my, oh my! This will be so much fun!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I never thought I&#39;d see the humanity we dreamed of in your generation!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Okay, you came all the way to the top! Hurry, Fujimaru! There on the altar...That&#39;s the Sun Stone...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Aztec Calendar...a monolith that&#39;s said to show the past, present, and future according to the Aztecs!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s definitely Quetzalcoatl&#39;s second Noble Phantasm! If we destroy it, this temple will just be a decoration,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> and we can remove Quetzalcoatl&#39;s trump card from the game! Two birds with one stone!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou! Roma, foou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash and the others are out of the fight! Quetzalcoatl is coming!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hurry, Fujimaru! This is our only chance to defeat the evil goddess!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Evil...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, Master Fujimaru!? Why are you stopping...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right, Doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That isn&#39;t what Quetzalcoatl wants to see...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Too bad! You&#39;re out of time, Fujimaru! I&#39;ll be up those steps before you can blink, yes!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooouuu!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hmph. So you figured out that what Kuku wants to see isn&#39;t a Servant victor, but a display of human resolve, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior!? How did you get up to the top of the altar!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She jumped. I can fly, so I just floated up here. In my boat.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway, Fujimaru, what are you going to do? You wasted your one and only chance, so what&#39;s your plan?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior and I can only block Quetzalcoatl&#39;s charge one time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You can smash the Sun Stone then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Jaguar Warrior is right.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...This is humanity&#39;s battle.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> This is one hell of a time for boasting.... But, yes, I agree, crazy as it is.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But how exactly are you going to fight? Hit her with that club?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious. I&#39;ll use height!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious. I&#39;ll use courage!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Height...Courage...Huh!? Also, Da Vinci just burst out laughing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to use a wrestling move on that goddess!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Heh. Nice idea, baby. That&#39;s my future high-income taxpayer!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I like your bravery. Your only hope, then, is a plancha. (Grinning)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A body slam from that height!? That&#39;s crazy! Stop it! It&#39;s suicide!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All Quetzalcoatl has to do is step to the side at the bottom of the steps and you&#39;re dead!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What the heck are you talking about, dummy!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter how much higher up you are. Higher is better for a plancha, meow!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> In other words, you need to go EVEN HIGHER!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Leave that to me! I&#39;ll take you as high as you can stomach!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> All right, that should do it. We&#39;re up another two hundred meters or so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> This is mostly down to your luck! I&#39;ll throw you at Quetzalcoatl as best as I can,</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> but if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll hit her, use your hands and feet to adjust your path! Like stabilizers!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Think about slamming your own belly button into her collar bone. That sounds like it&#39;ll work. Yep.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Alright, off you go! GOOOOOD LUUUCK!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll...get...you...for...this...Ishtaaaaaar!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> SKY HIGH RIDER-BUSTER JUSTICE BOMB!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You really threw yourself at me...!? At that height, even a lucha master like me can&#39;t save you!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And yet...And yet you&#39;re still going to try and hit me with that plancha!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> SAAAAAAAVE MEEEEE!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> JUUUUUUSTIIIIIICE!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Owwwww...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m alive...?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You&#39;re alive, yes! Just be grateful that I&#39;m a legendary lucha master, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You know the thing with flying moves?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Unless both the attacker and the target are the best at what they do, someone can end up dead, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You, Fujimaru, are an amateur, so your big sis was really worried...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But why were you so reckless? Didn&#39;t you think I&#39;d dodge?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I believed you&#39;d take it head-on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Because you love humans, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ～～～～!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Aww...Fujimaru, mi amor! I&#39;m so glad I joined the Three Goddess Alliance!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And now I&#39;m leaving it, yes! &#39;Cause I&#39;m making a contract with you!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Thank you! You beat me, Master! You&#39;re the first person to beat me so badly!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I am Quetzalcoatl, goddess of Mesoamerica! From now on, I&#39;ll use my power for you!</p><h2 id="section-13-prophecy-of-the-heavens" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-13-prophecy-of-the-heavens" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 13: Prophecy of the Heavens</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahem. All right, let&#39;s discuss our situation.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That is unnecessary, no! The goddess Quetzalcoatl has joined the party! That&#39;s all that matters, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Of course, they&#39;ll figure out the details later, so there&#39;s no need for an explanation, Romani.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Are you getting enough nutrition? Enough sleep? You look like you&#39;re about to collapse from the inside out. Are you all right?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be happy to give you a hug—Oh, that&#39;s impossible, no? Sorry for getting your hopes up.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Until this Singularity is restored, Rayshifting is impossible,</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> and even if it is restored, my Spirit Origin wasn&#39;t summoned by Chaldea, so I can&#39;t go to visit you, no?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s more or less correct, Quetzalcoatl. I&#39;m glad you understand.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Well, I guess we can&#39;t do anything about that, no?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s really a shame, but I believe in my fate with Fujimaru! ♪</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> AAAAND...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You, the girl who blocked my patada! You were so cool, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I love cool girls, yes! Tell me your name!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-wah-wah-wah...! Please don&#39;t grab my sides and lift me up...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please let me down, Quetzalcoatl! My name is Mash Kyrielight!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> What a wonderful name, yes! I&#39;m Quetzalcoatl! If it&#39;s too long, you can call me Coatl if you want, yes!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea. “Coatl” just means “snake”...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Huh? That girl over there...Is she...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Silence is golden, you feathered snake. Her situation is the gloomiest of all of us.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So it seems. I guess I&#39;ll act like the eldest, then. Hello, Ishtar. Is this the first time we&#39;ve met?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...? Of course it is. Well, we were shooting at each other a second ago.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> No! We&#39;re friends now! Friends! You&#39;re so cold, Ishtar! You should laugh more! Be bright, like the sun!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Nobody asked you. It&#39;s inelegant to shine brightly all the time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I shine brighter than anyone, but my blessings are only available to a chosen few...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s how the goddess of beauty should be. I don&#39;t just sparkle all the time like you.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hmm...So you&#39;re shy in spite of your divine aspects, yes! Is that just who you are, or is it the influence of your vessel?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Anyway, this is the only time in your life as a goddess that you&#39;re likely to be humble, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Congratulations on your good luck. You met a good Master, yes?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Stop patronizing me. You&#39;re the one who&#39;s been poisoned by human culture.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What the heck is this “lucha libre” stuff anyway? What you&#39;re doing is like using a space shuttle in a go-kart race.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You need to realize that, for those trying to race seriously, you&#39;re a bigger nuisance than the Incineration of Humanity!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> En serio!? Wow, the “space shuttle” sounds like a really strong flying moooooove, yes!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That wasn&#39;t a compliment! This goddess is all messed up. The wrestling virus has infected her brain.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;re like sisters.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They get along so well.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What? No! You take that back!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, maybe that&#39;s right. After all, they&#39;re both goddesses that rule Venus.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ishtar is the goddess of the morning star, Venus.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And Quetzalcoatl is often depicted as the god of destruction Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, who is the personification of the morning star in Aztec myth.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words, they&#39;re both related to Venus.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Maybe the reason Quetzalcoatl is a goddess this time is that her aspect as Venus, that is, beauty, has been emphasized.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...So it seems. The fact that she put the Sun Stone in her temple seems to mean she has no intention of using it herself.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That plumed snake intends on shining as a goddess with nothing but her own body.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Sí! The Sun Stone is dangerous and hot, yes! The only thing you&#39;re allowed to use outside the ring is folding chairs, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The one who stands out the most here is that mage!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hello, dweller of dreams. Was it you who made the cradle?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, wise Quetzalcoatl. Goddess of wisdom...Sower of the seeds of civilization...I can see where you got those titles.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> What&#39;s with all those titles, anyway? You must&#39;ve been busy back in the day.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> There was nobody else who could do it. After a few generations, those more suited than me took over.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Anyway, that finishes my introduction to everyone. Let&#39;s get to the main topic.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> About the Axe of Marduk, sitting there behind my temple...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Wah! How can you blatantly ignore me like that? I&#39;m purretty sure a goddess shouldn&#39;t behave that way!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Qué? I hear the voices of the fairies, yes. I guess there were a lot of them in these ancient eras☆</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I hear something, but do not see it. You humans call it the voice of the fairies.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So let&#39;s just ignore it. I can&#39;t see anything, and neither can you, yes? Yes?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Are you the devil!? I&#39;m here! Pay attention to me! Enough with those gestures and purrtending that nobody&#39;s here!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Adiós! Adiós! (Making gestures as if to say “Nobody&#39;s here! I can&#39;t see anyone! ”)</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> You&#39;re so mean! I&#39;ve worked so hard for you ever since we met in the jungle, and this is how you treat me!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What is your problem, Kuku!? When I slack off, you try to kill me!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> When I boycott work, you try to kill me! And when I&#39;m playing around you try to kill me!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Do you...not like me!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I hate you, yes! Jaguars must die, yes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Such harsh words! It&#39;s hard to believe they&#39;re coming from Quetzalcoatl!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, it actually isn&#39;t much of a surprise...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior is a Divine Spirit who was worshipped by Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Olmecs and the Aztecs.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The jaguar is a symbol of battle and death. Jaguar Warrior is said to be related to one aspect of Tezcatlipoca,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> one of the highest deities that frequently appears in Mesoamerican mythology...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And this Tezcatlipoca is a rival to Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl is the epitome of good, whereas Tezcatlipoca is the epitome of evil.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In the myths, Quetzalcoatl is even killed by Tezcatlipoca.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This resulted in the fall of the civilization that Quetzalcoatl had lovingly raised.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Death and rebirth always come together! Just because I&#39;m a jaguar doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m evil!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Qué? Te voy a matar, desgraciado! I&#39;ll kill you. Seriously.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Sorry, please stop. When Kuku seriously glares at me it makes me so scared I can&#39;t go to the bathroom at night.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So Jaguar Warrior was real...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Of course I&#39;m real! What did you people think I was!?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Perhaps some kind of jungle hallucination was my thought. I hear Mexico has some good cacti.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> You thought I was the spirit of a peyote!?</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...So as you see, I&#39;m a poor jaguar spirit who was cruelly abused by Kuku...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Even when I got the sacrifices, I couldn&#39;t eat their hearts...and she got serious mad too.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Of course. I won&#39;t allow sacrifices to take place in my sight. I only accept them when I take a new host.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need any other sacrificial rituals.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Unlike Tezcatlipoca, I don&#39;t look forward to the sacrificial rituals.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> You see? That&#39;s why all the warriors that were sacrifices are still alive!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> They&#39;re all doing the training that Kuku set for them, all over Eridu.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> She said, “First you&#39;re going to learn to take a hit! ” and forced them into horrifyingly difficult training...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> (Shivering) Those poor soldiers...That&#39;s a fate worse than death, I think...Kuku&#39;s such a sadist...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You want to join them? Learn lucha? I&#39;ll start by breaking your limbs and hurling you into the sea!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> She says it with a smile, too! Fujimaru, don&#39;t be tricked by–GWAH!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Back to the topic at hand! ♡</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Wasn&#39;t your goal to get the Axe of Marduk more than it was to get rid of me?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. We need the destructive power of that axe to defeat Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we came here. But what do we do?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Nobody told me that axe was so big. We&#39;re not strong enough to carry it.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I thought so. It weighs the same as all of Eridu. But I know another way to carry it.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We can make a rope with jungle vines, and have my winged serpents carry it to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have three teams of three hundred of them take turns carrying it.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;ll take three days. Is that enough time?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course! That would be great! You work on a whole different scale, Quetzalcoatl!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re way more useful than Merlin!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m a thinker, not a worker. Don&#39;t compare me to a war god.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But it&#39;s true that Quetzalcoatl is useful. Let&#39;s keep on relying on her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Though it bothers me to make a lady do all the work.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to worry about that, no!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Because there&#39;s something I want you to do before I get the winged serpents ready!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Okay! Look at all those groundskeepers standing around the axe, yes!</p><p><strong>H：Giant Statues:</strong><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> An army of...giant wrestlers!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bunch of Spriggans!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Sí! A defense system left behind by the Mesopotamian gods!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> They&#39;ve got an attack bonus against divinities, too, so that none of the gods can misuse it!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be a bit hard for me and Ishtar to deal with them. So you can take care of it!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh my. I guess it was too early to assume going home was going to be a cakewalk. Very well. Let&#39;s do it, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s nothing compared to what Quetzalcoatl has to do. Just be careful when you select your party members.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Make sure you think carefully before you start the fight, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Well done! Now just leave the next three days and three nights to my babies, yes!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I contacted King Gilgamesh as well. I told him we could deliver the goods a day before Gorgon&#39;s attack.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then let&#39;s return to Uruk. It&#39;s a two-day trip from Eridu, so we do have some leeway, but...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ah, in that case, can we spare just a little time?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Since we&#39;re in Eridu...You just have to see the finest cylinder seals Eridu has to offer.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Cylinder seals...?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> This is the center of Eridu, where royal authority was granted. It is a bit odd that I&#39;d introduce you to this place, being a foreign deity...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Royal authority is “proof of kingship” as granted by the gods...Just think of it as being akin to a contract or covenant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In Mesopotamia, the gods decide who will be king. One is chosen from among the rulers of the land.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As for the cylinder seals...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> They&#39;re those big pillars. The seals are, as the name suggests, like one&#39;s personal seal.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fujimaru, perhaps you used stamp-like personal seals back home?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You know, a drawing carved on a block, which you then press onto ink, so you can make many copies of it onto paper.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, in Uruk–5,000 years before your time–that type of seal was already a part of daily life.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course, they weren&#39;t used as signatures. They were for magical ceremonies.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> They had tales carved into them, were dipped in mud, and were then rolled onto things. Tools for the mass production of stories, if you will.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It seems the cylinder seals here are the biggest and the oldest ones of all.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see. You won&#39;t be able to read it like this, so let me transcribe it onto the air.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What is this...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A city and a dragon...?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hm...Quite a story we have here.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> “When a ring of light appears in the heavens, the land of Mesopotamia shall be returned to its origin. ” Hm...It&#39;s a seal that predicted our current situation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The city it refers to is Uruk. And the giant dragon is the goddess Tiamat...Referring to Gorgon?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I exercise my right, in other words, my god-given right to remain silent.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I reserve the right to withhold comment as well, yes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Um, to be frank, Ti–whoof!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hush, furryball. This is only a sightseeing spot. It holds no special meaning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Really? But the fact that it&#39;s a sightseeing spot...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. Eridu is a city of the same size as Uruk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To the people of Mesopotamia, the contents of this seal may be well known.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The people of Uruk were afraid of Tiamat because they already knew of the prophecy on this seal.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...I suppose so. And that Goldie established the Demonic Front, knowing the content on this seal.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m not one to talk since I was a part of the Three Goddess Alliance, but the people of Uruk don&#39;t know when to quit!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But as a result, this land managed to stave off ruin for half a year, and a Master named Fujimaru made it in time.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And now it is my turn to reward those efforts.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m a flighty goddess, but I will do everything in my power to help you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well. It&#39;ll be a pain if you change sides again so easily, but you are welcome as an ally.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And I get why you wanted to show this to Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It seems you really are a goddess who watches over human growth. Without being overprotective, you&#39;re more of a reliable older sister than mother.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Heehee, you&#39;re embarrassing me! Actually, they did call me “Big Sis” yes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Meowhahaha, I&#39;m the older sister type, too! Count me in!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> ...Wait a second! I just realized! Isn&#39;t this totally like a harem girls situation!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Three goddesses, a little girl, and a kouhai! That&#39;s a really high percentage of girls.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a passionate youth event starts up one of these days.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ah, Jaguar, you&#39;re leaving the group. I&#39;m appointing you supervisor of the axe-bearing winged serpents.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Huh!? Oh, come on! You just demoted me to the B-team! I wanna be next to Fujimaru, where the main action is!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Heh-heh. Are you going to make me repeat myself? (Translation: Should I make you a carpet, or mount your head on the wall? )</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Okay, the winged serpents will be in good paws! I&#39;ll make sure they get to Uruk in three days!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...And so, Jaguar Warrior has left our party. Quetzalcoatl has good judgment.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I know, right? When you&#39;re on the road, the fewer rivals the better!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Oh yes. Ishtar, you can fly too, so there&#39;s no need for you to come with us to the jungle, is there?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You should probably leave this to Ana and me, and return to Uruk ahead of us.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m coming with you. As if I could leave a goddess alone when she obviously has an ulterior motive...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Right, Mash? You&#39;re on my side, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh...I&#39;m not on anyone&#39;s side, but I just hope the road back is a safe one.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mmm...Contrary to what Jaguar Warrior said before, this is no harem...It&#39;s more like a gambling den...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s been a colorful trip this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, last time it was all dudes.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Haha, maybe this is just the universe balancing itself out. Truly, after seven searches, this kind of thing was bound to happen.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is what makes journeys so much fun. In any event, it&#39;s a good thing that the final search is a colorful one.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m certain Demonic Beasts will attack a few times before you reach Ur, but they&#39;d be no match for you now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enjoy yourself on the way back. Just don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Ah, is it THAT time already?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...It must be Ishtar o&#39;clock.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...You&#39;ve got some good instincts. However, I do question your character for talking to someone without looking at them.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Or does it mean you&#39;ve become sensitive to my presence?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Heh. If that&#39;s it, I wouldn&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That just means it&#39;s been worth teaching you proper manners when dealing with goddesses every night.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Was that what we&#39;ve been talking about?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing! You were so disrespectful when we met that I was teaching you lots of things so that other goddesses wouldn&#39;t kill you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (In night mode from the get-go today, huh...)</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Wh-what is it? That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m telling you not to do.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You don&#39;t stare at someone&#39;s face in silence, whether she&#39;s a goddess or not. You need to say witty things or whisper sweet nothings.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Never mind. Tonight I came to praise you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It looks like you&#39;ve befriended another new goddess. Well done. I applaud you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It really is impressive. But for some reason, I&#39;m miffed. Let me pinch your cheek a bit.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ah...That made me feel better...What a strange effect. I&#39;m going to record it thus:</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> “When Fujimaru becomes friendly with another goddess, inflicting physical pain will dispel my depression...”</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway! You know, despite her appearance, Quetzalcoatl is the strongest within the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If she went all out, she could even defeat Gorgon, who has been gaining strength as she slaughters humans.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But even after leaving the alliance, the law of the alliance still binds us.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Because fellow goddesses can&#39;t attack each other, the question of who is stronger is meaningless.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So in the end, we have to defeat them ourselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes. That&#39;s why you can never let your guard down.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl&#39;s not that useful, so–Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Say, you&#39;re looking mighty pale! Have you come down with something!? Let me feel your forehead!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yikes, you&#39;re burning up! I&#39;ve never felt a forehead so hot before!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The jungle? Is it because of the jungle!? Is there some unknown infectious disease going around? Earth really is unclean! Dirty, filthy!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a cold, if that&#39;s what you mean.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m just tired.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> R-really? Just how tired are you? Hmm-hmm...You haven&#39;t had any decent rest in a whole month...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re taking the term hard work to the extreme! Even hard labor in Kur only lasts for three days!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nah, it&#39;s like this every time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Maybe it&#39;s a little tougher than usual this time.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I-I didn&#39;t know...You are investigating the Singularities, after all. I suppose that is a difficult battle for you humans.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...All right, then I&#39;ll take the rest of your watch. You go lie down over there.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ll guard the entire area. I swear by the name of Irkalla, no enemies shall come near.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So, sleep and be at ease. Of course, you can also tell me stories about the Singularities you&#39;ve encountered so far.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The night is long. I promise I won&#39;t get bored. I&#39;ll be a good listener.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, if you&#39;re interested...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Long ago in Okeanos, a rotten pirate named Blackbeard...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> A pyramid from the sky! What a foolish Heroic Spirit! I know the type. Just as stupid as King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That Nitocris sounds likable. A Heroic Spirit who treats ghosts well is a Heroic Spirit who appreciates the good things in life!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ah...But skull-faced Heroic Spirits kind of turn me off. Wearing bones on their flesh just sounds painful...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you liked my stories.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I ended up telling you about all six of them...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I ended up tiring you even more! But I enjoyed it! Thank you for sharing your experiences with me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You enjoyed it...?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m sure it was a tough, merciless experience for you...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But all that...it&#39;s like the sort of thrilling adventure I always dreamt of. And more than anything...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...each one of those Singularities ended happily! You&#39;re not the only one who worked hard.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The humans in each period you visited never gave up. No matter how rough it got, they gritted their teeth and rose up.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes, just what I expect of humans! Nature, fate, the gods, and even evil itself within humanity...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Only humans can bring down all of that nonsense! They are the epitome of unlimited potential, so it is appropriate that I protect them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You like humans?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You like adventure?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> W-well, yes. I like them.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I want to protect humans as well as have an adventure like that.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But I...don&#39;t have that kind of freedom...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...It looks like the morning sun is about to rise. We&#39;d better get some sleep. We&#39;re going back to Uruk soon, right?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The area around Uruk is overrun with Gorgon&#39;s Demonic Beasts, but I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t be any problem for you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Although I can&#39;t vouch for what&#39;s going on within Uruk&#39;s walls...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, that ends our nightly chat. You&#39;re a frail human, so get your rest now.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Vaya! The wall that blew to smithereens is properly restored, yes! Uruk&#39;s people are amazing, yes!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Of course. They are all hard workers. The only one with permanent behavioral issues is Goldie.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, even he will bow his head to this!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> “I never imagined Quetzalcoatl would join our forces! You really are the goddess of victory, Ishtar! ” Yep, that&#39;s what he&#39;ll say.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, Ishtar. That seems likely.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh only planned on defeating Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think even he could&#39;ve predicted Fujimaru&#39;s actions.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s wrong, Ana?</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...The gatekeeper isn&#39;t there. I don&#39;t smell blood, but I have a bad feeling about this...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru. Something&#39;s bothering me...So I&#39;m going to go ahead on my own.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...After I check and see that everything&#39;s all right, I&#39;ll head straight to the Chaldean Embassy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Indeed, it feels like life has been drained from the entire city. I don&#39;t hear any construction work going on like before.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry into the city, Master. We should assume something has happened.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Nobody is walking around in the streets. The stores are closed too...What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Lord Merlin, you have returned! Oh, but...But you have returned too late.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, you. Just the face I wanted to see. What on earth happened here? And what do you mean by “too late”?</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> ...Lord Merlin...And you, Lord Fujimaru of Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Please calm down and listen...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> ...King Gilgamesh has passed away. They are currently holding his funeral at the ziggurat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-what!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> There&#39;s really a funeral!? Siduri, what is the meaning of this!?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Oh...everyone...You have...returned...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> But...You&#39;re too late...King Gilgamesh is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What in the world happened!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> How could anyone kill HIM!?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, there&#39;s no way King Gilgamesh could die!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He&#39;s a man who saw the future and voluntarily became a mage! He must have had proper precautions against assassinations!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He promised me that he&#39;d concentrate on giving orders from the throne to prevent dying on the battlefield!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Who could kill him? And how?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Merlin is really pissed...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m curious too.</p><hr><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...How the king died, you ask...Well...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe this...Oh...How terrifying...I never imagined it would be this sharp...!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh!? You&#39;re trembling. Are you not feeling well!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it, fool! The blueprint for the Fangs of Napishtim is finally complete!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Look here, and feast your eyes on its magnificence! This is prized work. Take this to the armory.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We have no time. Build it directly on-site...not in Uruk. Tell them to complete it within two days.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> (Whew...) So it was your usual kingly extreme emotional outburst. I see...This is...!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> External pressure automatically builds the frame, which, according to your plans, transforms this much within 10 seconds...!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Truly the work of a genius...! My king, perhaps you should consider becoming an architect!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tempt me; I&#39;d seriously consider it. A king should be versed in architecture if he hopes to be a truly well-rounded ruler.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> By the way, it&#39;s an interlocking wooden frame, and the pressure comes from oil. It all rises up as if a wave is pushing it into the air.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As it is similar to chugging down a stein of ale, I call it the Chug-a-Lug Style. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Genius, my king! You should get a patent for it as well.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> This is our secret weapon to defeat Gorgon in the battle to come. Let us send materials to Nippur in advance.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Idiot, it&#39;s the reverse. This goes from here to here, and place them in this manner.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Eh...Why would you place it there? What about defeating Gorgon?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Confronting that goddess is Fujimaru&#39;s job. It is not a place for me to interfere...Ugh...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> My king...? Perhaps you really are not feeling well...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Perhaps. It&#39;s only a slight dizziness, but I may have overworked these past few days.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If my magical energy fails, the barrier will be weaker. One can&#39;t rule out an attack by the Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Merlin should be back tomorrow. Now, until then—</p><p><strong>F：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Pardon me, Your Majesty! A messenger from the Northern Wall is here to see you!</p><p><strong>A：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Pardon me, Your Majesty! We have received a petition from the eastern market!</p><p><strong>B：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Pardon me, Your Majesty! We have a complaint from the brothel!</p><p><strong>C：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Pardon me, Your Majesty! A request from the priestess academy has been delivered!</p><p><strong>D：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Pardon me, Your Majesty! Regarding today&#39;s ceremonies, the Sacred Temple has–</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Come now, line up single file, and I&#39;ll deal with you one by one! Siduri, go run over to the armory!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Things have settled down for now. Looks like I can finally take a small break.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But why is it so hectic!? They&#39;ll work me to death before we face the goddesses!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Whew...A throne is here to show authority, not to rest. But now, I have no choice...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I assume Siduri will return in five minutes...Until then, just for a moment...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmm...I must have fallen asleep...Every second is so precious...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Siduri, how long have I been asleep? One minute? Five minutes?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Hmm. I seem to have awoken from my nap in the depths of Kur...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...This is no time for jokes! I really am dead here!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...And that&#39;s how it went. I returned to see the king on his throne, in eternal slumber...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He died...from overwork...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why there are no wounds...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, no, that just cannot be! This is very relevant to my interests! I could die just like this!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is THE King Gilgamesh! If it were so easy to kill him, he would&#39;ve died dozens of times by now!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Y-you&#39;re right. I...I lost my cool in the heat of the moment.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Thinking back, it felt strange in Uruk when we left as well.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Lady Siduri, after we headed to Ur, did something strange happen here in the city?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s see. The assault of the Demonic Beasts calmed down, but we had many reports of deaths from weakness within Uruk.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think much of it because of the king&#39;s funeral, but it is indeed abnormal. Can this be—</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Unnatural, you mean to say? Yes, King Gilgamesh didn&#39;t work himself to death. Someone killed him.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Which means the Three Goddess Alliance must be responsible. I don&#39;t think anyone else is capable of killing the king.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That is true, but...Can Gorgon really kill so indirectly?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl is all about physical combat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ishtar is all about archery and loud laughs.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Within the Three Goddess Alliance, there is no goddess that can perform such an assassination...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh? What are you guys talking about?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hold on, Mash, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ishtar isn&#39;t in the Three Goddess Alliance. She kept getting in our way, didn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ooooh! Now that you mention it, you&#39;re right!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She was killing Gorgon&#39;s Demonic Beasts, which would be against the Three Goddess Alliance rules!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but, if so, who is the third goddess!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Who, you ask? It&#39;s Ereshkigal. You didn&#39;t know that until now?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> She&#39;s god indigenous to this land, yes. Queen of Kur, ruler of death and phantoms.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wh-what did you say!? Ereshkigal is here!? Why!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So not even Ishtar knew the True Name of the third goddess...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, how...? The only Sumerian deity left in this era should be Ishtar...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> “All is well in the underworld...” Oh, I see. I get it, so that&#39;s the trick.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ereshkigal&#39;s resurrection, and Ishtar not noticing it...How very, very odd, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t be a smart-ass, Merlin! If you know something, let&#39;s hear it!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> All right. In the Sumerian myths,</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ishtar, the “Queen of Heaven,” and Ereshkigal, the “Queen of Kur,” are like cats and dogs.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ishtar headed to the underworld for no reason, and was stripped of her divinity by the seven underworld gates.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And there she was even murdered by Ereshkigal. Isn&#39;t that right, Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. Got a problem? Those seven cursed gates, ugh!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> They stripped away the Authority that I&#39;d prepared to use against Ereshkigal, and in the end I was dragged in front of her all naked,</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> and mercilessly skewered over and over with spears. Since then, I really have a hard time dealing with her.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But why did Ereshkigal get resurrected? And on top of that, she&#39;s part of the Three Goddess Alliance!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> As far as her joining the alliance, I imagine only she knows that reason. But I know why Ereshkigal was resurrected.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s you, Ishtar. When you were summoned, Ereshkigal was summoned, too.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I thought it strange to begin with. Why did the temple matron, who successfully summoned you, die?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The most likely answer is that Ereshkigal killed her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She summoned not one, but two goddesses. The girl that served as your vessel had quite an amusing persona.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She was able to cleanly separate her good and evil sides. One became you, and the other became Ereshkigal.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> In other words...good Ishtar and evil Ereshkigal!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well OF COURSE! I am indeed a goddess of good!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Hahaha. Indeed. Hahaha...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Impossible...An evil Ishtar and a good Ereshkigal!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I get it, I get it, I&#39;ve been touting my own goodness too much. Besides, I can get more offerings if I&#39;m a tad bad, yeah?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> By the way, come by my Eanna later, Fujimaru, okay?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give you a worse scare than you&#39;d ever get in Kur♡</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see...Ishtar, the goddess of bountiful harvest, can be seen as the Great Earth Mother symbolizing human life.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> On the other hand, Ereshkigal symbolizes human death, and is the Terrible Earth Mother.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The two goddesses are two sides of the same coin, and perhaps born from the same deity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The goddess nurturing life later becomes a goddess of death. Izanami of Japanese myths follows this pattern as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So...if Ishtar was summoned, then by extension Ereshkigal would be too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Furthermore, they&#39;re the same deity, so that&#39;s why we only counted a single Sumerian goddess.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wow...Then what, she might have been secretly using this body of mine the whole time!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The possibility does exist. Ereshkigal cannot leave Kur.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> When she moved around above ground, she probably used your body. Secretly, like when you were asleep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It is Ereshkigal&#39;s scent of death that fills Uruk now.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ereshkigal&#39;s gallû spirits remove souls from the weak and exhausted first.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> One such spirit must have taken King Gilgamesh&#39;s soul to Kur.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, we still have time! We haven&#39;t yet buried the king&#39;s corpse.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> If we liberate his soul from the soul cages, he might wake up!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That is correct, Lady Siduri. Actually, we&#39;d be in a lot of trouble if we lost him now.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh&#39;s leadership is an absolute necessity if we want to defeat Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Which means we&#39;ll have to head to Kur and retrieve his soul...! Right, Senpai!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh. Wait, you both speak of going to Kur so easily. Isn&#39;t that a bit...overzealous?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s the underworld. A world where every Heroic Spirit and deity is powerless!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> There, Ereshkigal is the absolute law. No matter what you do, you&#39;ll get captured and sentenced to skewering, you see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh must be saved!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Time for rescuing, not talking!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, we don&#39;t get a chance like this often! Let&#39;s make sure to put King Gilgamesh deep in our debt for this!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Crap, I don&#39;t like where this is going. I need to escape while I can—)</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hold it right there Ishtar, yes! You know how to get to the underworld, right?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So hurry up and guide us there, yes! It&#39;s fine, Fujimaru will make the third goddess fall as well, yes!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wait, you fiery meathead! Let go! Let. Go. Of. Me!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Dumuzid, the God of Shepherds, isn&#39;t there anymore! We can&#39;t be resurrected if we die, so why do you want to go to the underwooorld!?</p><h2 id="section-14-goodbye-goddess-of-the-underworld" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14-goodbye-goddess-of-the-underworld" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 14: Goodbye, Goddess of the Underworld</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Back in Kutha. You certainly got there fast.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Although, I suppose Ishtar slowed us down since we had to drag her the whole way...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ugh...If only Quetzalcoatl wasn&#39;t around...I could&#39;ve escaped...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Give it up, Ishtar. You promised Fujimaru too, right?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If you say you&#39;re on their side, you stay on their side until they betray you or fall.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that dedication the universal pride of all goddesses?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Okay, okay, I give up. I&#39;ll tag along on your trip to the underworld.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But only Fujimaru, Mash, and I are going in.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl and Merlin, you stay here. Especially you, Quetzalcoatl. You would be a sitting duck down there.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...? Yuk ak katán!? (What are you saying!? )</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Divinity works negatively in Kur. The weak stay as they are, but the strong are weakened.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Death and its queen, Ereshkigal, rule supreme there. What do you think happens when a god dies in Kur?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I see. They&#39;d go wild, say things like “I do not accept death,” and then just head right back to the world above. There&#39;d be no life or death anymore.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Even gods must remain in the underworld once they die.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why there&#39;s a system that nullifies their powers. Fascinating.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even knowing what it&#39;s like in the underworld, Ishtar, you challenged it anyway. You&#39;re amazing.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Mash...You&#39;re not saying that sarcastically...You&#39;re just a goofball. I can&#39;t possibly get mad at you...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I went down to the underworld because I was arrogant.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> In the myths surrounding me, I was spoiled, praised, and knew no fear.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So I laughed off the perils of the underworld, and challenged it using seven Authorities.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I felt nothing was impossible for me after conquering Mt. Ebih. But the result was a miserable defeat. A complete, total loss.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I would have loved to have seen that, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Worst-case scenario, please make sure at least Fujimaru and Mash return, yes!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...You do realize that&#39;s not what “worst-case scenario” means, right?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We&#39;ll either all return after defeating Ereshkigal, or we fail and everyone is trapped. It&#39;s only one or the other.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m having you two remain here. If it comes to that, then it&#39;s your turn.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Figure out a way to strike a deal with Ereshkigal to get her to return Mash and Fujimaru to the living world.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> All right. For the good of our mission, I shall remain behind! That said, though, you&#39;re a strange one, Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You&#39;re walking into a battle you don&#39;t think you can win. Do goddesses mature when they become independent from their fathers?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Say whatever you want. Anyway, where&#39;s Ana? You didn&#39;t bring her?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No...She hadn&#39;t returned to the Chaldean Embassy. We didn&#39;t have time to wait or look for her, so we left her behind.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I see. Well, she&#39;d be useless in the underworld anyway. So I suppose that works out regardless.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Then, let&#39;s begin. Are you really okay with this, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go to the underworld!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No time to hesitate, huh. Fine, I&#39;ll share your enthusiasm!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> By the way, how do we get to the underworld?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> How, you ask? Hehehe...Like this, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Mash, take care of Fujimaru! Merlin, Quetzalcoatl, stand back!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Load the tide-convergence rounds in Maanna&#39;s bow cannons! Output at isosceles of 1/3 the lapis lazuli!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Gate of Kur, shatter! Let the light of An shine through the skyless Ki! In other words...I&#39;ll blow a giant hole in the ground!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> All right, success! This is the underworld, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Owwww...Are you all right, Master? I managed to guard you with my shield...I think...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ishtar, why do you have to be so...Ishtar?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Can you do spells that aren&#39;t twinkly, Ishtar?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I-I can teleport, too. But if I teleport into the underworld, it&#39;ll be scary afterwards.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If my powers are sealed the instant we arrive, we&#39;ll all just fall and die.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s better if we don&#39;t have to teleport. You can get to the underworld by digging through the ground, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...? What did you just say!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good, I got through! You said you were going to the underworld, so I was worried I might not be able to observe you. Guess I was wrong!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I mean, you&#39;re really just underground! The real-deal Age of Gods is amazing! The underworld is physically linked to the real world!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-so it&#39;s true!? It wasn&#39;t, like, some area in another dimension!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Of course. In the Age of Gods, the heavens, the earth, and the underworld are all situated on the same layer of scroll.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The afterlife and the world of the skies become metaphysical only after the end of the Age of Gods.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then, this really is the underworld...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, truly a surprise...This underground cavern is unthinkable by our understanding of geology...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh? Senpai, what are those? Those long, narrow things scattered around...They look like birdcages...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...o...uh...o...ooh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...There are lights floating around inside them...Too many to count...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s best you don&#39;t get near them. Those lights are the souls of the dead–of humans who have died on the surface.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Could those...cages be...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yup. Ereshkigal&#39;s soul cages. Souls trapped in there can never return to the world of the living.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> When the physical body dies, the soul starts to fade, then disappears. But Ereshkigal doesn&#39;t let that happen.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She cages up the souls of humans she likes, and keeps them at her side to enjoy for tens of thousands of years.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Bare souls like that–humans without a body–feel cold. Very cold.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So they start to freeze, beginning with their limbs, until they eventually become living ice.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> One would rather fade away than feel that pain–but these trapped souls can&#39;t even do that. They have no freedom.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Until Ereshkigal bores of them, they have to stay there like that, writhing in torment.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Then, the souls that withered to death on Earth are here, too?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Most likely. There are more soul cages here than before. Probably thanks to the work of the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...I wonder if she&#39;s trying to make a kingdom of the dead? She was never cruel like this in the past...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where is Ereshkigal?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Over there. On the other side of the narrow cliff path. Ereshkigal&#39;s palace is beyond the seven gates.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She can&#39;t step one foot outside of that place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, she&#39;s trapped inside too? Ereshkigal, a goddess?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Who knows? They say it&#39;s what the gods decided. But it&#39;s none of my business.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway, this is where Fujimaru and Mash come in.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We&#39;ll start by going through the first gate over there. Doing so will help you understand the rules of the underworld.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So she says, Senpai...Well, to start we should get closer to it...</p><p><strong>First Gate:</strong><br> Answer me...Answer me...</p><p><strong>First Gate:</strong><br> You who live...You who have fallen into the underworld...Tell me how your soul should be...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru, you&#39;ll get a binary sort of question. The underworld gates are fair and logical, and their job is to test whether a soul is good or evil.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Good and evil are equal in value. Only the values of that human, the chooser, change...So there&#39;s no right answer.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No matter which you choose, we will have to deal with an annoying trial. Just pick whichever answer seems easier.</p><p><strong>First Gate:</strong><br> Now, sinful Fujimaru, answer me...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Huh? [♂ He /♀ She] got called by name...? )</p><p><strong>First Gate:</strong><br> Standards of beauty seem diverse but are absolute. Black wins over white, the earth wins over the heavens. Then...</p><p><strong>First Gate:</strong><br> Ereshkigal or Ishtar. Which is more beautiful?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hold on a sec! That&#39;s different from before!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All right, a question with not a scrap of logic! Which is it, Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Heh, of course! You&#39;ll be absolutely fine. I thought as much, but thanks, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s not a hard choice when one is a goddess of rot and decay, and the other beauty and bounty!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If it&#39;s a beauty contest one thousand out of one hundred people will choose me, of course!</p><p><strong>First Gate:</strong><br> NIIITWIIIT...You...shall...die...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ereshkigal.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Argh! Betrayed at the very first gate!? Oh, I get it. That&#39;s not it. This is a battle of wits!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I-isn&#39;t that right? As long as you compliment Ereshkigal, the enemy will weaken. That&#39;s what this means, right!?</p><p><strong>First Gate:</strong><br> AWWWKWAAARRRD...But...ve...ry...well!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy forces have been defeated! Looks like we can move on, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ugh, what a terrifying question that was...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wow, what a deep and insightful question that was...</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It sounded like pure evil to me! ...I hope it&#39;s not going to be like this the whole time...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, maybe it was just a one-off thing?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ishtar and Ereshkigal are the goddesses of the heavens and the earth. That makes them good benchmarks for comparison.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I hope so. Now then, we just need to pass through the gate itself...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s any kind of trap either. See? I went through it and nothing&#39;s happening, Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Seems so. That&#39;s a relief. Thanks, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s get moving!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Augh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar!? What happened? Is something wrong!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Owww...Something shocked me...But I&#39;m fine, I just got the chills when I passed through the gate.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see anything...anything...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hey, do you feel something weird?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you lose weight...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Did you just shrink...?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Right!? I&#39;ve obviously shrunk, haven&#39;t I!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Indeed you have. Do you finally see what a fool you are, Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Your last descent into the underworld ended in failure. So long as that myth exists, you cannot escape the curse of the underworld.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> The crown symbolizing the wilderness, the reed measuring rod, the lapis lazuli choker, the bead necklace, the gold armlet, the gorgeous brooch...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> And last, the garment of ladyship. I once robbed you of these seven treasures.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> The rule remains unchanged even now. If you don&#39;t have an Authority that corresponds to them, you yourself will have to pay the price.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you see? You will become smaller every time you pass through a gate. You will be robbed of your divinity one-seventh at a time.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> By the second gate, you will be a low-rank Divine Spirit. By the fourth gate, you will be even weaker than a gallû.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> And by the end, you&#39;ll be a powerless bug. A sad little butterfly that&#39;ll be crushed within my hands.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> How nasty! You&#39;ve gotten even worse than before, Ereshkigal!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...That is not true. I&#39;ve given you some mercy at least.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Normally, you and that human would&#39;ve been dropped into the pits of the underworld the moment you brought the living here.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> However, if you take on the trials of the seven gates, your fate will be decided by the laws of the underworld.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Fujimaru. If you&#39;ve come to defeat me, overcome those trials.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> If you safely pass through those seven gates, then I, the ruler of the underworld, shall welcome you here as visitors...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-we&#39;re in trouble now! Ishtar cannot go on like this!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...No. I&#39;m moving forward. I expected something like this.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I told you I wouldn&#39;t be much use fighting in the underworld, remember? This doesn&#39;t really change anything.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You, me, and Gilgamesh too. The moment we reached the underworld, there was nowhere to run.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Before we get used to the cold of the underworld, we need to defeat Ereshkigal and escape. Otherwise Uruk will perish.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Which means we have no choice. So prepare yourself, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. Ereshkigal is also one of the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to have to fight her anyway. Defeating her here would be for the best, really.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Move forward, Fujimaru. It looks like we don&#39;t have much time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The underworld is part of the present world, but just being here drains your vitality and the strength of your destiny.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The strength of your destiny is, let&#39;s see...Think of it as the intrinsic luck necessary to facilitate the continuation of life.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No matter the life form, we are constantly using this type of luck to avoid mortal danger.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If this significantly drops in a person, they will get into a nasty accident. Like getting hit by a car while on a walk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The underworld&#39;s filled with death, so there&#39;s no need for it. It&#39;s a world that doesn&#39;t need any luck.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. That&#39;s why if you stay here too long, you won&#39;t live long even if you get back to the surface.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Now do you understand how this place works? Then let&#39;s hurry up and get to the second gate already.</p><p><strong>Second Gate:</strong><br> Answer me...Answer me...</p><p><strong>Second Gate:</strong><br> Although money and riches continue to flow, only one is worthy to own all. Only one can manage the wealth of the world.</p><p><strong>Second Gate:</strong><br> In other words...which goddess is worthy of this wealth, Ereshkigal or Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Alright, we&#39;re lucky it&#39;s another easy question! You don&#39;t even have to think, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No need to think, it&#39;s Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Of course! That&#39;s my specialty! Leave Chaldea&#39;s fund management to me!</p><p><strong>Second Gate:</strong><br> OUT...WHY...HAVEN&#39;T...YOU...LEARNED?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> After due consideration, Ereshkigal!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> R-right, let&#39;s give the job to Ereshkigal on purpose and let her go bankrupt, right!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We&#39;re gonna make her show how terrible she is at it to demonstrate the difference between us...That&#39;s the plan, right!?</p><p><strong>Second Gate:</strong><br> SAFE...YOU...MAY...PASS...</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...I got cursed again...I guess it&#39;s useless even if I block it with magical energy at max power...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> At this rate, not only will I be unable to fight, but Ereshkigal will crush me like a bug...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure? It doesn&#39;t look like your bow&#39;s destructive power has declined at all...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You may be shrinking, but you are still helping in our battles.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Sorry, I&#39;ve about reached my limit though. Soon I&#39;m going to run out of energy, so I&#39;ll leave the fighting to you two.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...This isn&#39;t good. We&#39;re only at the second gate. How far can we go without Ishtar...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash and I will take care of it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, of course. I shall do my best, so I don&#39;t let you down, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. Ishtar&#39;s got this.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Weren&#39;t you listening to what I just said!? I told you that it&#39;s tiring me out, so I can&#39;t!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The third gate&#39;s ahead. The enemies of the trials are definitely growing stronger. I hope we can get through this one as well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Choosing answers that favor Ereshkigal is clearly making the battles easier, but...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No! I don&#39;t care! No matter how tough it is, there are some things that a woman just can&#39;t give up, Mash.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Looking at these other goddesses, I know I&#39;m better! Better than all of them! But I just can&#39;t lose to this one woman.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s a battle with a hopelessly irritating rival!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s an enemy that&#39;s a mirror image of yourself...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Literally the worst, eh?</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t know you had that much spirit in you. You&#39;ve certainly got a big mouth, you little brat.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...? Wait, are you literally turning into a LITTLE brat, little brat? Fwahahaha, now that&#39;s amusing!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You must be worried descending through the underworld like this! Fujimaru, little brat...You&#39;re finally at a loss!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s someone behind those rocks! Master, allow me to attack!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay, beat the crap out of them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Wait, that laugh could only be...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahahahahaha! Good work coming to retrieve me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You must be scared of the chilling cold of the underworld, you fools! Do you need someone experienced like me to guide you through here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What are you doing here!? We thought Ereshkigal captured you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. The underworld is like my backyard. I know how things work down here. I&#39;ve been here numerous times.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I did accidentally die, but before the gallû spirits came, I hid in the shadows. There, I held my breath and meditated, and then...Presence Concealment EX.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> After I got away from them, I was sitting here contemplating what to do, when you lot came! That&#39;s all!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He&#39;s super lively for a dead guy...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re the same as usual, Your Majesty!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You too, Fujimaru. Knowing how reckless you are, I knew you would come down to the underworld.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...It was a good thing he wasn&#39;t captured by Ereshkigal, but it ticks me off to see this guy so perky down here...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If you had been cursed like me, that would&#39;ve at least been interesting...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool. The curse of the underworld is only for the living. I&#39;m dead, so I needn&#39;t worry about any of that.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, that also means that I am subject to Ereshkigal&#39;s laws as well.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even if I wanted to return to Uruk, I wouldn&#39;t be able to leave the underworld without her permission.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And I don&#39;t think she&#39;d let me leave this world so easily either. So, you know what to do, right, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I, the king, command you to pass through the gates of the underworld, and punish that wretched Ereshkigal for me!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, yeah. That&#39;s why Fujimaru came here in the first place.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The order of things flip-flopped, but you&#39;re going to help us defeat Ereshkigal too, right, Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Leave it to me. I will show you the difference between that itty-bitty brat there, and me, the king.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> By the way, why did you shrink? Have you finally decided that your insignificance should be reflected in your appearance?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been telling you, it&#39;s Ereshkigal&#39;s curse!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Agh, jeez, I knew I shouldn&#39;t have come to save you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahaha. This fool, hahaha. You? Come to save me? Am I dreaming?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Did I somehow die AGAIN while I was down here and start hallucinating?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yeah, if that was the case, we could&#39;ve just left you here. Why don&#39;t you just drown in your own stupidity, Goldie?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re quite the swimmer, aren&#39;t you? You were so absorbed in swimming that a serpent stole your precious herb of immortality.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Argh, what a foul way of pointing out my traumatic past! So this really isn&#39;t a hallucination...This is the real Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But...that doesn&#39;t make sense.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If this isn&#39;t a dream, what is this slightly less irritating Ishtar doing here?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Are you saying something came over you? Or are you trying to be sweet to win over Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ugh, stop. Just stop talking, Goldie! I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, trying to win Fujimaru over!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, please, you two. Let&#39;s leave the Uruk-opera behind and head to the third gate. See, over there...</p><p><strong>Third Gate:</strong><br> ...Answer meee...Answer my question pleeease...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> How sad. It&#39;s been shouting all this time, but after being completely ignored, it lost its confidence...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh yes, that&#39;s right. You have my permission to speak, third gate. What do you ask?</p><p><strong>Third Gate:</strong><br> ...Who is more worthy of your trust and respect? Who is more worthy of victory?</p><p><strong>Third Gate:</strong><br> Who is a more suitable ally?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;ll be Ishtar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;ll be Gilgamesh.</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Third Gate:</strong><br> Gu...h...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahahaha! That was laughable! The ruler of the mountainous land of Aratta is no match for Uruk!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Try and come at me again!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Huh? Gilgamesh is in a really good mood! I never thought I&#39;d see him smile like that. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re in good mood, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Yes, yes. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve fought. I forgot my royalty and got a bit carried away, I suppose.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s Aratta?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe he&#39;s referring to the Lord of Aratta, the rival of Enmerkar, the first king of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Enmerkar came two generations before King Gilgamesh. He was also tricked by Inanna...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar cajoled him into attacking the land of Aratta for its abundant ore.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, is that what happened? Sorry, but I don&#39;t remember aaaaany of it☆</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...And shrunken again...Father would be so sad if he saw me like this...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Hey, Fujimaru, Doctor Roman!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Do you have something to remember this moment!? Like that clicking thing!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You should weep for me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Gagfh!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What the hell are you doing, fool!? That was some force! If Mash hadn&#39;t covered me, I would have fallen into the Abyss!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That was like a huge cat came at him with all the force of a freight train! That&#39;d...Yeah, that&#39;d push you over...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Your Majesty, what&#39;s the Abyss?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is there something lower than the underworld?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ah, the Abyss, yes. In Mesopotamia, there are the heavens and the earth, the underworld under the earth, and beneath that, the Abyss.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Abyss is a sea of nothingness. The gods Abzu and Tiamat came from that dark sea, and created Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You could call it the primordial sea that existed before life itself.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now that Enki, the god who managed the Abyss, has disappeared, there would be no returning if you fell into it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s where King Gilgamesh sought the mystic herb of immortality, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it...I heard that Enkidu also had some dealings here in the underworld, didn&#39;t they?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If I remember correctly, King Gilgamesh ordered Enkidu to go to the underworld, then Enkidu told him all about it when they returned.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (That smile says the king is trying to ignore something he doesn&#39;t want to remember! )</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty knowledgeable, Mash. But the truth is actually much worse than that.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Goldie over there was really into his new invention, a musical instrument, and had a party for three days and three nights.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ereshkigal was fed up with all the noise so she opened the gate to the underworld, just a little.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The king was pretty drunk, so he accidentally dropped his instrument into the hole.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> He was furious; you should have seen the tantrum he threw!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Enkidu couldn&#39;t just watch the king rage, so they went down to the underworld alone.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And so Enkidu went and took a look at the underworld, showed their gratitude to Ereshkigal, and returned to the surface.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Argh! This all happened because you kept asking for help! Something like, “There&#39;s a snake...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...in the Huluppu Tree! Help me! Waaaah! ” If I hadn&#39;t cut down that tree, I would never have made the instrument!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hold on a second. “Showed gratitude to Ereshkigal...”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Enkidu has some relationship with Ereshkigal?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Yes. Enkidu hated Ishtar, but was respectful to Ereshkigal.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Ereshkigal was the one who took in Enkidu&#39;s remains. We couldn&#39;t leave the remains of a weapon of the gods on the surface.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The thought was that they could rest in peace if they were entombed in the underworld. But...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I knew there was time before you lot appeared, so I visited Enkidu&#39;s grave. However, their remains had disappeared.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! So the young man that called himself Kingu is really Enkidu!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> A rebooted Enkidu...Is that it? But...Enkidu&#39;s soul was destroyed by the gods.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I can understand if it was as a Servant, but Enkidu couldn&#39;t have been revived as a living being in this era.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s just as you say Ishtar. That Enkidu isn&#39;t Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even though Enkidu was buried, there were things that still resided in the body. That is now what we see.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Buried, but something left in the body...? ...Is that possible? But if that&#39;s the case—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> He calls himself Kingu, right? Then just think of him as that.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Anyway, we can see the fourth gate now. Let&#39;s have fun with the next question we get.</p><p><strong>Fourth Gate:</strong><br> Answer me...Answer me...</p><p><strong>Fourth Gate:</strong><br> There is no reward in faith...Prayers are merely offerings...</p><p><strong>Fourth Gate:</strong><br> People do not hope for blessing from the gods, they simply offer their prayers and labors...They are slaves for life...</p><p><strong>Fourth Gate:</strong><br> In which case, answer...The fastidious goddess that has the right to accept such precious labor would be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fastidi...I can&#39;t really get a read. I guess it&#39;s Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Fourth Gate:</strong><br> DE...SP...AIR...YOU...ARE...BLIND...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ereshkigal.</p><p><strong>Fourth Gate:</strong><br> H...O...P...E...BEST...OF...LUCK...TO...YOU...</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, but I think that&#39;s enough! When did this turn into Whose Goddess Is It Anyway!? This is serious!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...? Doctor, is there a problem with that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As Ishtar said, they&#39;re all very important questions. This is really teaching me a lot.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What...did you say...!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No. Mash is becoming a bad girl...Ishtar&#39;s lifestyle is a bad influence on her...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Ereshkigal is the one asking weird questions. It&#39;s not my fault.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure about that. Ereshkigal&#39;s problems are your problems.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If the roles were reversed, I think you would have prepared the same questions.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s not true. I would have been much more clever and circumspect about asking stuff like this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (So you wouldn&#39;t really ask anything different! That&#39;s Ishtar for you! )</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ah! The gate shocked me again...I think I&#39;m getting used to this, which is kind of scary...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Fantastic. It was funny to start, but now it&#39;s becoming a problem...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We can&#39;t keep losing strength, even if it&#39;s Ishtar&#39;s. If things keep going like this, fighting Ereshkigal will be difficult...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just what level of divinity is Ereshkigal? Is she the same rank as you, Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No, she&#39;s not quite on Ishtar&#39;s level.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She&#39;s an old goddess like Ishtar, but in terms of raw power, she&#39;s not as impressive.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ishtar was a daughter of the heavens, so she got everything she wanted.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The gods spoiled her, and tended to her every beck and call.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Also, Ishtar got Enki, the god of the Abyss, drunk, and robbed him blind.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That was pretty bad. It was the greatest heist in the history of the gods. It was also pretty funny, even to the other gods.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Enki got completely smashed, and gave all of his divinity to Ishtar. When he woke up he had nothing left.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ishtar had already loaded all his wealth onto Maanna, and was on her way back to the surface.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Enki went into a panic and had his slaves chase after her, but the Boat of Heaven was far too fast.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Enki was in tears.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> He wrung his hands and screamed, warning that a stupid, bratty girl was going to run the heavens and the earth, and begged for help.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The gods and humans that were watching screamed out,</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “Take a look at that driving technique!? Who would have thought the Boat of Heaven could be used for drift racing! ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “No one can catch up to that! Surely her driving mastery will go down in legend as the Drunk and the Divine: Underworld Drift! No one in Uruk could ever be faster! ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I hate to admit it, but even I thought so too! Ishtar had been hiding her true colors up until then!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, whatever do you mean?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The Boat of Heaven&#39;s automatic transmission was broken that day, so I just switched to manual gear.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And I always carried nitro in my boat, just in case I needed it. Always.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What do you think, Fujimaru? THIS is the patron deity of Uruk. Now do you understand how I feel?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m starting to think that the curse is a divine punishment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ishtar is such a free spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In the end, the Boat of Heaven had engine trouble and stalled just before the harbor in Uruk. Tragedy was averted in the nick of time.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As you can see, this is the story of Ishtar, a goddess who coveted everything she saw. On the other hand, Ereshkigal did not desire anything.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...When the underworld was created, she was sent to become its ruler and foundation.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Someone had to maintain the underworld, and Ereshkigal was unlucky enough to have that responsibility thrust onto her.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ereshkigal had only just been born when she was cast into the underworld and became the mistress of the depths of the earth.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She managed the spirits of the dead for tens of thousands of years without being able to spend a moment on the surface or in the heavens.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...so sad. I wouldn&#39;t have thought to feel bad for her before,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> but I do now.... It&#39;s not just that she couldn&#39;t leave...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The worst part is that she couldn&#39;t see new worlds or meet new people.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In exchange, Ereshkigal became invincible in the underworld.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even the gods cannot go against her laws in the underworld. Just ask that tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny girl over there.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But outside the underworld, her special privilege disappears. She&#39;s about mid-level in terms of divinity, I&#39;d say.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Also, if she&#39;s up against someone who&#39;s alive, then she has to kill them first, or the laws of the underworld won&#39;t go into effect.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So the only ones that aren&#39;t affected by Ereshkigal&#39;s laws are Fujimaru and Mash.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. So that&#39;s why you were waiting for Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmph. Someone who&#39;s alive and can put up a fight, basically.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> My only concern was that Fujimaru might get killed by the gallû spirits the moment [♂ he /♀ she] entered the underworld.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But it seems that Ishtar prevented that. She dropped to the underworld with you and protected you when you were most vulnerable...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Did you get a bit less dumb? Maybe your negative qualities like debauchery and stinginess canceled each other out and made a positive?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Who you calling debauched? As if! You don&#39;t know me, Goldie! So stop talking!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And I&#39;m not stingy; I&#39;m financially responsible!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I have a reason for collecting jewels! Don&#39;t believe everything Goldie says, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Fifth Gate:</strong><br> Answer me...Answer me...</p><p><strong>Fifth Gate:</strong><br> Existence is the practice of curtailing waste. Living is the practice of cultivating waste.</p><p><strong>Fifth Gate:</strong><br> It is the duty of the wise to eat finely, to scheme, and to find happiness.</p><p><strong>Fifth Gate:</strong><br> However, listen. Unlimited intake of nourishment invites excess flab. If you were to live your life, that would be...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fat, meat, and Ishtar...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re being judgmental Fujimaru! Not all Chinese restaurants are bad for you!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You can just exercise after you eat a lot of fats! The same with meat!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You can achieve balance that way! Forget excess flab on your waist, you can prevent it in your heart!</p><p><strong>Fifth Gate:</strong><br> FATFATFATFATFATFATFATFATFAT!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ereshkigal is good for the liver.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, home cooking is good for the liver. That&#39;s the secret to longevity and better sleep.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> White rice and barley rice should be a 1: 6 ratio. There&#39;s no problem with eating meat, but chicken tenders are recommended daily.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Plus there are certain vegetables that have a bunch of antioxidants which prevent aging. Make sure you eat a balanced meal!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Really!? I&#39;m going to eat so many red peppers now!</p><p><strong>Fifth Gate:</strong><br> GOOD...TRULY...GOD...TIER...</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ugh, I&#39;m now palm-sized...This is so pathetic...I can&#39;t even cry...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Among all Sumerian gods, no, among all gods everywhere, I&#39;m probably the only one to have to endure something so awful!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How about you start being more modest?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re right...For starters, I&#39;ll take my fabulousness down a bit...And I&#39;ll be a tad kinder to everyone...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ve come to understand a tiny bit how the weak feel...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I now know that being protected is honestly a nice feeling...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Think you&#39;ll turn back to normal once we defeat Ereshkigal?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I hope so. But knowing her, I&#39;m afraid she would be willing to sacrifice her life just to keep me like this.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If so, I&#39;d have to destroy myself, and take the world with me...Oh, but since I get the entire treasury of Babylon,</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> it&#39;d be a shame if I didn&#39;t use it up before I self-destruct...I wonder how many millennia it will take?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hey. You there. No time for idle chatter.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We&#39;ve passed through all seven gates. The hall ahead is Ereshkigal&#39;s palace.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ereshkigal is a member of the Three Goddess Alliance. So, she&#39;s someone you have to defeat no matter what.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now that I am helping you, victory is guaranteed. That&#39;s all fine and good. However...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I shall leave it to Fujimaru to decide how we deal with her after we defeat her. Think well on how to handle Ereshkigal.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...the palace of Kur...Um...It&#39;s just a wasteland.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If this is a palace, this is all too—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s what the underworld is. Not one gorgeous thing exists here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Ereshkigal? O queen of the gallû spirits who gazes at the sky of darkness?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...You speak as if you know. You are merely a demigod king.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Fear, pray, and despair, humans.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I am the keeper of death, ruler of the underworld, the one who tramples the sacred mountain...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I am Ereshkigal of the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that&#39;s Ereshkigal...! I&#39;m getting chills down my spine, Master...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can see the temperature hasn&#39;t changed, but I feel cold all over!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> According to our measurements, current atmospheric conditions at your location are...Impossible, the barometric pressure is at 500 hPa!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s the equivalent of being atop a mountain over 5,000 meters tall! That place isn&#39;t cold! It&#39;s high up!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The temperature drop is from adiabatic cooling. It&#39;s probably minus six degrees Celsius now!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s the lower limit for biological activity! Not only will you suffer from decompression sickness, but your pulmonary cells will explode!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You must defeat Ereshkigal before that happens, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...So frail. Simply revealing myself to you is enough to destroy you.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> The commander of Chaldea seems to be a coward. How...disappointing.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ha. You act like the big bad boss of a mountain. That&#39;s a little silly, even for you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> First of all, there&#39;s no one anywhere who wouldn&#39;t be scared after taking a look at you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Death, maggots, mold, and filth. It&#39;s like the air inside a coffin took shape.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s what you are, Ereshkigal.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> All living animals are created to fear you.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Oh? Did I hear a little bug buzzing about? Why, look, there&#39;s a tiny, pitiful goddess down there.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> How can something so small make so much noise? Shall I crush you between my fingers, little bug?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hah, so this is the real you! How pathetic!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You hate the beautiful because you are ugly. You place your throne at the top of a sacred mountain because nobody visits.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re just taking your issues out on everyone else! To think you&#39;re my other half...Ugh, it&#39;s so pathetic I could cry!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Sure, if you want to kill me, go on ahead! Right afterwards, you&#39;ll be nothing but the ugliest woman in Sumer!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Just like before, no matter how tiny the rest of you is, your stupid mouth is cavernous. Fine. You said I was ugly?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> It seems absurd to reveal myself to the likes of you, but a goddess cannot let an insult stand!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Very well, I shall reveal my true form to enrap–You know what, no! I&#39;m sick of talking like this!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give you a special peek! Be prepared! This is my true form as a goddess!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha–</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Geh.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Aha!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Humph, are you surprised? You&#39;re surprised, right? You look surprised!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> The guise of a gallû spirit was only a temporary one, of course!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I never showed my true self even to the Sumerian gods. Look upon me and be shocked, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Uh, okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Wh-what&#39;s with that reaction...You look terribly disappointed...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Why? Isn&#39;t this how it goes? The part where you look at me and see your dear friend?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Human books said that was SURE to work! Don&#39;t you have even the slightest bit of romance in you!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai, you&#39;re not surprised!? Ereshkigal&#39;s guise is, well...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I mean, I knew.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Huh!? You knew? How!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is the fourth time we&#39;ve met.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Y-yeah...But...You knew the whole time?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> That you were speaking to me, not that louse, on those nights?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> But, how? When did you realize this!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You transformed when you sneezed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Towards the end, you weren&#39;t hiding it at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Wh-Wh-What...!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Y-You knew, and you let me say said such embarrassing things? I said them all to you?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Noooooooooooo!!! This wasn&#39;t how it was supposed to be! Not like this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It seems Ereshkigal has collapsed, cradling her head like you have dealt a blow. Do you want to defeat her now, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Unfortunately we&#39;ve no choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> And miss the show?</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not how it goes! My plans are ruined, but that is that, and this is this!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> The plan to kill you here hasn&#39;t changed. Two more days until Gorgon assaults Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Before that, I will conquer Uruk and seize its Greater Grail. Then, the world of humans will be over!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Every last human on the surface will be trapped in the underworld, and become my property.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> That is my choice. Ereshkigal&#39;s very first choice of her own free will.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Fujimaru. If you&#39;re going to stand in my way, I will show no mercy, even to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ereshkigal...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t look at me like that. It makes it harder for me to kill you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, Eree...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I-in any case, brace yourself. Now that you&#39;ve come to the underworld, my power is absolute!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Your pardon. Going to interrupt from the sidelines, Ereshkigal. I never was great at caring about the mood.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...What? I had no intention of killing you. You ended up here because you worked yourself to death.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I have no need for you. You&#39;re a nuisance in the underworld, so go get yourself killed by Gorgon or something.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh heh, quite the mouth you&#39;ve got. You really are similar. You two are like sisters.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Shut up! I&#39;m not an embarrassing naif like she is!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> What!? What part of me do you think is embarrassing!? I&#39;m a terrifying goddess of death!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Save the goddess improv sketch for later. Do as much as you please when we don&#39;t have to see it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ereshkigal. You are the patron deity of Kutha, and yet joined the Three Goddess Alliance.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of all your sins, none is greater. None even comes close.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Though I may be dead for the time being, I can still convict you under my royal authority.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Invaders are meant to be defeated by force, but the world itself judges traitors to their own.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That is how royal authority works. You should be fully aware of that.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Yes. If it is a king who has gained Dingir, he can punish even a god by exchanging everything he has to do so.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> That is the rule of our world. So what? Are you going to kill me in exchange for your life?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...That will depend on your answer. Now, answer me, Ereshkigal!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Why did you join the Three Goddess Alliance!? Have you abandoned your duty to protect Sumer&#39;s people and culture!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Of all the things I thought you&#39;d ask! Make no mistake, king of Uruk!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Neither my role nor my obligations have changed one bit! I am Ereshkigal, the one entrusted with the underworld!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I exist to manage all humans...all souls within the underworld. That is my destiny!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I have no regret or remorse for dedicating all I have to that task!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> If you bar my way, I will destroy you with my Authority!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh. A marvelous statement. If so, I have learned all I need to know about your sins.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now, present your head so we can make this clean! Your defeat will serve as punishment for your sins!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Just what I hoped for. I&#39;ll skewer you all on my lance without tormenting you.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...But before that, I&#39;ll ask one question. Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I have managed the souls of the dead here for a numbingly long time. Entertainment, joy, sadness, friends to call my own...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t have any of those, while I watched my other half fly freely through the heavens.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> You accuse ME of a crime? After all this, you point your finger and say collecting souls is wrong?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Is nobody going to commend me for all the work I&#39;ve done...a job I did all this time all by myself?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, Ereshkigal, you&#39;re not at fault here.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! I knew you would understand!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Heh, hehe. Ahahahahahahahahaha! Then, I no longer have anything to fear!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I was not in the wrong! If even one human agrees with me, then...I am true righteousness!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ereshkigal is transforming...! Your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I shall kill you. First, you&#39;ll die! And then afterwards, listen to my story...!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> That is your responsibility, as the only one in this world who sees that I&#39;m not evil!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Not interested. You&#39;re just fulfilling your role.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Eh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You don&#39;t understand, fool? That one isn&#39;t foolish enough to compliment what should be normal.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine to lament the obligations given to you. It&#39;s also fine to abandon them and pursue an alternate path.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, bemoaning the obligations that you chose to uphold dutifully is evil,</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> and to praise that pain is an insult only to yourself!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What should be praised is the triumphs you achieved! The pain in your heart is for you alone.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Nobody else can understand your wounds. But your work is worth praising.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...That is what Fujimaru is telling you.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Fine. I will make you regret such an audacious response.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I am Ereshkigal. A goddess sacrificed by the gods to protect the silence of death.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> This hatred, this pain...You called it insignificant. Now I shall make EACH of you feel it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ereshkigal is transforming...! Your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Sing the song of pain in the depths of the earth! Try with all your might to correct what you call my folly!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Aaaaaaaaah!!!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Nice! I&#39;m back to my normal size! Now victory for Fujimaru is guaranteed!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And it looks like my bonds have come undone, too! I must return to my physical body in Uruk immediately...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But it seems there&#39;s still a certain matter to take care of. Go ahead, finish her off, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Yes. You still need to cut my head off.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> This is a just end for a goddess who tried to take control of Uruk after being cajoled by the King of Mages&#39; flattering words.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It seems you have accepted your fate. Why not at least give us an excuse to spare you?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Fujimaru sees everything in a positive light, so if you say you&#39;re going to turn over a new leaf, I&#39;m sure [♂ he&#39;ll /♀ she&#39;ll] consider it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Ereshkigal...</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Unnecessary. I will not beg for my life.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> You are the goddess of fertility, so if given the chance, you would survive until the end. But I&#39;m different.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> For the goddess of death to reject death, that would be a foul thing indeed. As the goddess who captured many souls, I shall die here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ereshkigal...Master. It seems her mind is made up. I don&#39;t know what to say.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When a person doesn&#39;t deny their guilt and seeks death...What should we do in such a situation?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Simple. We ask her reasons.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think Ereshkigal is evil.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Humph. It&#39;s too late to talk about such matters now.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I told you before. I intended to wipe out everyone in Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I was going to gather all of their souls here in the underworld and then become the one who rules them all.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Gorgon wants to annihilate the human race out of vengeance, since humans stole everything from her.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I tried to exterminate humans out of a desire to dominate. Wouldn&#39;t you agree there is no greater evil than that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Surely that wasn&#39;t your true motive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Ereshkigal, you&#39;re a liar.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re persistent. Just lop off my head already.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> As the queen of the land of the dead, I lost to humans. As a goddess, I lost to Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...No. The fact that I didn&#39;t kill you when we first met in Kutha had already ruined my plans.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I despise the living. If you&#39;re not going to become one of my dead, don&#39;t try to understand me.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...Fool. Such behavior ill becomes a goddess, and leads her nowhere.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! Senpai, there&#39;s someone behind Ereshkig—Huh!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...N-no. I...I—</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Child. So immature, so stubborn. Save your petulance for another time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ereshkigal...! Who the hell are you!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar&#39;s arrow did not hit...! Who is that old man...!?</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Calm yourselves. Look, and see. What this sword severed was not her bond to life, but to this misbegotten alliance.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I&#39;m stunned! You didn&#39;t just cut me in half!? Like in myth!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ereshkigal...! Master, Ereshkigal isn&#39;t injured!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So who are you, old man? The only living human in the underworld is Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You may not be dead, but no ordinary man could have done what you just have.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t me. Nor the Mage King. Nor Chaldea. Old man...who called you here?</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> A good question. Little and less has been achieved here, and so I have come from the Abyss to set events in motion. I appear here as a friend from another land.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Ereshkigal. You hide the truth with so many lies.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> If you can yet feel shame, answer me: Why have you striven to create a land of the dead?</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> O caretaker of souls, do you not love humanity? Is that not why you sought to claim them as your own?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Obviously.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...! Wh-what?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Of course not. I only love the things I own. Only my souls locked up in cages!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Look at this land! A sky without light, a surface without reflection, mud without budding flowers!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> There is no pleasure to be had here. There is nothing. I don&#39;t even know what the souls are saying!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> But there is silence and tranquility. When it comes to peaceful repose of the dead, this land has no equal!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care about the humans and their lives on the surface. I only love those who fall to this land!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> So I could never feel any love for the people on the surface!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I disagree.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> W-with what? I speak only the truth. The only humans I am interested in are dead ones—</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Mistress of the underworld...Bloody flower consigned to the depths of the earth, even you know the lie in your words.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> You do not love the dead. You love all humans, each fated to die.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Death was gentle, not a terrible thing in your hands. You gave yourself to your duty in safeguarding the souls in your care.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> You cast your lot with the alliance meaning to safeguard as many souls as you could, protected here in your realm.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Though none may understand, though you may stand alone in a sea of souls, you sought to keep them safe here...</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> ...Here in your kingdom of silence.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...But...there were so many that I...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What are you talking about? The bodies of those who died from exhaustion are all stored away.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If you release them from your soul cages, they&#39;ll all come right back to life.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Really!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Obviously. Compared to the damage Gorgons inflicted, your death toll by exhaustion is negligible.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The population of Kutha is nine hundred, and there are three hundred injured in Uruk! That&#39;s just 1,200 people in total!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Such a small number could fit comfortably beneath the ziggurat. It&#39;s that simple.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In terms of actual damage done, you&#39;re at the bottom of the list in the alliance, Ereshkigal.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Th-that&#39;s shocking in its own way! I tried as hard as I could!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Well, you can have the last word. Say something, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I want you to fight Gorgon with me.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Such power, such destruction...That&#39;s...You&#39;re asking a lot, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...I could&#39;ve sworn you were already on our side...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> R-really? I had no such intention, but that was what you&#39;ve been going for this whole time?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Then I have no other choice. After all, I am a goddess. I-I-I-I shall accept that responsibility.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then you&#39;ll help us fight Gorgon too, Ereshkigal!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does this mean the end of the Three Goddess Alliance!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> W-well, yes. Otherwise, that scary old man would have...Huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, the old man in the robe has disappeared! He was here just a minute ago!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...? Uh...Who? What old man in a robe? I didn&#39;t see anyone who fits that description...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...So you swear you&#39;ll never attack Uruk again? And while you&#39;re at it, form a contract with Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I will never attack Uruk again, but I cannot form a contract with Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I have my pride, Ishtar. I&#39;m just paying off my debt by helping Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I cannot offer a contract until after that. I am the Queen of Kur. Unlike you, I don&#39;t allow myself to fall into debt.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> A contract should deal with both parties equally, in a fair manner.... Therefore, I must first prove my worth by saving the world.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh. Well, that&#39;s bold of you. What will you do, specifically?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m going to start thinking about that right now! I should have plenty of chances! Probably! ...Maybe!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They&#39;re two of a kind...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really understand what Ereshkigal is trying to say...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, you see...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> “If Fujimaru gets in a pinch, I&#39;ll make a cool entrance and repay your kindness that way. But wait until something like that happens. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s what she&#39;s saying.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll wait with anticipation.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Y-yes. Me too. I&#39;ll wait for the time when you get in a bind so you can summon me for help.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> And so, I will return to managing the underworld! I will grant you permission to depart, so go back right away!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Of course, I will keep a careful watch for the Gorgon battle.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Ishtar? If you commit a blunder and wink out of existence, I&#39;ll take over your vessel for you.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> So I hope you die in vain real soon. See you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I suppose all&#39;s well that ends well. Time for me to go back to Uruk, then.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It is almost time for the showdown with Gorgon. Let&#39;s hurry.... But there is one last thing.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ishtar. According to myth, you descended into the underworld.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure you couldn&#39;t help but notice Ereshkigal had a grudge against you. So, knowing that, why did you come?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s the biggest mystery of all Inanna&#39;s anecdotes. I&#39;m curious, too. So why, Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Why? Well, because I didn&#39;t like the situation, of course.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It was the story of how the gods ordered her to never leave the underworld. I had to do something after hearing a sorry story like that.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I wanted to tell her, “Just drop your duties in the underworld, and leave. ”</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I went to meet Ereshkigal. To give her that advice.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh...Fwahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! And then you were stripped naked and murdered. Perfect! You&#39;re hopeless, woman!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Still, starting a quarrel like that is so you! No wonder Ereshkigal got mad!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “Easier said than done! ” is what she would&#39;ve said!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s so Ishtar.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But in a way, it worked.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I know, right? So this is a win for me. No matter what form, she did leave the underworld.</p><h2 id="section-15-decisive-battle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-15-decisive-battle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 15: Decisive Battle</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived at Uruk, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good work on your nonstop trek back from Kutha right after emerging from the underworld!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah, seriously. Before I was summoned as a Servant, I never thought I&#39;d be forced to walk this much.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Had I known, I would&#39;ve brought a carriage with me.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> My boat only has room for one, sorry☆</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, I would have been fine with having just Fujimaru on board, but “No way, not without Mash” [♂ he /♀ she] says...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, should I call for my winged serpents? I&#39;d have to start with getting them accustomed to humans, though!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A winged serpent gondola, huh! That&#39;s new. Sounds fun! ...Oh?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Welcome back, Fujimaru. Merlin, you&#39;re still alive, too. That&#39;s good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re back, Ana.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. I&#39;m glad you are all safe. Siduri has informed me of the situation.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sorry to leave you behind, Ana.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...No, I&#39;m the one who is sorry...For not being helpful when it was needed. Shame on me.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Siduri informed me of the situation. I guess you managed to seize control over the second goddess.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have returned, Ana.... Um, also.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your hood is down...Are you okay? I know you&#39;ve had it up all this time...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. As the people of Uruk take such good care of us, I didn&#39;t think it was a good idea to keep concealing my face...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...And I was told that it&#39;d be better to show my face. So, I took it off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re as cute as I expected!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Nice to “see” you.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. I look forward to working with you again.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Now excuse me. I was asked to herd some bulls at the farm, so I&#39;ll be going.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh is awaiting you at the ziggurat. I&#39;ll see you again at the Chaldean Embassy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ana basically flew over to the farm.... She seemed very happy.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah. Something really good for Ana must have happened. I don&#39;t know the circumstances, but I&#39;m glad to see her like that.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I was the one that brought her here to Uruk. It would be great if it leads to something better.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s bustling! Streets are full of people. Everyone is doing their best, and still smiling!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s totally different from the last time I was here, yes! I didn&#39;t know Uruk was such a charming city!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Today they seem even livelier than usual.... Hey, what&#39;s that giant seal?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hah! What is that?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> “Celebrating the King&#39;s Third Return From the Underworld! ” it says!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Look, free jerky! ...Hang on, what are all those ugly clay things!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> “The king battles a fairy in the underworld. ” “The king falls off a cliff in the underworld. ” “The king strikes a proud, triumphant pose in the underworld. ” These are too funny!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...And this clay companion of his is...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yup, it&#39;s you, Fujimaru! No doubt about it! I mean, it has a really cute face!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...He didn&#39;t waste time bragging, huh...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course. It&#39;s an important role of the king to relate his epic tales.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Whenever he comes back from the underworld, the priests won&#39;t let him go. They record his stories for three days and three nights.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It looks like King Gilgamesh is all prepared, too. Let&#39;s hurry over to the ziggurat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We have two more days, including today, before Gorgon&#39;s attack. We don&#39;t have much time left.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ah, the Chaldeans have returned! Let&#39;s have our strategy meeting for the Gorgon attack! Siduri!</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> You have all done splendid work on your last mission. Given the way the king is, I shall convey our gratitude on his behalf.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> We have prepared a small celebration at the embassy, so once the meeting is over, let us head that way.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What? I have heard nothing about this! Hmm, so this is our battle plan? Let&#39;s see...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...My name is not on this! Heh, you careless fool. Surely you forgot to write it down?</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> My king, you cannot go. Your schedule after this meeting is full. Now, everyone, let&#39;s get up to speed on the current situation.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Currently all remaining forces have gathered at Uruk&#39;s Northern Wall to prepare for the imminent invasion of Gorgon&#39;s main army.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> The Demonic Beasts have gathered in the Cedar Forest. They number roughly 100,000. That&#39;s over ten times the size of our force.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> The Northern Wall has been fortified repeatedly, but once they invade, it won&#39;t last more than half a day.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> On top of that, if Gorgon herself appears, the Northern Wall will almost certainly collapse under her attack.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> With no wall, the soldiers will find it hard to retreat, and will likely be swallowed up by the waves of Demonic Beasts.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...So Gorgon has bred that many Demonic Beasts, huh? She must have concentrated on producing enough for a sure win...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hmm...For a “goddess of vengeance,” her tactics are oddly human, yes. She knows relying on sheer numbers is the best way to win...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Humanity cannot win if our forces are overwhelmed in terms of quality AND quantity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In the face of such a massive attack, we won&#39;t be able to defend. That means the only thing we can do is attack their base.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We of Uruk will buy you some time–half a day–at the Northern Wall. While we do that, you head to Gorgon&#39;s base: the Blood Temple, also called Blood Fort.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It lies in the underground lake deep within the Cedar Forest.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s the same as Quetzalcoatl&#39;s Sun Temple.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we can stop the temple from functioning, Gorgon will lose much of her Authority.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That should give us the chance we need to defeat Gorgon.... But do we really expect everything to go to plan?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> First of all, how are you going to destroy the Blood Fort? Humans can&#39;t even get through its entrance, you know?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I flew around that area a few times to check things out. That thing is more like a fortified mountain than a temple.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And in that “mountain” is a cave where she&#39;s made her nest. It&#39;s like she&#39;s an ant.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Protecting the entrance to that cave is a Bounded Field. So, normally, you&#39;d need to organize some sort of siege, right?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s where the Axe of Marduk comes in. It should be able to destroy the Blood Fort and carve a path through to the inside.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> This morning, a mysterious Servant calling themselves the Jaguar Parcel Service delivered the axe to us.</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> Per the king&#39;s orders, we sent it directly to the Northern Wall. The Servant left a message for Lady Quetzalcoatl, too:</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> “That last job burned meowt! This is pawsitively the worst! ”</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You can totally ignore that, yes. Please make them work even harder, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Still, there&#39;s a slight problem: That axe is heavy. Too heavy to carry easily.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Even if the winged serpents reach the Northern Wall, will they be able to fly to the Cedar Forest in half a day?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Besides, the Demonic Beasts would most likely shoot them down midway.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Then we should throw it. You can do that much, sun goddess, can&#39;t you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s asking way too much!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That would be a bit, uh...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s thirty kilometers from the Northern Wall to the temple? Well, if it&#39;s just throwing the axe, I can do it, yes...</p><p><strong>Siduri:</strong><br> You can do it!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Still, it&#39;s no use. I can&#39;t just attack that place.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The alliance rules are still in effect. The members are forbidden from attacking each other, yes.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Any goddess who breaks the pact–like with an act of violence–would be completely annihlated, yes!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How petty!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just say, “The pact is absolute, yes! But I don&#39;t care, no! I&#39;ll just break it and die! ” What, are you not man enough to do that!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I am not, no! I&#39;m a goddess, after all, yes! You&#39;re the petty one, king!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> To begin with, you don&#39;t have enough gold to call yourself king, no! Only one golden arm? That&#39;s a little cheap, yes!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How dare you bring that up! ...Hardly surprising, though, considering you&#39;re the king of the City of Gold.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Anyway, I just haven&#39;t shown my full strength yet, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> My true guise will blow you out of this world...Figuratively, I mean. From surprise. Not like that design on the sarcophagus of Palenque.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Aaand here we go with the back-and-forth insults again. Gilgamesh is like...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s a scary king, but he seems to love arguing and insults...That may be the biggest difference between him and King Ozymandias.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...The latter is a god-king, and he rules as such. There&#39;s nothing divine about the way King Gilgamesh acts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They are both marvelous kings, but they&#39;re both...intense. It must be hard for those around either of them...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Anyway, enough talk of gold. Both of you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The real question here–which none of you have bothered to ask–is how we&#39;ll get the Axe of Marduk to the temple. Aaand the answer is: I&#39;ll take care of it!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You will? Are you going to carry the axe with magecraft?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No, no, that&#39;s impossible. It&#39;s a divine weapon; it repels human magecraft.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;d barely be able to do anything with it...Maybe levitate it a little and just drop it, but that&#39;s about it...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Only skilled transporters like winged serpents and goddesses like yourself would be able to carry it.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So, how about a plan like this: First, Fujimaru and I sneak into the Cedar Forest and head to the temple.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Once we&#39;re close enough to the temple, I&#39;ll give you the signal, and you just throw the axe to me!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take care of the rest somehow. Probably.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Okay, so let me just take a bit of this red cloth from my staff, and... There. Wrap this around the axe.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The cloth and my staff are one and the same. Even if your aim is a bit off, the axe should reach me.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Mm, that will work, yes! Are you okay with that, king?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I hate to rely on Merlin, but that&#39;s a good middle ground.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Any objections, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not really.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I feel like there&#39;s no other choice.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Right, then. Let&#39;s go through this one last time for you fools!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We have two days left until the deadline Gorgon set. We&#39;ll never win, though, if we just sit around and wait for her big invasion.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Therefore, we will move out tomorrow, right at dawn.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Chaldea&#39;s heroes, led by Fujimaru, will enter the Cedar Forest, plunging into enemy territory.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> At the same time, we&#39;ll begin our diversion at the Demonic Front.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have squads at the Northern Wall to lure the Demonic Beasts away.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That will allow Fujimaru and company to make their way through the Cedar Forest to the entrance to the Blood Fort.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> At Merlin&#39;s signal, Quetzalcoatl will throw the Axe of Marduk to him.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Merlin will then use the axe to smash the temple open.... What follows should be obvious.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fujimaru heads deep within the shrine as quickly as possible, faces the goddess Gorgon, and wins.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I shall call this Operation Marduk Blitz! Keep in mind, the fate of the Northern Wall rests on this battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wow! All this...for us!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahaha! Indeed it is! It&#39;s my way of being considerate!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Your work in the underworld was quite something! If I die again, I know who to call!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Your Majesty, why did you enter the battle!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Forgive me...It was just the flow of things! I couldn&#39;t help but get excited!</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Hmm.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The only thing left to do is return to the Chaldean Embassy, get things ready, then head over to the Northern Wall...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Are you staying here, King Gilgamesh? It will be the decisive battle for humanity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course. I can give orders from here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If–and I do only mean “if”–you fail to accomplish your task, the next battle will be here in Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If Uruk falls, Mesopotamia will meet its end. What kind of king would I be if I wasn&#39;t there for it?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I see. You really are going to be the last line of defense. I always knew Uruk was humanity&#39;s oldest fortress city...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But now I see how it came to be that way. Its roots. Its origin.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> However, Kingu is on Gorgon&#39;s side.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He is the complicating factor for this Singularity. Which means he could be a tougher opponent than Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I think you&#39;re the only one who can stop that impostor. But even so, you won&#39;t come to the Northern Wall?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So tedious! If I&#39;m to die in this battle, it&#39;ll be at this ziggurat!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I will entrust Quetzalcoatl with intercepting this Kingu! He is not one of the three goddesses. That pact doesn&#39;t apply to him.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that right, Quetzalcoatl?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Sí, sure thing.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> In any case, I can&#39;t accompany you to the Blood Fort. I&#39;ll handle Kingu at the Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I see. If you&#39;re okay with it, that&#39;s that. Then, is this farewell, Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> By defeating Gorgon, the crisis will be averted for now. The King of Mages&#39; Grail will be retrieved, and this era will not collapse.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And the job you gave us ends there, right?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Indeed. Impressive you held out for this long. Be well till this world&#39;s end, Mage of Flowers.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You, too. If your legend is to remain, I&#39;ll see you again in the distant future.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Such a huge spread, thanks to Siduri! This is quite the little party!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, what a joyous occasion. Our once-quiet lounge is now overflowing with people.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I guess this is the result of helping around the city. Food, flowers, booze. They&#39;re all gifts from Uruk civilians.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure this crowd is making Ana nervous. I&#39;ll go up to her room and check on her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We have a bit of time till we depart. You guys should relax.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Hey, good work! I heard of your adventures in the underworld! I heard you helped out King Gilgamesh this time?</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Thanks. On behalf of the citizens of Uruk, we are grateful.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> ...You know, when this embassy was first made, we were all disgusted, questioning what good outsiders could possibly do...</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> But we were fools for that! We thought that we should do something to repay you for all you&#39;ve done.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> We talked it over in the market, and next thing you know, well, here we are.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s a bit rowdy right before your departure, but we wanted to see you guys off.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Oh, a handshake! That&#39;s a handshake! The thing Fujimaru and the others are always doing!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do it, too! Let me shake your hand! I&#39;m part of the operation, but this is an advance celebration!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> You guys never cease to amaze me. Like that case with the hundred crocodiles living in the river!</p><p><strong>E：Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Nah, that&#39;s nothing compared to them getting rid of the beehive at our place. I panicked, thinking that it was the end of the world.</p><p><strong>E：Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> It was a swarm of bees that made the room dark as night!</p><p><strong>E：Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> When Mash charged in at the end with her shield at the ready...What a shock that was for me! ...From the bees&#39; venom, that is!</p><p><strong>F：Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Hey, did we talk about Fujimaru transporting the ale? We haven&#39;t? Then listen up, it was amazing!</p><p><strong>F：Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> The three varieties from Isin, Umma, and Girsu got all mixed up with no labels, and we couldn&#39;t tell them apart.</p><p><strong>F：Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> It&#39;d take three days to sort, but then their flavor would be lost. That&#39;s when these folks used their sharp wits...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Everyone is coming one after another to greet us.... It makes me happy, but also a bit sad.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Previous Singularities were journeys, but this time we stayed in one place for a long time...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It almost feels as if everyone is celebrating for us as citizens of Uruk.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We went through a lot...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s farewell to the embassy...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;d have liked to clean up in the end...Huh? Fou?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I see. Senpai, there is apparently someone outside. And that person is debating whether or not to enter...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go see who it is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me. Do you have something for the embassy?</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> Oh...I&#39;m so glad. So this is the Chaldean Embassy...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Senpai...this old lady&#39;s eyes...)</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> As you can see, my old age has taken its toll on my eyesight.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever walk outside again, but I came here wanting to give thanks one last time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thanks, you say...? You mean, to us?</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right. To that little girl. That girl really treated me well.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> I&#39;m rather stubborn, you see. I kept my flower shop open, pretending not to hear my family&#39;s opposition.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> Yes, just a formality. I couldn&#39;t be at the storefront. I couldn&#39;t attract customers.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> My grandchildren were so kind in bringing those flowers to me, but all I did every day was let them wilt. But then that girl came to help me out.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> Sometimes these blind eyes can feel the light. The past few days, I felt like I was young again.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> But then I, too, was hit by that illness. I thought I was going to die...until yesterday.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> My family had given up. They had tried to let me depart. I accepted it, thinking I&#39;d lived long enough.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> But, that girl clung onto my body. “This lady is still alive so don&#39;t bury her,” she said.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> That must be why. I was about to disappear in the underworld, but I started to feel like I could live a bit longer.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> When I woke up, she was right at my side. I touched her face for the first time then...</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> And I was so surprised. I didn&#39;t know she was so beautiful. Such a waste to hide it under cloth.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> I told her, she would become the most beautiful girl in town, and that&#39;s why she should keep her head up...</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> But I really am getting old. I should have at least given her a floral headpiece.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> So today, I came out by myself. I wanted to give this to her, to say thanks for everything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Understood. Thank you. We&#39;ll make sure Ana gets it.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> Good. Thank you.... Oh, I&#39;m so glad. You sound like a kind girl too.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> That girl was quiet, awkward, and timid.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> But with you folks nearby, I&#39;m sure she had a lot of fun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We hope so, yes. That&#39;d make us happy too. Thank you so much, ma&#39;am.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you for being kind to Ana. I&#39;m sure she was happy to have met someone like you too.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> You think so? Well, then my long life was worth living.</p><p><strong>Old Lady:</strong><br> Even though I&#39;m an old woman whose time is almost up, I was able to help someone else again...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Uruk Gatekeeper:</strong><br> Why, if it isn&#39;t the heroes of Chaldea. I take it you&#39;re departing for the Northern Wall today?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I&#39;m sorry to part with everyone who celebrated for us, but we must reach the Northern Wall by tonight.</p><p><strong>Uruk Gatekeeper:</strong><br> By tonight!? You really don&#39;t have much time. I apologize for holding you up.</p><p><strong>Uruk Gatekeeper:</strong><br> Please be careful. May the goddess Ishtar protect you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You stay well too, gatekeeper.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (...That goddess is actually right next to us...)</p><hr><p><strong>Uruk Gatekeeper:</strong><br> Oh, Ana, you be careful too. I finally got a glimpse of your face.</p><p><strong>Uruk Gatekeeper:</strong><br> You are a lovely young lady. I am reminded once again that my memory has its benefits. (Smile)</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Gatekeeper, you should be more alert. You&#39;ll be caught off guard in that state.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Though, now that we&#39;re headed to the Northern Wall, Demonic Beasts will never reach here.</p><p><strong>Uruk Gatekeeper:</strong><br> Of course. As always, I eagerly await your return.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, it&#39;s a...carriage! A carriage is coming! This late in the game, a carriage appears out of nowhere!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Merlin, what is this!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I summoned it with magecraft, of course! Spending half a day walking to the Northern Wall would be suuuch a pain!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where was this before!?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, you know...I can&#39;t just bring out something that doesn&#39;t belong to this era on a whim!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Come come, no time to waste! Hold on tight!</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! Time-out, folks! Keep your eyes on the road!</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Hello, look ahead! About three kilometers ahead! Local delinquents are after you!</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> How do I know what&#39;s up several kilometers ahead? Because I&#39;m watching all of you from the sky, meow!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master! This voice...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s a bird!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s a plI mean, a flying boat!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s the sound of the rotten soul of a jaguar, yes! We passed that twerp just now!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh, Kuku, your winged serpents are too slow! Oh, ow, ouch, no beak! Stop pecking!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I know you guys are doing your best. I know it&#39;s purrty rough to have no rest for four whole days.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But hold out a bit longer! If we don&#39;t deliver by tomorrow, the king won&#39;t reward us!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wow, look at them carrying that axe! An aerial transport of three hundred winged serpents is quite a sight!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I agree, but pay attention to the danger up ahead! I threw this carriage together in a hurry...It won&#39;t hold up in a fight!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ishtar, you can fly, so you take care of this! Clear our path of obstacles!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hahaha. Da Vinci is next to me saying,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The best thing Merlin ever made was that fake arm. One rocket shot from my Bastinyan III and you&#39;d be in the clear, but whatever...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s pouting and sulking too, but that&#39;s not important!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Okay, leave it to me! I have no mercy for bandits. Time for some death from above!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We made it somehow. Although it took longer than I&#39;d have liked.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The axe isn&#39;t delivered yet...I guess it&#39;ll barely make it by noon tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, we can still accommodate that.... Umm, it&#39;s about four hours before daybreak.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You may feel uneasy here, but we should all get some sleep if we can.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree. We have the officer&#39;s room that was given to us last time, so please rest there, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I will also get some sleep to prepare for tomorrow. Four hours of sleep is better than none.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go check up on the soldiers then!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We&#39;ll have some touchy-feely lucha libre! After all, we will all fight together tomorrow, yes!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go back and check up on Jaguar. She might get sidetracked, you know.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> My, aren&#39;t you nice to care about my no-good minion, Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Umm, well, half of it is just to kill time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t sleep well anymore. Not since I found out about Ereshkigal borrowing my body at night.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m going to rest too. I&#39;ll see you here in four hours, upon daybreak.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Four more hours...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Then</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good evening.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ana, you&#39;re not gonna rest?</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t sleep, so I am taking a walk. What about you,Fujimaru? Don&#39;t you need to sleep?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll sleep in a little bit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m thinking of staying up till morning.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Hmm...I think I understand.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Wanting to take a walk because there&#39;s nothing else to do...Remembering that we were at Uruk just yesterday...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> For some reason, those kinds of things keep popping up in my head. They have been keeping me awake...It&#39;s pathetic...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is it really, though?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. Because I know I have been fighting as a stoic Heroic Spirit up until now.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> It&#39;s not good to be showing my emotional side all of a sudden. Keeping your composure is very important.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A lot has happened.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. True.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Though I&#39;ve focused mostly on battles, so I didn&#39;t actually join in the fun with everybody.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Still...Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No...Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s what&#39;s so great about you.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> From the time we met in the forest all the way until now, you&#39;ve never asked me anything.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Trusting a suspicious Servant like me without asking anything is strange in itself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Did you enjoy Uruk?</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...No, not really, since I dislike humans.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Humans are smart creatures. You constantly look for other possibilities and “what ifs. ”</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> You will always choose what&#39;s better. That&#39;s why human cities vary from one another.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> However...When something new is created, what happens to the things that are no longer “better”?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> It would&#39;ve been fine if they just became “ordinary. ” Or if humans forgot about them. Or stopped using them.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> But no...Humans try to reject them. They say they&#39;re evil.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> They believe the new will be useless if the old and ordinary remain.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...That old lady was being treated the same way, protecting shriveled flowers inside that dark, dreary house of hers.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...At first, I only helped her because it was a job.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> But she looked so happy, and she told me so many stories.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Even though she couldn&#39;t see anymore, she was at peace. Even though she was lonely, she never spoke of it.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...She treated me like her grandchild. We ate butter cake together.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> She said, “Isn&#39;t it delicious? ” ...Even though she couldn&#39;t taste anything anymore.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was probably really delicious to her.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I think that would make me happy. But...I didn&#39;t get to say goodbye to her...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...? What are you doing, Fujimaru? Why are you going through your bag...What&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Here. This is for you.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> A floral headpiece...For me?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> This is...that flower shop&#39;s...The old lady made it for me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She said it would look great on you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> She said you&#39;ll be a beauty in the future.</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> That is not possible. I do not plan on growing older than I am now.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I dislike humans. But they are very warm.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> The city of Uruk was like a dream for me. I wanted humans to be nice to me. I wanted to be nice to humans.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> That is how I wanted it to be. That is what my old self wanted.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> It&#39;s the dream the adult me...The grown-up me can no longer remember.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Thank you for the gift. But I can&#39;t accept this.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Fujimaru, please hold on to it. I don&#39;t have the right to wear it.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...That old lady&#39;s grandchild was killed by Demonic Beasts at this Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s depart at sunrise and defeat Gorgon. That is why I am here.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Still, this journey changed my reason for fighting. You see, before I was merely fighting for myself...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> But now, I&#39;m fighting for the people of Uruk too. That is the least I could do to pay them back.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well well, isn&#39;t this a coincidence. For us to run into each other in the middle of the night.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh really?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course. Taking a stroll around the wall has its benefits.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s like a good luck ritual to prepare for tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re not going to sleep, Merlin?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hm? You ask if I sleep or not? Oh, right, I never told you all the little Merlin trivia.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, grrr!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Whoa!? Stupid Cath Palug, attacking me again! What did I ever do to you!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fohhh!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> What? Talk about myself a little? Because we&#39;ve all been together for a pretty long time now?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hmmm...I don&#39;t think speaking about who or what I am at this point would be all that interesting...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Well, if Fujimaru can&#39;t sleep, then it could be a good bedtime story.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> How about this? You can ask me one question.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Topics like human growth and guidance are just such a pain to answer, so normally I either stay silent or lie my way out...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But just for tonight, I will answer anything you want to know. Come, ask away.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course, you can just walk away and not ask anything. I would actually prefer that more.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why did you decide to serve King Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, that. Well, because he&#39;s the one who summoned me.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Truth be told, King Gilgamesh and myself are very similar in nature.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> First, neither he nor I have any attachments to humans themselves.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He is an adjudicator that tries to keep humans on a fair scale. That is why he protects mankind, but he doesn&#39;t favor individuals.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> On the other hand, I&#39;m just a spectator. I don&#39;t ever become an ally. Mankind or individuals, it&#39;s all just somebody else&#39;s business.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foooou!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And second. Although we both say that, we both like humans.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You think that&#39;s a contradiction? Well, it&#39;s just a difference in perspective, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh sees value in what humans create.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> “Humans themselves are foolish, but the things humans create have meaning...”</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s probably a belief that lies at his core. On the other hand, I...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m interested in the end of mankind. I continue to survive just so I can witness that.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, it just means we&#39;re both inhuman. That&#39;s part of the reason we&#39;ve decided to work together.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We have our differences in how we enjoy it, but our goals are the same: to continue humanity, and witness its eventual end.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That is the reason I decided to serve King Gilgamesh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you the one who sent out Bedivere?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ah, so you&#39;re going there...That&#39;s a little painful–no...quite painful for me.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I am the one who sent him to the Holy Land. When the Lion King appeared, that&#39;s when he appeared in Avalon.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> In order to solve that twisted fate, there was no other way but to send Bedivere over.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I knew very well that it would be a cruel decision forced upon him.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I am inhuman, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a scumbag. I didn&#39;t want Bedivere to suffer if it could be avoided.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But, you know. If only the Lion King disappeared, or if only Bedivere remained in Avalon,</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> as a fellow member of the Round Table, it would have felt odd. I mean, I was King Arthur&#39;s mentor, after all.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Even though I was aware of Bedivere&#39;s pain, I decided to prioritize correcting Altria&#39;s mistake.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foooou!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ow, ow, ow, stop clawing me, you! Give me a break, it worked out better than expected!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> There was no way to save THAT Bedi and the Lion King together! In the end, I think I did a darn good job!</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Just like Dr. Roman said...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Even putting it mildly, he&#39;s trash...</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, of course. I&#39;m not human like you. I&#39;m a completely different creature who just happens to have a human form.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Humans may call me a sage, but not once have I ever acted in their interests.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m a mix between an incubus and a human. Incubi are spirits that feed on the minds of humans.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Usually, they don&#39;t have an “identity. ” That&#39;s because they copy the personality of the human they&#39;re feeding off of.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Incubi just take human mental activity as a source of energy.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> However, I&#39;m half-human, so I have half an ego...I came to hold a sense of purpose.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I only came to be called a sage because I learned that was how everyone would accept me.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m no more than a monster pretending to be human.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I studied humans and tried experiencing emotions, but I still couldn&#39;t understand them.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course, I have intelligence, so I understand human pain. But I can&#39;t really understand the burden of it.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No matter how far I get, it&#39;s always someone&#39;s dream. I can speak of love and hate, but I cannot truly experience them.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> However, even for someone like me, there&#39;s one thing that will bring me happiness. A unique purpose that only I have, even among other incubi.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And that is...?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> A happy ending for mankind, of course.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> In mankind&#39;s final moments, I want to see the very last human&#39;s dream.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If you humans don&#39;t exist, then neither do I. I am a Phantasmal. We lose meaning without you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Incubi don&#39;t have any direction or preference. Well, maybe we lean towards bad dreams, since they&#39;re higher in nutrition.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But I still have an ego. If I don&#39;t have a meaning–a purpose–I cannot live.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So, I have chosen your ending as my purpose.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Humans are foolish. Not in a philosophical way, but in a biological sense.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> There are no other intelligent species so wasteful in the universe. And at the same time, there are none so unpredictable, either.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> You humans are truly flawed creatures. But...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But the history you create is beautiful.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This much I can say with certainty: no matter what kind of end humanity faces, your history will be worth leaving in this universe.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s about it from me. Romani Archaman&#39;s evaluation of me is correct.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Nothing will stop me from obtaining what I want to see. This time is no different.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> So feel free to use me as you like, child of humanity. As long as it&#39;s for your tale, the one long history that&#39;ll one day be complete,</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m willing to dedicate my body and soul.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s time. We already have troops assembled inside the Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> An hour after we leave here, the troops will be deployed to prepare for the decisive battle on the Demonic Front.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;d give it about a fifty-fifty chance that Gorgon will be lured by our diversion. But the Demonic Beasts will definitely come out of the Cedar Forest.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s how strong their desire for revenge against humans is.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> They won&#39;t be able to suppress their urges if the humans form a line against the wall.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Once we have confirmation of that, we will infiltrate the Cedar Forest from the ruined city of Babylon and head for the Blood Fort.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, Quetzalcoatl will defend the Northern Wall...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> And me of course! ME-ow! Here I am, just in the nick of time!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The infiltration team will be me, Fujimaru, Mash, Ana, and Merlin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Roger that. I&#39;ll redirect three slides of Sheba on Quetzalcoatl, and monitor the situation at the Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> All right. Let&#39;s begin. Fujimaru, give me your orders!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Operation Marduk Blitz, begin!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got enemy signatures already! It looks like a group of rogue Demonic Beasts from Babylon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This will be a skirmish before you enter the Cedar Forest! Let&#39;s do this, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enemy Demonic Beasts annihilated! Good work!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m not picking up any more around the area. Looks like that was all the Demonic Beasts that were nesting in Babylon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No wonder there were so many...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Indeed. The battle was tougher than we imagined. Senpai, are you okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to have to keep fighting without rest. Make sure you don&#39;t run out of magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ishtar, you&#39;re helping quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I know. I was thinking this was where it all started, so that&#39;s why I got all fired up.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Back then, I thought: “What a rude human. How can I torment [♂ him /♀ her]? ”</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Sorry to bother you mid-conversation, Fujimaru, but could you put me through to Dr. Roman?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s been about an hour. How&#39;s the Northern Wall looking?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The battle has just begun.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The first wave of Demonic Beasts has passed through Nippur, and will engage the Northern Wall defense force in five minutes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And leading the charge is a young man with green hair—it&#39;s Kingu, commander of Tiamat&#39;s Eleven Offspring.</p><p><strong>G：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> They&#39;re coming! First line, get ready! It&#39;s time to use what King Leonidas taught you!</p><p><strong>F：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Listen! You should only fight on the front for about half an hour! Our individual power won&#39;t prevail against them!</p><p><strong>F：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> If you get tired, fall back to the fourth line, rest, and get new weapons! Breathe steadily and wait to return to the fight!</p><p><strong>G：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> They&#39;re making contact!</p><p><strong>G：Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> It&#39;s time to show the king just how strong us survivors are! Men, attack!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The Great Animal War begins meow! We should head out too, Kuku!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The people at the Northern Wall accepted me quickly and let me eat good meat! We can&#39;t let these fur-midable warriors die!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I agree, Jaguar. Normally both sides of a fight are at fault, but those Demonic Beasts were twisted by Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> They&#39;ve lost their ability to reproduce in order to up their combat capability. They&#39;re sad creatures that will die out once this is all over.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Are they good, or are they evil? No sé! But I would rather fight for the side that has a future, yes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s go! Time for me to show you the PAWer of the jungle!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...! Jaguar!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Oh? I thought it was a Servant, but it&#39;s just you, Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Haven&#39;t seen you since Mother took the throne. I assume the Three Goddess Alliance fell apart.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes, Ereshkigal and I have withdrawn from Uruk. I&#39;m helping the humans now.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...I see. That&#39;s unfortunate. You were a wise goddess.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Ereshkigal aside, I thought at least you would have understood Mother&#39;s grief.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You, the goddess that had the civilization she nurtured destroyed by the savage conqueror Cortés.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I felt sympathy for you when you said that you would destroy every single human.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I thought that you alone would take on the world, and become an avatar of slaughter.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> So where is that goddess?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Where? I&#39;m. Riiight. Here.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> What...!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Okay, just kidding, yes! That&#39;s enough silly faces, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Prepare yourself, Kingu. I&#39;m going after Gorgon as soon as I take you out.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to keep marching forward, and take the heart of the one who is imitating Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Consider that my thanks to her.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Thanks...? And what thanks would that be?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Thanks for not trying to kill me. Thanks for helping me find a wonderful Master.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes, I will ignore my pledge as a goddess for my Master!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Gorgon&#39;s head will be mine!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You are absurdly strong, Quetzalcoatl. More than that, you&#39;re altogether absurd. I couldn&#39;t be more disappointed.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> We don&#39;t need a stupid goddess in our new world. I will shred you to pieces, along with your precious winged serpents!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl&#39;s keeping Kingu busy for now. As long as she&#39;s still with us, Kingu won&#39;t get close!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> All right, everything&#39;s going according to plan. Quetzalcoatl&#39;s good at getting people worked up.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> That&#39;s an adult goddess for you. She&#39;s flat-out lying and kindling Kingu&#39;s anger.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...? I don&#39;t know what part of that was a lie. Any ideas, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The part where I&#39;m a wonderful Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The part where she wouldn&#39;t make faces anymore?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s the part where she said she would ignore her goddess pledge. Quetzalcoatl is far more powerful than Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Kingu can&#39;t stand idly by if Quetzalcoatl says she&#39;s going to take out Gorgon even if it kills her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now that you mention it, that&#39;s true...It sounded so obvious, so I didn&#39;t notice...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> At any rate, the plan is proceeding nicely. Let&#39;s head to the Cedar Forest! There&#39;s no resting from here! Let&#39;s go, everyone!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait. Stop, Merlin! I&#39;m picking up signs of Divinity from three hundred meters ahead!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s the Blood Fort! Send the signal to Quetzalcoatl!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> All right, leave it to me! Special Britain Spell: Altria, It&#39;s Time for Dinner!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A flare!? Senpai, a flare-like thing just went up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Tell me more about that spell!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> RUUUUUUN!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Dummy, we still haven&#39;t taken cover! That massive thing is going to come down right on top of us!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If we&#39;re not at least three hundred meters away from the impact, we&#39;re going to get blown away too!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, whoops. My hand just slipped. Womp womp?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hey!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I will murder you, Merlin!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...? What&#39;s wrong, everyone? For a second I thought there was lag...You&#39;re all so still. Did something happen?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Merlin...threw his staff...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Merlin might&#39;ve just killed us...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> SUUUIIIIICIIIIIDAAAAA!!!???</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I just heard Quetzalcoatl scream many miles away in Babylon...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yeah...That was...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yeah...It was terrible...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I can&#39;t help it if my hand slipped...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think my staff would become a beacon that would lead the axe there. My bad, my bad.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It looks like the axe didn&#39;t hit us, but instead buried itself right in the Blood Fort...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well then! That worked out perfectly! We can&#39;t let Quetzalcoatl&#39;s noble sacrifice go to waste!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> We have things we need to do! Now it&#39;s time for the final battle!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooo, fofofoooooooooo!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> (...The signal! ) Playtime is over, Kingu!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The Axe of Marduk...! You brought that all the way here from Eridu!?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Still!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Something that large isn&#39;t going to do you any good. You&#39;re supposed to use your trump cards after stopping your opponent, bird brain!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That&#39;s just uncalled for, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I considered pounding your face into the ground to make you think on what you said...but I&#39;ll forgive you this once, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Things have gone exactly according to plan, yes! The axe was just a mere ticket to get through!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m just a courier who delivers things to their destination at the appointed time for—</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> SUUUIIIIICIIIIIDAAAAA!!!???</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh no! Kuku turned into fried chicken! And in Spanish, “suicida” means suicide!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m not fried chicken. I&#39;m a bird of fire! Argh, divine punishment fell from the heavens!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Meow...Kuku had so much Divinity, but now...it&#39;s dropped by over half!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hmmm, you broke the goddesses&#39; pact, but maybe it was okay because you didn&#39;t really mean to?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Merlin, you&#39;ll pay for this!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I am totally, and I mean one hundred percent maximum goddess fury mode, going to punish you with the ultimate lucha!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Gorgon&#39;s Divinity is falling...Did the axe destroy the temple!?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl...! You still dare to back the humans!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes, I wasn&#39;t planning on going this far, but I guess I did in the end!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry, Kingu. This is as far as my help goes.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I won&#39;t lay a finger on Gorgon. Destroying her is a job for the humans.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Dammit, that little goddess isn&#39;t here!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> This is terrible...She&#39;s the one Servant I can&#39;t let go! I have to go save her...Save Gorgon...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Looks like you get to live a bit longer, Quetzalcoatl. I&#39;ll take care of you after I save Gorgon!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Seems the rest is in Fujimaru&#39;s hands, yes.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But that was surprising. Kingu was really concerned about Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I know Kingu is using Gorgon for their own benefit, but maybe they love her in their own way...?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is Gorgon&#39;s temple...The wall&#39;s lined with what looks like cocoons...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s...shadows inside...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> It&#39;s better not to look. You...really don&#39;t want to see...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait...Wait! These...These shadows are...!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re going to kill Gorgon. I&#39;m not one to talk about myself and the other goddesses...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But this is going too far. To desire something more productive than humans to get revenge on them...That defeats the whole point.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s look for Gorgon.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...But...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re alive! They&#39;ve...changed, but they&#39;re all still alive...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Mash, Fujimaru, please hurry.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Kingu has left the front line and is heading towards you at high speed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At this rate, you&#39;ll have to fight both Gorgon and Kingu. And you won&#39;t have a chance then.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take you there. I know where Gorgon is.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, Mash. I know it&#39;s difficult, but I&#39;m going to ask of you anyway.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Now is the time to fight. Please, lend me your power to defeat Gorgon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This is...the deepest part of Blood Fort...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s like we&#39;re in the belly of a beast...</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She&#39;s here. That long tail of hers is wrapped along the cave&#39;s walls.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> O Tiamat, Mother of the Demonic Beasts...No, composite deity Gorgon...!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Your Divinity is all but gone! Give up and show yourself!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Well, if it isn&#39;t the little insects I let go.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> You&#39;re so loud, humans. Do you run amok knowing that this is Tiamat&#39;s bedchamber?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You...you&#39;re the one who did all this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why, Gorgon!? You said you&#39;d take revenge on humanity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That you&#39;d be a goddess for the beasts whose land was stolen, we could at least understand! But...why do something like this?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you want to fight humans, conquer our land, and build a kingdom, we don&#39;t have the right to deny you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But the way you&#39;re twisting and mixing things—That saves nothing!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it that you want revenge on?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Humph. You want reason? There is none to be found here.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Salvation, evening the scales...these are for those who still have something to reclaim.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> For those with nothing left, there is only destruction.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Returning our lands? Restoring our kingdom? What could that matter? There is nothing left for us.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> All we love has slipped through our fingers. All we protected is gone from this land.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Even I have burned to ash and vanished.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> There is nothing left that I want. There is only vengeance. Destruction.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I will kill everything, trample everything, slay the whole world, and die myself.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> That is what it means to be an Avenger. That is what I want.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I will destroy Uruk...I will destroy every single human...For such is the level of hatred you humans had for me.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> It seems that girl doesn&#39;t know how ugly the world is. She must have lived a happy life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s true...I grew up...in a really good environment...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> There&#39;s no sense in talking to a girl like that. But you, Fujimaru. You understand, right?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> You&#39;re a human, and humans created me...Created this Avenger. If you find reason within my words, then nod.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> If you embrace my purpose, then I will keep you as my Master.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Not a bad deal, is it? When this era disappears, the world of man is forever gone.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Or perhaps it already happened?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> You have been the last human for so very long...You&#39;ve no reason to fight for the people of this time.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Hahaha! Call it the whim of a goddess!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> After everything is destroyed, I shall set a single human loose into the barren wastes!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason for your hate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s right, Master! There&#39;s nothing in Gorgon&#39;s words I can agree with!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You were created by humans, and even if you have the right to seek revenge...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I refuse to accept you! That twisted form of yours is a reflection of your own heart!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hah! You can&#39;t even come up with a comeback. She&#39;s got you there, Gorgon!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re just a fake who became a goddess with the Grail&#39;s power. You&#39;ve got no right to call yourself Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> You dare call me a fake Tiamat...? You, a girl who can&#39;t even materialize without a human vessel?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got every right. Even with Potnia Theron, you&#39;re no match to Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> First of all, Mother didn&#39;t need other creatures to create Demonic Beasts, anyway. She could make a world on her own.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She&#39;d never do something as half-assed as use the people she wanted revenge on to get her revenge.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Ishtar&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Gorgon, you&#39;re not Tiamat. You&#39;re just a monster who has lost sight of who she truly is.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Why you...Wh-What is this...Why do I feel so cold...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> My whole body is shaking. I can&#39;t maintain the composite divinity. My mind is going...My reason is coming back...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on, Kingu!? Kingu!? Where are you?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> What is that Servant? I&#39;ve never seen such an ugly Servant!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Take her away! Get her out of my sight!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Someone! Anyone! Kill her! Get that monster out of this temple...!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...I knew it. You can&#39;t see me, can you, Gorgon?</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...If only you&#39;d tried at least a little, there may still have been some chance of saving you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Ana.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Are you okay with this, Medusa?</p><hr><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. I&#39;ve always told myself...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...That I should not live. It&#39;s wrong for me to be here. It&#39;s wrong for me to smile.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...But all of that was wrong.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> I wanted to live. I wanted to be here. I wanted to smile.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> She was the result of that. As was I.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Thank you for helping me see that, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I see. Are you ready, Ana? It will unleash the Divinity you&#39;ve held back this whole time.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Yes, I will allow it, Merlin. I fell for your trick...Now show me the answer!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Mash! Lend me your strength! I&#39;ll use my Mystic Eyes to offset hers!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I do not know...Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t know, don&#39;t know, don&#39;t know! I don&#39;t know you!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Die! Die, monster! Don&#39;t show that ugly face of yours to me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Not yet! It won&#39;t end yet! I won&#39;t let it end yet!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I will have my revenge...All of you who abandoned me, I&#39;ll scatter your blood and remains across the lands!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Gorgon isn&#39;t going down! She lost most of her Divinity, but still...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No way! She&#39;s still immortal!? Her wounds have already healed up!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Of course! You can never defeat me that way! I am Tiamat, the primordial goddess...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I am Tiamat...I am Tiamat...or...I...should be...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I can hear the voice! The voice of a sobbing mother...</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m...I&#39;m taking revenge in her place!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The collapse is continuing! At this rate we&#39;ll all be crushed!</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> No. You&#39;re just a monster, Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> The monster of the Shapeless Isle. Gorgon, the hero-slayer. Your fury will remain on the island.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ana!? No, come back...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Curse you—No! Stay away! Don&#39;t look at me...Don&#39;t...Don&#39;t...</p><p><strong>Ana:</strong><br> ...Yes. Let&#39;s disappear together, Gorgon. That is the reason I was brought to this land.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ana...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Quick! Give me your hand!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The throne has completely collapsed. Gorgon and Ana are gone...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve lost the Spirit Origin reading for both of them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Ana&#39;s weapon is a scythe that causes wounds that never heal. A Noble Phantasm that kills immortals.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Her last strike stripped Gorgon of her immortality.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...This is for Ana.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> A flower offering...It&#39;s sad, but I think she deserves it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...I know it would have looked very good on her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But...How come I&#39;m not getting a reading on the Grail? Gorgon should&#39;ve possessed the Mage King&#39;s Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Hmm. It&#39;s true that Gorgon used the Grail&#39;s power to regain the Divinity she once had.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She had the blessings of the Grail. But she didn&#39;t have the Grail itself.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Which means there&#39;s only one explanation. The Mage King&#39;s Grail is—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Enemy incoming! It&#39;s coming fast! This Spirit Origin pattern is—</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Mother...! Are you all right, Gorg—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...I see. So I didn&#39;t make it in time.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t with her, so the Grail couldn&#39;t protect her.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> If that little goddess isn&#39;t here, does that mean she sacrificed herself to slay her?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Sheesh...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> So even goddesses were just part of the old world, huh? I guess they lacked the beauty to survive in the new world.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh? What do you mean by beauty, Kingu? External beauty, or beauty found within?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...Shut your mouth, Merlin. I am well and truly furious right now.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never felt something so strongly. I&#39;ve exterminated humans, but only as duty required.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> But now, it&#39;s not duty that moves me. This is...I feel such a powerful hatred for you.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I&#39;ve never killed a human out of anger before. This will be a first for me.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...If you want to fight, fine. You really are different from Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Enkidu insisted on being a weapon until the end, never once killing out of any emotion.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> This mother of yours must&#39;ve meant a lot to you, huh?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> . . I am Kingu. It is natural for me to love Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> And she too loved her creator. So this is all out of pity. Sympathy, I think you call it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kingu&#39;s ready to fight! Master, be careful...!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> With Gorgon gone, her children will self-destruct.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> They were created by Gorgon&#39;s powers. The weaker ones won&#39;t be able to maintain their bodies.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The battle is over. The Demonic Front has ended with your victory. But...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You&#39;ll find no joy in victory, virtuous ones who crushed a terrible Avenger.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Are you satisfied, having saved so many of your comrades? Then...you will pay the price for that by dying here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Kingu&#39;s Spirit Origin is changing...!? Enkidu types can do that?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, be careful...! Kingu&#39;s not a Lancer anymore!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The reading—</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> For this one moment, I shall fight as an Avenger. It&#39;s the least I can do for her!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...!? The observation got cut off! Sheba is turning black, and the light is not coming back!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, what&#39;s going on over there!? Gorgon is dead! The threat to that era is no more!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So why does the Seventh Singularity still exist?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...I guess this is it. I got a little too heated. How unacceptable.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> To think things would come to an end a day earlier than expected. She might&#39;ve gone too far, but she did a fine job for us.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> So...I wanted her to live just a bit longer before Mother&#39;s awakening.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sheba 02, 06, 09, all damaged! This shaking isn&#39;t localized!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a space-time quake! We speculate the spatial rifts are occurring all over Mesopotamia!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Merlin!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...I see, we fell for it. It seems you have won the battle of wits.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, you tricky incubus.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You put Mother in a cage of dreams to postpone her awakening.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> But when she fell asleep, she gave me the Grail and made me her first son.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Which meant that I had only one job: find a way for her to awaken.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> It was simple enough. If she wouldn&#39;t wake up while alive, all I had to do was kill her.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Gorgon didn&#39;t have Tiamat&#39;s Authority because she was a copy.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She was synchronized...She shared her senses with the real Tiamat to gain Potnia Theron...!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. And now Gorgon is dead.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Gorgon&#39;s death reverberated back to the synchronized Tiamat, and awakened her from her slumber.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> As a result, you revealed yourself within her dreams, and she crushed you. Brutally.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...Now then, I no longer need the three goddesses to buy us time.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Behold our true mother. Take a good look at the original sin of humanity!</p><p><strong>Researcher A:</strong><br> What is that...The sea is turning black...!? It&#39;s endless! It&#39;s black all the way to the ends of the world!</p><p><strong>Researcher B:</strong><br> Is this the apocalypse the king spoke of? Send a messenger to Uruk, now!</p><p><strong>Researcher B:</strong><br> Tell them the port and sea are covered with black mud! Other changes include...changes include—</p><p><strong>Researcher C:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong!? Rooftop, what did you see? What&#39;s that sound? What&#39;s happe—</p><p><strong>Researcher A:</strong><br> ...What are those things?</p><p><strong>Researcher A:</strong><br> They&#39;re not Demonic Beasts, nor Sumerian monsters.</p><p><strong>Researcher A:</strong><br> Those things don&#39;t even exist in our world!</p><p><strong>Researcher A:</strong><br> They&#39;re eating people...? They&#39;re ignoring the buildings and crops...They&#39;re only after the people?</p><p><strong>Researcher A:</strong><br> ...No, that&#39;s not right...The people are being remade...Haha. What is that? Is that even possible?</p><p><strong>Researcher A:</strong><br> What I&#39;m seeing is...It&#39;s so...I&#39;d rather die, or get eaten!</p><p><strong>Researcher A:</strong><br> Hahahahahahaha! Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Detecting a large number of unknown magical energy signatures in the Persian Gulf! Each one is stronger than an Ugallu&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Their numbers...Their total numbers are...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Over one hundred million, and still growing!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing Chaldea, or humanity, can do to stop something like this...!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s like a flock of passenger pigeons covering the sky. Hmm, ironically, humans drove those to extinction.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. No one can stop her now. Not even the gods or the King of Mages.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> But don&#39;t worry. You will be destroyed, but humanity will live on.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The ones who will soon cover the earth are the next generation: perfect humans that she designed.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The old humanity will disappear here, now. This planet is ours.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> It&#39;s goodbye for real this time. You can meet your end quietly, in a land covered by these new beings.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Laḫmu...The last divinity birthed by Tiamat...You&#39;re really back, aren&#39;t you, Mother? )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kingu has left the cave! But Doctor, Merlin is...!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...I screwed this up. Instead of trying to create some breathing room, I ended up hurrying things along.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Return to Uruk, quickly. It&#39;s awakened, but it hasn&#39;t started moving yet.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...We can&#39;t avoid being wiped out, but there&#39;s still things we can do. Go tell King Gilgamesh this:</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Tell him that one of the Beasts of the Counter Force, one that devours humanity, one that can only be beaten by the seven Grands, has roused from her slumber.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...The Sea of Life. The Primordial Mother. One of the Seven Evils of Humanity, and one of the Beasts of Original Sin...is awake.</p><h2 id="section-16-demise" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-16-demise" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 16: Demise</h2><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A massive amount of magical energy signatures is emerging from the Persian Gulf.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And they are spreading across all of Mesopotamia at incredible speeds.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What about Uruk!? How long will it take them to reach Uruk!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Excuse me for cutting in, Ishtar. I&#39;m Chaldea&#39;s supervisor, Da Vinci.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Romani is going to concentrate on analyzing these life forms, so I&#39;ll be in charge now.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, really? Nice to meet you! But no more pleasantries! Just tell us what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Okay. We&#39;ve observed close to a hundred million of these life forms. Only a fraction of them have emerged from the ground.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A rough search shows us that there are about 100,000 right now. Of those, around 20,000 are heading for Uruk.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ETA is under three hours. At this rate, Uruk will be under attack in less than half a day.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Eridu has already been attacked. Ur has about an hour.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Assuming some of them drop in on Lagash, Girsu, and Umma along the way, I estimate about 10,000 will reach Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> 10,000! 10,000 monsters at Ugallu&#39;s level...Uruk can&#39;t hold up against that in its current state!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Fujimaru, I&#39;ll go on ahead. If I pull out all the stops, I&#39;ll be there with time to spare!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Let&#39;s regroup in Uruk! Have Quetzalcoatl pick you up along the way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar just left for Uruk on her own! I can hear her breaking the sound barrier!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what should we do? Without Merlin, Ana, and Ishtar...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Many people helped us along the way, but now it&#39;s just us...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You guys should head for the Northern Wall. That&#39;s where Quetzalcoatl and Jaguar Warrior are.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Also, right now the Northern Wall is ironically the safest place in Mesopotamia, since it&#39;s furthest from the Persian Gulf.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I bet a lot of people will be gathering there.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Who knows how many people will arrive, but the Northern Wall will remain the most important fortification. We have to protect it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry to the Northern Wall, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right...! Master, I&#39;ll carry you and we&#39;ll return there as fast as we can!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I wonder what happened to Merlin...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Merlin disappeared. I believe his true body was killed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As an incubus, he was one of the few mages who could meddle in the collective unconscious of intelligent beings while they were sleeping.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I bet Merlin used that ability to stay in Tiamat&#39;s slumbering mind for a long time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He was probably keeping her asleep. Only an apparition of him was with you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But now his true body has been killed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He would&#39;ve been more or less invincible in a sleeper&#39;s deep dream, but that ability has one fatal flaw: REM sleep.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If the sleeper&#39;s consciousness becomes partially awake, all of the dream world will turn against the invader.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> When Gorgon died, that consciousness stirred. Half-awake, it was able to capture and obliterate Merlin.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Merlin...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You two are safe! That is fortunate, yes! Where is that incorrigible Merlin!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Merlin is no longer with us. And Ana perished defeating Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar has gone ahead to Uruk. What are you doing here, Quetzalcoatl!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We came to meet up with you, yes! The Demonic Beasts at the Northern Wall are mostly decimated, with survivors fleeing into the forest!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The battle with Gorgon is over. That&#39;s why we came here.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...So Merlin is gone. I want to say something, but I&#39;ll hold my tongue...for now.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We also detected a disturbance from the sea. You won&#39;t make it to Uruk in time on foot.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So hop aboard my serpent. It will be a wild ride, but much faster than traveling on the ground.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Quetzalcoatl!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Oh, you are too kind! Calling me the fairest goddess of them all makes me blush...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t hear anything of the sort, but I see that you weren&#39;t a member of the Three Goddess Alliance for nothing!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> She has some sort of goddess complex! ...Oh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What happened with the Axe of Marduk?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s useless now, forget about it, yes! Forget! When the Blood Fort was destroyed, it lost its Divinity.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And I lost about half of my Divinity, too! And I was ready to tear Merlin a new one for that, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You&#39;re just as guilty, Fujimaru! You were right next to me, but didn&#39;t stop it! So prepare for an earful later!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatlus:</strong><br> Skree! Skreeee!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Oops. We don&#39;t have time for a long chat. Now both of you get on that serpent over there.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> All right, straight onward to Uruk! Hold on tight!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Aieeeeeee...! What is this!? What is thissss!?</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> I thought we were going to be spared! I thought if we submitted to the goddess, we wouldn&#39;t be killed!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Everyone, get outside...! Run! Run awaaaay...!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Escape to Uruk, hurry! There are no more warriors left in Ur! They were all sent to Eridu as sacrifices!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> Hurry! Get away now...Aaaaaaaaaah!</p><p><strong>Ur Civilian:</strong><br> ...Huh? Wh-wh-who are you?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...I have no name. I am a vagabond who has nowhere to go. I just kill and kill and kill the Demonic Beasts of the wasteland.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> You gave a night&#39;s lodging and a meal to a man who had forgotten even human speech...to a madman.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...This is my repayment. You should escape, quickly. These demons are my prey. I will not let anyone else slay a single one.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. I am just an idiot with a one-track mind, waving a lance around.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Dueling to the death with demons from hell is a fitting ending for me!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahahahahaha! But what&#39;s this!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Is this the result of devouring Demonic Beasts 24 hours a day!? New kinds of prey!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Good. I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way! This hell is fitting for a man who has become an animal!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I can no longer live! I was unable to give up worldly desires and attachments, and I was not even able to reach the state of Musashibou!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> There is no meaning in trying to attain a state of perfect spiritual concentration! It did not change this man&#39;s nature at all!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Fwahaha, hahahahaha...! Despicable! You demons are as ugly as me!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Kill this beast of a man if you can! After that, you are free to eat these fleeing people to your heart&#39;s content!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong, you gibbering mob!? Didn&#39;t the mouth of hell open up?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Why don&#39;t you all come at me at once!? Picking you off one at a time is unsatisfying!</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Very courageous, Benkei. That&#39;s a lot of yelling for a coward.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Is your blood flowing fast? Or has your old sense of humor returned?</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Either way, you&#39;re still a noise that should be silenced.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Humph, who the devil are you!? Do not speak to me as if you know me—</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Impossible. Are you...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> You are in the way. Don&#39;t put a damper on our fun.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Fool. Didn&#39;t you say you wanted to die? I shall kill you, just as you wish.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> No! No! ...Arrr Aaaaaaaaaah...!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, we&#39;re over Uruk! The city...Uruk is burning!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What&#39;s with these things!? They&#39;re endless! And they&#39;re diamond-hard! Why are they so sturdy!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What, Fujimaru!? You got here faster than expected.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s all me, yes! I went to pick them up! I&#39;m just a big sis who is cleverer than you by half☆</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Is that so? Well, whatever, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here! There was only so much I could do sniping from the sky!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Land in the city and intercept them! Take out as many as you can! Hurry!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to us!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m leaving the sky to you!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...You look pale, yet you still go in recklessly. You&#39;re a big help, though. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> After you land in the city, secure a path to the ziggurat, so the citizens can flee to safety there.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Also, prepare yourselves. The creatures down below are like nothing you&#39;ve seen before.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Be careful not to lose your nerve before you start fighting.</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Aaah, stay back! Get away! Somebody help! Somebody!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...s@4r;f@eeyw@ruit@s@k94i4b@ewe?</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> Ow! It hurts! Aaaaaah! Stop! Stop it!

I forced myself to stay perfectly still, so why!?</p><p><strong>Uruk Civilian:</strong><br> It&#39;s him! It&#39;s because he ran away!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Don&#39;t run away! Fight! If we don&#39;t stop them here, we won&#39;t stand a chance!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Everyone, attack together! Let&#39;s kill them one by one, together!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> qkde qkde! g@&#39;ffffffffffffffffffffff!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> It&#39;s no good...We&#39;re not even making a dent! Our spears and arrows just bounce off of them! What are these creatures!?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> qkde! Qkde! g@&#39;ffffffffffffffff!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s as far as you go, monster!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Mash...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right...! Commencing combat with these unknown life forms, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemies are multiplying as we fight them! Even one of them is almost too strong! If this keeps up...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> There&#39;s a limit to how many we can handle! They&#39;re just overwhelming...Huh?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...tzs@4d(4l)4.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The enemies are all just walking away...Did they reach their active limit?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It didn&#39;t look that way...But it didn&#39;t look like they had a chain of command either.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s like one of them got bored, and the others saw it and followed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They looked like soldier ants, with no intellect or individuality...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But either way, this gives us a little bit of breathing room. Let&#39;s go to the ziggurat.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Gilgamesh should know what&#39;s going on. Let&#39;s talk to him first.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Move the surviving citizens beyond the Northern Wall! We&#39;ll use Nippur as a temporary refugee base!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Again, there&#39;s no need to recruit soldiers from the refugees. Only those who were born warriors need to stay in Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> At last, the day of destruction is upon us. We have two more days at most.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That fool Merlin hastened the destruction I foresaw for Uruk by a full day!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But there is no need for you to die along with Uruk. If you can make it to Nippur, perhaps you can survive.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Those who wish to live, head towards the Northern Wall. If you wish to fight, then die for Uruk&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You have until evening. Say your farewells to your friends and family.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldiers:</strong><br> ...King Gilgamesh...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So you&#39;re back, Chaldeans? Looks like you succeeded in defeating Gorgon.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmm? You don&#39;t look so good. Are you tired, or have you seen too many things you wish you hadn&#39;t?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Will you rest a little? No one will object to that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please continue, King Gilgamesh.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. Very well then.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ishtar. Quetzalcoatl. And Jaguar Warrior, who I&#39;ve heard so much about! Fwahaha! So, you&#39;re Jaguar Warrior!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know how to handle this sudden pawpularity! I&#39;m having mixed feelings about this warm welcome!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. Don&#39;t say that. It&#39;s been tough here recently. I needed something to laugh at.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Now I&#39;m even more confused! Should my feelings be hurt?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Give me your report, Fujimaru. Tell me everything that happened at the Demonic Front.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. So Merlin&#39;s dead.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Undefeated in real life, he was crushed inside a dream. That&#39;s a fitting ending for him.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “Evils of Humanity”...Is that definitely what Merlin said?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, he said that the Mage King summoned one of the Seven Evils of Humanity to this land.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, King Gilgamesh, what is an Evil of Humanity? And...there are seven of them?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What, you&#39;re not aware of them? I had thought you&#39;d found the answer to that in your journeys.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Seven Evils of Humanity, as the name suggests, are humanity&#39;s stigmas. A series of disasters that destroy humanity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The more humanity develops, the stronger they become, like a cancer eating at society from within.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You could call them stagnant pools within human history.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Do you mean those who seek revenge, like Gorgon? Beings who would destroy humanity through animosity?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The opposite, beautiful one.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Evils of Humanity are not evils that destroy humanity. They are evils that humanity destroys.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Evils that humanity destroys?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Indeed. Humph. I&#39;ll let the appropriate person explain when the time comes.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just know they are disasters that threaten human history. Humanity&#39;s self-destruct system and safeguard...and the basis for Heroic Spirit summoning.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Seven Evils of Humanity manifest and exist as Spirit Origins. They are seven disasters, created by humanity&#39;s bestial nature.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Thus, their class is Beast. This is what the Mage King has awoken. One of them, at any rate.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hold on. The primordial sea could only mean Mother.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Are you saying this abnormality wasn&#39;t caused by the mother of gods...by the goddess Tiamat?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fool. I&#39;m telling you that Tiamat is one of the Beasts. Our foe is quite literally a primordial god.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Beast-class...The Seven Evils of Humanity...So that&#39;s our foe now?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Indeed. It&#39;s a name for all the Beasts of Disaster.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Beast in this land does not seem to have awakened completely. You have no readings on it, right, Chaldeans?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yeah. King Gilgamesh is right. I don&#39;t see a Spirit Origin signature that terrible anywhere.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As for possibilities, you know...I probably shouldn&#39;t have to tell you where it is.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I bet it&#39;s inside that darkened Persian Gulf, yes. We could see it from the sky on our way to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> There were so many strange things coming out of the black sea. What are those, Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I have no idea! Every one we captured just melted away!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Thus, I&#39;ll turn to you instead! How about it, Romani Archaman of Chaldea?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm...Sheesh. I just finished my analysis. Though it&#39;s within the limitations of what I can do from here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re short on time, so I&#39;ll just get to the conclusion. They&#39;re made from what you&#39;d call the base for the Mesopotamian world—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sand and soil of the Age of Gods...The Mud of Gods. These beings don&#39;t exist in our genealogical tree.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Since there&#39;s no difference between males and females, we can assume they reproduce asexually instead of sexually.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> From their internal structure, it seems that they&#39;re currently in a larval state. Meaning they&#39;re going to change even more.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They emit so much magical energy because their Magical Circuits are those of beings from the Age of Gods. Think of them as mass-produced Enkidus.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, I&#39;ve named them Laḫmu. It was the name of Tiamat&#39;s first child, and means “mud. ”</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (...Wait, is he actually good at his job? He even got the name Laḫmu right...!? )</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph. Laḫmu, eh? I was thinking the same thing. We&#39;re on the same page, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (And then there&#39;s this idiot trying to take all the credit! )</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We shall now refer to these creatures from the sea of mud as Laḫmu! Sidu– No, you, captain.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Inform everyone of the name Laḫmu. It will make communication easier later on.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Um, where&#39;s Siduri?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Forget about Siduri. We need to deal with the Laḫmu now.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> They&#39;ve spread across Mesopotamia and attacked many cities. They&#39;re not just slaughtering, but kidnapping too.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Our reports show that those kidnapped by the Laḫmu were taken to Eridu.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Laḫmu have taken advantage of Quetzalcoatl&#39;s absence to make a nest in the jungle.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Veo. I&#39;ll need to file a complaint about them personally. Was Ur taken over as well?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So it seems. I don&#39;t know why, but after attacking Uruk, they left for Eridu.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Demonic Beasts had a tendency to sleep at night. Perhaps they&#39;re the same.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Whatever the reason, that&#39;s their nest. But we can ignore that. Our target is that blackened sea.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If Tiamat awakens, it&#39;s over.... Well, actually, it&#39;s over already, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine. Everyone has accepted that this is the end.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Master of Chaldea.

Go to the observation point near the sea, and investigate—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where did Siduri go?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If you&#39;re worried about Siduri, she attempted to protect the people from the Laḫmu and was captured. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh, why didn&#39;t you tell us!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We understand your position, King Gilgamesh, but if Siduri was taken away, then we need to hurry...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m going after Siduri even if you stop me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh, you jackass! Nitwit!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well said, fools! Then I order you to investigate Eridu!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I cannot leave this place, so have Jaguar Warrior be your messenger!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You have one day! Finish things in a day and return to me here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh...H-huh? King Gilgamesh...!? We...you&#39;re letting us save her?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Don&#39;t be so arrogant, foreigners! I&#39;ve said from the start that your lot were unnecessary!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I never considered you part of Uruk&#39;s forces! If you can&#39;t be used, then it doesn&#39;t matter!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I was planning on sending an investigation team to Eridu anyway, and now you&#39;ve saved me the trouble!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh? If you don&#39;t consider us part of your forces, then what were all those orders you gave us?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph. That&#39;s a different matter. I&#39;m a king. Kings give orders. It&#39;s only natural.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now hurry! I leave it up to you how to handle my kidnapped citizens.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Go to Eridu and find out what the Laḫmu want! It may help us defeat Tiamat somehow.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s going on, Solomon? Mother awakened. So why hasn&#39;t she appeared at the surface?</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> The seal. There&#39;s a seal over her, Kingu. She is bound, bound by that great sea.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> You elevated the stray Gorgon to godhood, and the chain summoning brought Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> And then there was Ereshkigal, summoned by the Sacred Temple of Uruk. You brought them all into a rivalry through an alliance,</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> and at the same time kept the king of Uruk at bay. Splendidly done. You are indeed worthy of praise.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> But it&#39;s not enough. Your job isn&#39;t done, Kingu.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> Humanity is destroyed, but its history remains.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> Break the seal on Tiamat and wipe out all the life forms in Uruk. If that happens, even the Singularity itself will disappear.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> Human history will end there, in that era, even without my intervention.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> At last I have the light bands from all of time and space. All that&#39;s left is for you to drop the crushing blow upon humanity.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Yes. As promised, we will take this era.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Only humanity will be destroyed. Mother will make a new world, and I will take over as the first new human.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> That was the one wish of Tiamat after she was abandoned by humanity.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> ...Wonderful. I hear your conviction, Kingu, and you have the power to make your words reality.</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> I will support you. But...</p><p><strong>H：Solomon:</strong><br> But only if that&#39;s what she really wants.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...If that&#39;s what she really wants? Don&#39;t be stupid. Of course it is.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> That&#39;s why Tiamat created me. That&#39;s why she trusted me and gave me the Grail.</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> Stop it...Stop, please, stop—</p><p><strong>Laḫmu A:</strong><br> zg@kiy: @yq,qkd]! 0o4 0o4 0o4</p><p><strong>Laḫmu B:</strong><br> 3dtofd@/94,rd@~cb@4. fd;. t,nwnge.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu C:</strong><br> Ki—ki, kiki, ki— kikikikikikikiki!</p><p><strong>Woman:</strong><br> It hurts!

They toy with and destroy them, and grin with those teeth...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The noise they make is like human laughter. How crude. Why did Mother create such things...?</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> —Ki—kiki, ki—!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. They&#39;re merely soldiers. I am all the world needs.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need companions, or family.... Not even friends.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> For I am the one true and complete new man.

I can&#39;t hear Mother&#39;s voice.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Before, I was able to hear her sobbing when I closed my eyes, but since the sea turned black, I can&#39;t hear anything...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Then I will have to break the seal, just like Solomon said.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...But...Who on Earth has the ability to bind the Primordial Mother?</p><h2 id="section-17-the-new-humanity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-17-the-new-humanity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 17: The New Humanity</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Nobody&#39;s at the gate.

So much was lost in a single day, yes. But look at that road, Mash.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> All the fires that light the night are strewn together to look like a river. The survivors are forming caravans and heading for the Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And the soldiers are still at the walls, carrying those artillery platforms.

They&#39;ve been ripped apart, but nothing&#39;s missing.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The people of Ur were killed for no reason.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Not from hunger, anger, or over territory.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> They were killed simply because someone wanted to try killing them.

It&#39;s a fraction of their forces, but we&#39;re still hopelessly outgunned!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know how you all feel, but proceed with caution!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But there&#39;s no time to waste! If they&#39;re being gathered up we have to assume the worst!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Calm down. I&#39;m not saying not to fight, Mash. You need to act decisively, understand the situation,</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> and attack from the best possible position.

It ran away without doing anything.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes.

They&#39;re a colony. They might be trading information using their super senses.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ll all be in danger if you can&#39;t stay hidden. Follow it and finish it off.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t. Never mind that Laḫmu. Let&#39;s hurry to the plaza.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar? Um...What is it?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Just do it! We don&#39;t have time to spare, right? Sorry to be so difficult, but we can&#39;t just idly watch anymore!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We&#39;re going into the plaza!

Please!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...This is bad.

I&#39;m the one who&#39;s a threat to you!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> —Gi. Giki, kihahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on? Do the Laḫmu care more about killing their prisoners than their own lives!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s no point, it&#39;s a tangle of contradictions! The Laḫmu are perfected beings as an organism!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There is absolutely no reason for them to fight for survival or attack other living things.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> These little...!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...What are you doing? I&#39;m asking you, what are you doing gathering those old humans!?</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> .........</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now&#39;s our chance! Go, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...! Everyone, this way! Ishtar will support us from above!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Kingu attacked the Laḫmu...?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Seems so. That saved us, too...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But their behavior has obviously changed for the worse...I sense a storm brewing, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Answer me, why do you do such pointless things!? And you call yourselves the children of the Primordial Mother, Tiamat!?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right to attack Uruk. It&#39;s all right to kill the enemy. But why kill without purpose?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Those humans would never become a threat to us. Eventually Tiamat would have killed them herself. They didn&#39;t matter!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I will not allow such pointless behavior from the new humans! Your behavior is completely foolish!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t want to admit it, but Mother must have slipped up after awakening so suddenly.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You are all just defects. Even lower than Gorgon&#39;s Demonic Beasts...!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...Fine. If you understand, then fall back. None of you is a match for Quetzalcoatl.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You may be no better than trash, but you are Mother&#39;s children, my brothers. I can&#39;t stand by and let you die.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Brothers...? You and the Laḫmu?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...That is correct, as much as I hate to admit it. They are just soldiers that were simplified and mass produced based on me.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> And I am the one and only child of Tiamat that was created as a commander. So it&#39;s only natural I&#39;m different from them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Master. This person is, um...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Yeah, dead wrong.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Kingu, you dumbass!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Kingu. You are not one of Tiamat&#39;s children.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tiamat may have created you, but you were not born from her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You said your body was made using Enkidu as a template.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...But that is not the case. Your body is Enkidu&#39;s actual deceased body.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You are probably...a synthetic Demonic Beast made from Enkidu&#39;s corpse.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> What did you say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You are not a “new human”...You were probably created just to awaken Tiamat...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Nonsense. Even if that were true, what&#39;s wrong with that!?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Even if I weren&#39;t born from Mother, she still gave me life. I am her son.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> This body...I don&#39;t know a thing about Enkidu. They&#39;re nothing to me. I don&#39;t even have a record of their past!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> And what&#39;s wrong with that? All I need to exist is my purpose in serving Mother.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Any other notions or extraneous sentiments are useless. I&#39;m just a puppet who works for Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> That is me. Kingu is just a puppet made for that purpose.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> —Shi.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...? What, do you have something to—</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> —ki, shi.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Shishi, shi—</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Shahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I told you all to stop!

I&#39;m detecting the Holy Grail&#39;s signal inside Kingu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So Kingu was the one storing the Holy Grail! Gorgon was receiving the power of the Grail through him!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But why would the Laḫmu steal that!?

Blast that Laḫmu with a plancha at max speed!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatlus:</strong><br> Kweh!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes! We got it! It&#39;s falling down to the shore! Let&#39;s go finish it off!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You go, Quetzalcoatl!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ishtar could learn a thing or two from you!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Now&#39;s not the time to be charming, Fujimaru! I just did what was necessary, yes!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Laḫmu crashed on the beach! Now, just finish it off and take the Grail—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, what is this Spirit Origin reading!? Quetzalcoatl, what&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Not possible!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> This wasn&#39;t how...how it was supposed to be...! Mother created me to be the first of the new human race. . !</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> That was why I destroyed Mesopotamia...That was why I did everything...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Even without any experience, any memory, or any love in this body, I believed Mother had hopes for me...!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Gyaha! Gyahaha! Gyahahahahaha! Over. There! He. Ran. Over. There!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Corner him. Capture him! Break him. Break. The. Defect!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> This can&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> There was nothing, this land had nothing...!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I was expendable from the start...I was just a fake from the beginning...!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> No future, no hopes, no will...not even friends...I had nothing.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> The only thing I had was that I was Tiamat&#39;s only child. And that was the only thing I could cling to...</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Aha. Found. You.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> (So this is where it ends. Just like the old humans...I can&#39;t believe it...)</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> (...I guess I wasn&#39;t anything special...Just like anything else, I can be hurt...broken...)</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> (...Ah, if only I&#39;d known...I wish I&#39;d gone to see him one last time—）</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Huh...? You...saved...me?</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...Run. Now. Enkidu. Although. You. May. Not. Be. Long. Either.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> You&#39;re...the one they brought yesterday...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> But why? Why would you save me...?</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...Find. Happiness. Please. Find. Your. Happiness.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Dearest. Friend. Enki...du.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> We. People of Uruk. Will. Never. Forget. Our gratitude. For. You.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> You. Gave. The. Lone. King. A life. You. Led. Him. To the. Path. Towards. A. Great king.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> There. Was. No. One. Who. Did. Not. Grieve your. Death. No. One. Forgot your. Death.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...I too. I too. Was. So sad.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> That. Is. Why. Find happiness. Enkidu. Beautiful one. Of. Green.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Aah...So glad. Thank. You. I was. Able to. Tell you.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Thank you. Thank. You. Thank. Yo—</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> What is this— I didn&#39;t even know you.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> How come I know your name and face though...You thanking me—</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have any right to receive your gratitu—Urg—</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Urgguuuuugh...! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh...!!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Another Spirit Origin detected. It&#39;s a Servant! But this is—</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> That is correct. You lot stand no chance against me.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> The Wandering Tales of Shana-oh, Act II...Usumidori: Steps of Heaven.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Gah! We were nearly there...! Who are you!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Guardian of Tiamat. Servant, Ushiwakamaru.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It can&#39;t be. Ushiwakamaru...?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The Holy Grail will be delivered to Mother. You humans are not worthy of it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> However, if you want to catch up to it, then I&#39;ll grant your wish. I&#39;ll bring your heads back to the black sea with me. Just your heads.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s not Ushiwakamaru. That&#39;s not Ushiwakamaru, Mash!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Her Spirit Origin signature and appearance may be the same, but everything else is different! It&#39;s the same way the Laḫmu changed!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t hesitate, Mash, Fujimaru! She&#39;s become one of Tiamat&#39;s children!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Exactly. I&#39;ve never felt better, never felt more like myself from before.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> This blade is the voice of love and hate. I shall offer all of you to Mother...!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru has vanished...But now we can follow the Laḫmu...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible. You&#39;re going to die here.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> She&#39;s back!? No, wait. That&#39;s—</p><p><strong>E：Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Die here. Die like the insects you are.</p><p><strong>E：Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Those who survive on the battlefield. Those who forget it. Those who avoid the battlefield. Those who abandoned me there...</p><p><strong>E：Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> All of them must die. I&#39;ll kill them. I&#39;ll kill you. I&#39;ll kill every single human.</p><p><strong>E：Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> And then—Yoritomo, that fool Yoshitsune...I&#39;ll rip the ENTIRE Genji clan apart!!!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Multiple enemy Servants detected...! Doctor, what is this...!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s multiplying. Just like the Lahmu! I...don&#39;t think this new Ushiwakamaru can die!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As long as a finger or single strand of hair survives, a new Ushiwakamaru will grow from it!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is the worst! There&#39;s nothing we can do! Fujimaru, run!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even if you had a Noble Phantasm that could completely obliterate it, that thing won&#39;t stay dead!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Because...Ushiwakamaru&#39;s Spirit Origin signature is mixed in with the sea behind her!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s literally no end to this!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I did tell you...I&#39;m going to kill you.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The only Noble Phantasm that could destroy this sea would be one capable of gathering all the magical energy of the entire era.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In other words, only the light bands covering the heavens can rival Mother now. Do any of you have such a powerful Noble Phantasm?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Heh. Funny you should say that, yes! You know, we just might? But, well, first...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I cannot forgive the way you make Fujimaru and Mash suffer!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Before I bring out the big guns, I&#39;m going smash your face in with my macana, yes!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Shut up, false goddess! I shall smash that pathetic wooden sword of yours to pieces!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Humph...Perhaps you really weren&#39;t all talk.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But you can&#39;t win. While we fought, the Grail was delivered to Mother.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...We couldn&#39;t stop it...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. We failed...We couldn&#39;t get past Ushiwakamaru...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru, how could you...?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Why? I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The old me died in the sea of mud. What you see before you is a dead woman, stripped of her reason and turned into a being of pure instinct.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> The truth is, I always had this in me, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There was a black, inhuman part of me that hated the world of man, and wanted to kill more than anything.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A huge number of Laḫmu has appeared again...! So...so many! Uruk isn&#39;t in any state to handle this many!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...So it&#39;s begun, huh? I must go, then. I don&#39;t want to run out of things to kill.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Now, should I destroy Uruk while its people try to fortify its little walls, or play with the refugees trying to escape beyond the Northern Wall?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Either way, I&#39;m abandoning this body. I have no interest in clinging to something so wounded.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Farewell, survivors of Chaldea. I commend your efforts in slaying me...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Hollow victory though it is. Death no longer holds meaning for me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s head back to Uruk, Master! Even if we don&#39;t make it in time, we can&#39;t just stay here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No, let&#39;s head to the observation point first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, first you need to calm down.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you&#39;re right, but...! Holding my hand like that is helping...!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s a good idea. I agree with Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...And I&#39;m sorry. I failed to stop the Laḫmu from escaping.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not your fault. Nobody could&#39;ve predicted something like that would happen.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> More importantly, we need to do what Fujimaru said, and head for the observation point!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s an emergency, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can run around blindly! First we need to know what&#39;s going on!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And we need to rest, if even only for a few minutes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ve been fighting this whole time. I want to at least get these two some rest in a room with a roof.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes, of course! Good idea, Doctor, yes! First, let&#39;s eat! Eat!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Like the great lucha announcers say, you can&#39;t get in the ring on an empty stomach, yes!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;re late, Chaldeans! What happened? Tell me everything!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> K-King Gilgamesh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-what is this? Is he ripping off the Doctor?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m not ripping anyone off. I was inspired! Why do you think I went to the observation post last time?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I made a communication system for this very moment!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I can see through you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmm. So it&#39;s not quite perfect, huh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I thought it would be boring to copy Chaldea, so I attempted to make a more refined communications system. And it seems I didn&#39;t quite succeed. It&#39;s infuriating!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But it is very good for something done in a rush, right? You have my permission to praise my prowess as a mage!</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Wow, what is this!? I can see them, meow! Hey, Kuku, I&#39;m right here!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on over there? Everything&#39;s in chaos here!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Those Laḫmu attacked again! But this time, amazingly, we&#39;re kinda holding them off!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> His Majesty rolled out those big bows on the castle walls! Three hundred and sixty of them!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Obviously. I prepared enough to repel an attack from any direction. They can hold off the Lahmus for an hour or so.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But! The soldiers won&#39;t last any longer than that! Nor will my magical energy!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s all I have to report! Now, what about you fools?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Explain as briefly as possible. )</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tiamat&#39;s got the Grail. We&#39;re boned.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What were you people doing!? What happened at Eridu?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hey! Calm down, Gilgamesh! Listen, Kingu&#39;s heart was the Grail!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Tiamat was using the Grail as a power source to control what was left of Enkidu!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Then a Laḫmu took the Grail, and threw it into the center of the Persian Gulf, which is where we are now!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s all my fault! Quetzalcoatl did it! Does that settle it? I think that settles it, right? Great! Then we&#39;re done talking about it forever!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So do you have a plan!? I&#39;m open to ideas right now! Even yours!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. That was...succinct, Quetzalcoatl. Now let me tell you what I think!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> First! We got the results from the water analysis.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The black seawater is Tiamat&#39;s Authority itself!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It infects those who touch it, and Tiamat&#39;s Authority is copied into their cells and makes them into her slaves.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Laḫmu were born from the mud of Tiamat. They probably aren&#39;t affected by it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But anyone else, Servant or human, that touches that black mud will be absorbed by Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I see! So don&#39;t touch it! And if you have to touch it, touch as little as possible to protect yourself, meow!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s right...Mother...I mean Tiamat&#39;s Authority includes self-modification, multiplication, and bio-fusion.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But her most powerful one is the “Amino Geas,” or cell compulsion.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Once they&#39;re inside that mud, it will Darken any Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar! You&#39;re here!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late. But I got Eridu back on its feet.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The people are evacuated to the basement of Eridu&#39;s ziggurat, instead of heading to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> They can hole up in there for a day. Even Laḫmu can&#39;t break in there easily.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> A Darkening mud, you say? I&#39;ve never seen it, but what an annoying concept to deal with.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Whatever. Second! The observation post not only recorded the water quality, but also the height of the water and waves!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> They observed an unusual water level. The moment the Grail was stolen from you, the water started to rise by the minute!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> By my calculations, the observation post will be swallowed in three hours, and the black sea will overflow onto land.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What we&#39;re going to see is something even worse than the great flood that once destroyed Mesopotamia.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be a black sea of mud that turns all life it touches into monsters!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If that happens, Uruk, and all of human history, are finished!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If Mesopotamia, the great civilization and basis for urban society, is turned into a world of monsters, the Foundation of Humanity will collapse!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We won&#39;t let that happen! Doctor, give us a plan!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Do you have one!? You have one, right!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I do. I do, but...This is...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t matter. Tell me! At the very least, I&#39;ll listen!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, fine! I&#39;ll tell you! I just observed a Spirit Origin signature at the center of the Persian Gulf!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a Holy Grail, with an ultra-ultra-ultra-class Magical Reactor Core with more than seven times the magical energy of a Grail...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There&#39;s no doubt that this is the primordial Demonic Beast who birthed the world of Mesopotamia! The Spirit Origin belongs to Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If this calamity, this sea, is Tiamat&#39;s Authority, our only solution is to defeat Tiamat herself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Whoaaa...I figured this atmospheric shaking was the aftereffect of Mother coming to the surface...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...It may be that slaying Tiamat and destroying her Spirit Origin would stop the mud. But is that possible?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> She&#39;s on a completely different level than the Demon Gods you&#39;ve fought before. Are you willing to do it anyway, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m ready!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Everyone, let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well said. I will work with that plan, then.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I can&#39;t send you reinforcements, but don&#39;t worry about Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Bring me Tiamat&#39;s head!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That means my winged serpents will be our mounts.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If only we had a flying golden ship, that would sure be nice...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So we&#39;ll approach with the serpents.... Um, I think Senpai should command from here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s risk that the water could touch you during combat. And if you were to fall into the sea...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Impossible. How can Servants win without a Master?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The further a Servant is from their Master, the less efficient the magical energy transfer. And you&#39;ll need the Command Spells, too.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Mash, the time to prioritize your Master&#39;s safety over all else is long past. Right, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> (Nod in silence. )</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. Master Fujimaru. I&#39;m sending you out, knowing the danger.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> (Look at the king in surprise. )</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Way too late! You are not allowed to get cold feet now!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Then it&#39;s decided. Fujimaru is coming even if we have to chain them to a flying serpent.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The problem is what to do when the Laḫmu attack en route. I&#39;ll be okay, but what about the others?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ll have to use the combat tactic Jaguar Warrior suggested. Put up a barrier of magical energy on your feet and fight atop the water.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> An experienced Servant can do that easily. What about you, Mash? Have you ever done that?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t, but I&#39;ll do my best! If there&#39;s any trick to it, please let me know!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahaha! There&#39;s no time, fool. But it&#39;s the king&#39;s duty to aid such courage in a time of need!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I thought this might happen, so I hid a water-repelling talisman in that observation post.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I call it a water strider. If it&#39;s just you, it should keep the water away so you won&#39;t fall in.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re pretty handy, aren&#39;t you!? Are you sure you&#39;re not better suited as a mage than you are a warrior?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh. I&#39;m ready for any situation. Well, maybe not Lancers.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Go then, Fujimaru of Chaldea, Mash, and the survivors of the Three Stooge Goddess Alliance!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Your enemy is the primordial creature called Tiamat...The one who births the Laḫmu, the very source of Demonic Beasts!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> More and more Laḫmu are surfacing! We need to stop this unending Demonic Beast factory, fast!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> They&#39;re not responding to us...They must have dull senses right when they come out of the water.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> They&#39;re only capable of carrying out simple orders, like “go to the surface,” or “kill the old humans. ”</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But that&#39;s just for now. As time passes, their consciousness will synchronize with the others and they&#39;ll be like the ones we saw at Eridu.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Sheesh...They finally grow up and gain individuality, but then they go back to a colony. All our efforts were for nothing.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Those things aren&#39;t the new humanity. They&#39;re just soulless tools. In the name of the goddess, me, I will destroy them all, yes!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Everyone, they&#39;re here! Multiple enemies! Laḫmu and Demonic Beasts!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost offshore! Take them out quickly!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Abnormal Spirit Origin confirmed! It&#39;s here! Two hundred meters from contact!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You should be able to see it! The source of this abnormality is at the ocean&#39;s surface!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Ahhhh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This voice...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...A song?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enemy confirmed on ocean surface! But that—Is that really...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s Tiamat...? Really?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So beautiful...and melancholy...She doesn&#39;t seem anything like the Mother of Demonic Beasts...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Y-yes...I&#39;ve never seen her before myself, but...Those big horns symbolize land, and her eyes reflect the stars of the inner sea...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That is the Goddess of Creation, Tiamat. No doubt about it.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Her womb was the soil of life itself, then it was cast away after fulfilling its purpose of creation.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> In myths, they say she was killed by the gods, but in reality things were slightly different.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She was abandoned. She was abandoned by the entire world, by all the children she brought forth.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> After the planet&#39;s environment settled and life was established, she was deemed unnecessary and exiled.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She wasn&#39;t sent to the old world that lies underneath, but to the Reverse Side. The lifeless World of the Void.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Right. For the primates who gained the phylogenetic tree, she was too dangerous because she had the potential to create another world entirely.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The fear was the foundation built with great pains would get mixed with the next world&#39;s foundation.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So they sealed her off. Infinitely. And now, she has returned.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Whether the Mage King pulled her out of the World of the Void, or if it was humanity itself that called her forth...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> In either case, she should no longer belong on this planet.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We need her to enter a deep slumber once more. We need her to, but...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But it looks like a seal&#39;s been placed on her. Her limbs are bound together.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> She just woke up...No, that&#39;s not it. Is this why the Laḫmu brought her the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s noticed us, so maybe we can just take her down while she&#39;s bound?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I have visual confirmation of Tiamat here, too! This is your chance. Her limbs are still immobile!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s completely sealed! Only her torso and head are free!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now&#39;s the only time to defeat her!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...We can&#39;t hesitate. Uruk is in danger!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Enemy target, Tiamat! Commencing the final battle of this Singu–uuuah!?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Ahhhh.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Ahhhh, Aaaaaa, aaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh...!! My body...I can&#39;t move!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The magical energy within Tiamat is surging! No, something&#39;s happening!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s putting out as much energy as a hydrogen bomb! If she fires, Uruk will get blasted even from that distance!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Don&#39;t let her shoot, Fujimaru! Defeat her before she makes her move!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Ahhhh, Aaaaaa, aaaaaaa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no time. Commencing attack!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We have to do this...!</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Amazing, you did it...! Confirming collapse of Tiamat&#39;s Spirit Origin!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Magical Reactor has also stopped! Your attacks defeated Tiamat, mud and all!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now just wait for the ocean to return to normal, retrieve the Grail, and mission accomplished!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We did it, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Senpai. I had this feeling during the battle with Tiamat,</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> but perhaps those restraints that tied her down...I think she made them herself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Tiamat was binding herself...?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t be positive about this, but that&#39;s the only logical explanation. I mean, Tiamat was, well...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She was voluntarily taking our attacks. As if she was giving us her life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We simply couldn&#39;t comprehend her intent...It seems Tiamat was awakened by the power of the Holy Grail...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But perhaps if the Laḫmu hadn&#39;t delivered the Holy Grail, she would have stayed in the ocean forever?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Mash, even if that&#39;s true, it wouldn&#39;t change anything, no. Tiamat&#39;s mere existence is a threat to humanity.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Whether she was dragged up by the Mage King, or lured out, we had to defeat her the moment she came to this worl—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Earthquake...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Doctor, what&#39;s going on!?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Confirming reconstruction of Spirit Origin. No, transformation into a mega-structure post-dispersion, increasing scale...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Impossible. Can there be such a creature? This is no longer a living being. This, this is—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Water levels of the Persian Gulf are rising again! First wave reaching the coast in 5, 4, 3—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Observation post submerged! The tidal wave was directed, and it&#39;s heading farther onto land!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This is deliberate! It&#39;s planning to head straight to Uruk and swallow it all up!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wait, seriously!? Can&#39;t we stop it!? Didn&#39;t we defeat Tiamat!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, but we just made a huge mistake! What we defeated was just its brain!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Everyone, leave that airspace immediately! The real thing is surfacing from below...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaaahhh, aaaaaaa...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Truly a monster.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A mobile creature factory. She has enough magical energy to travel between stars. She has ample life origins stored within her body...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Humanity needs a few more centuries to reach this divine ark...This is...this is the Tiamat&#39;s true form!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She&#39;s not even looking at us...She&#39;s glaring straight ahead towards Uruk...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Looks like we&#39;re being spared for now, but what should we do!? Quetzalcoatl, what do you think?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We absoooollllllutely can&#39;t win! Nope!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I mean, the difference in size is mind-blowing, no!? I can&#39;t use a joint lock on her, the most powerful move in lucha!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course not.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Si! Nice response, Fujimaru! A sense of humor is important!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl, can&#39;t you grow bigger?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible, no! Conservation of mass works for gods as well! It&#39;s a laaaaaw!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That kind of Authority only existed in the era of Genesis! Not even aliens can take that thing down now!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl. Are you saying you can&#39;t defeat Tiamat even with your real Noble Phantasm...Even with your full-powered Authority?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...No. It&#39;d be cruel to get your hopes up, so I will be blunt.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Even with Ishtar&#39;s Authority, or with any other power currently left in Mesopotamia—</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We can&#39;t so much as scratch Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I see. Thanks. I get the situation now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, retreat! Return to Uruk immediately, and rejoin King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now that the situation is so far beyond us, we need to consolidate our forces!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Roger that, Doctor!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good answer. You haven&#39;t been disheartened yet! Then surely we still have some options left!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa, Tiamat is advancing...!? She can move with all that weight, in that giant body!?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaaahhh. Aaaaaaaaaa!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Second wave incoming...! Oh no, its momentum will carry it straight to Uruk!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Echo confirmed from observation post three!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> The black mud swallowed Girsu City, and is flowing towards Umma and Uruk!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t a wave. They&#39;re like flames flaring up!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> The walls of Umma City can&#39;t withstand it! Estimated time of arrival—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care! Raise the anchors! Deploy the Fangs of Napishtim!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yessir! Send signals by reflections! Deploy the Fangs!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Fangs of Napishtim successfully deployed! It managed to divert the black mud!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> However, it&#39;s badly damaged after firing! It doesn&#39;t look like it can block the next wave...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Figures, but we have no choice! Start the repair work at once!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No need to return it to perfect shape. Maintain its framework if nothing else! That will stop it for a while!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, my king!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...The time has finally come. I have been awaiting this moment with bitter anticipation for six months.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Tiamat, the Mother of All Beasts. What&#39;s beyond this mythical battle is something even I cannot foresee.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Will you swallow the world, or will humanity be worthy of flourishing...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s time to see that question answered. Let the final battle of the Age of Gods begin!</p><h2 id="section-19-star-of-the-beginning-we-look-up-at-the-sky" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-19-star-of-the-beginning-we-look-up-at-the-sky" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 19: Star of the Beginning, We Look Up at the Sky</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So you&#39;re back, Fujimaru. Then let&#39;s begin the briefing. First, the soldiers&#39; report.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, my king!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Currently, there are 306 citizens left in Uruk. Of those, 212 are soldiers, and the rest are civilians.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Initially, the citizens refused to evacuate, but after the king spoke to them, they agreed to evacuate to the Northern Wall.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Of the citizens who already escaped to the Northern Wall, there are 157 survivors. After this afternoon&#39;s Laḫmu attack, there are now 38 surviving soldiers.</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> All together, there are five hundred humans left alive in Sumer.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh? Five hundred...That&#39;s all...?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. That report must be mistaken, right...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No. It&#39;s correct. Between the two Laḫmu attacks and the sea encroachment, the first dynasty of Uruk has fallen.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even if we make it through this predicament, the kingdom cannot be maintained. It would only go into decline.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Do not despair. Even if we perish, as long as Sumerian culture survives, there will be others who will follow in our footsteps.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As for the Laḫmu, they have split into two groups. One group stops on the spot and turns into a sphere as soon as the sun sets.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The other flies back to Tiamat, and guards her surroundings.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So, Romani Archaman. You&#39;ve had almost half a day. I presume you are finished with your analysis of Tiamat?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course. Tiamat&#39;s specs and abilities are exactly as stated in the report I submitted to you.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you should also take a look at it later.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The material data on the terminal over there has been updated.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. This is good work. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hummm...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Curse it! Are you on Tiamat&#39;s side or something!? There is nothing in here about her weaknesses!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Believe me, I wanted to write at least one possible method of attack! But the report is accurate!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s just perfect, with no physical or mythical shortcomings! We&#39;re no match for her!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hmmm...When you say that with tears in your eyes, I suppose I can&#39;t be too hard on you. Good work. You can return to your post.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But we can&#39;t lose control of our emotions here. Well, Jaguar Warrior? What&#39;s your take on Tiamat?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> She was huge. Gigantic. And paws-itively awesome!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Nonsense! I am not asking for your idiotic human impressions of her! Use your animal instincts to tell me something useful!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh, you mean that!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> At her speed, she&#39;ll reach the coast in half a day. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;ll take her about a day to get from there to Uruk!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Tch, that is fast. All we can do is intercept her.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is Tiamat heading straight for Uruk?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why is she targeting Uruk?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Because this city and Gilgamesh are the symbols of Sumerian civilization.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Tiamat sees things differently than you or I, yes. To her, humans and the land are all a single life-form.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Tiamat is after Uruk, the heart of this land, driven by her primordial instincts.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...So that&#39;s why she&#39;s ignoring my temple. Even if Mt. Ebih disappears, civilization will carry on.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But if Uruk and this golden dummy are annihilated here, Mesopotamian civilization itself will vanish.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. If you wish to protect human history, you have to stop Tiamat at all costs.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...But. No attacks work on Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I tried to create an opportunity, but I didn&#39;t think she would be quite so enormous.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We can neither stop her nor drive her back. Why is Tiamat invincible, anyway?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, on that point, I do have a theory...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Tiamat...Actually, I believe all of the Beasts have individual differences.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of all of them, Tiamat&#39;s inborn nature is to never experience death. No matter what she does, death will never find her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru destroying Tiamat&#39;s brain out at sea more or less proved the theory.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So she regenerated after she died. Isn&#39;t that just resurrection?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s different. It&#39;s more retrogression than regeneration.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know this sounds absurd, but stay with me: Tiamat is the mother of all life in existence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The very fact that we&#39;re alive proves her existence. That&#39;s why there&#39;s no way to destroy her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s paradoxical, but as long as life continues to exist on land, Tiamat, Beast II, will never die.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She is the beginning and the end.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The only way she could be affected by the normal laws of physics, and be harmed, is as the last thing on the world to die.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but we definitely can&#39;t beat her! I mean, there&#39;s no point!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To defeat Tiamat, first the human race would need to...All life on Earth would have to die out!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. That&#39;s why I had no choice but to report that she&#39;s invincible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> As long as there&#39;s life...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Stop it. No more brain-teasers. I&#39;m bad at them. Somebody, do something.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...So then, what about the opposite?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Exactly. Brazen of you to think as I do.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ereshkigal! Ereshkigal! Ereshkigal, are you there!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Shush. Be more respectful when you&#39;re trying to call a goddess!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been busy taking care of souls since yesterday! I would even take a dead man&#39;s help at this point!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> First of all, I didn&#39;t lend you the Mirror of Kur so you and I could chat. It was just an apology for everything I&#39;ve done...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Hi.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hello.</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...O-oh! It&#39;s...Give me a moment.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Ahem.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Ereshkigal, Goddess of the Underworld, is here in all of her splendor. Do you have business with me, king of Uruk?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ereshkigal, you&#39;re being so formal all of a sudden!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ah. You&#39;re much prettier than the celestial goddess. It looks like some soul-searching in the Underworld has made you more ladylike.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Why are you looking at me, Goldie? And stop smiling at her, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re embarrassing me two times over.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The fact of the matter is, I called you here to ask a favor.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Currently, Tiamat is heading for Uruk. She will arrive in two days.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t defeat her, Mesopotamia will fall. However, Tiamat will not die as long as there is life on Earth.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Therefore, Mistress of the Underworld, I want you to attend to Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If death cannot touch her in a world full of life, then send her down to a world devoid of life.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In the Underworld, wouldn&#39;t she be the last living thing?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman &amp; Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> !</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Huh? What are you talking about? Summon Mother to my Underworld?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Wait, did you say “send”? You seriously said “send her down! ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course! Ereshkigal, Goddess of Kur! In the name of the king, I command you!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Open the gate of the Underworld across all of Uruk and bind the Beast of Disaster that calls itself Tiamat down in the bowels of the earth!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That is your role after wreaking havoc with the Three Goddess Alliance! Consider that to be your atonement!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Humph. What&#39;s impossible is impossible, and THAT&#39;S impossible! Are you telling me to bring the Underworld directly beneath Uruk!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> How do you expect me to do something so ridiculous!? Ugh! I guess I have no choice!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then you&#39;ll do it!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Uh...W-well, yes. After all, if I don&#39;t, Mesopotamia will be wiped out, right?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been listening all this time. Ever since you returned to the surface. All the time, actually.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> So I know what King Gilgamesh is talking about. To be honest, I was even a little impressed.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I knew it! I knew the Underworld was the way to go. Ishtar, you should do some soul-searching so you can be less useless!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> But! Being convinced and doing it are two different things, Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Do you really think covering the entirety of Uruk with a hole of death is a simple task, even for me!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Just doing it in my jurisdiction of Kutha City was a major undertaking. As big as Uruk is, it will probably take me at least ten years.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Wha...!? Ten years...! ...We don&#39;t have that kind of time...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Well, actually, um, since I hate Uruk, I miiiight have been plotting something the whole time, so give me three days and it&#39;ll be ready!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice one, Ereshkigal!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Y-you think so? Then it was worth cursing every night!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You and Ishtar...are two of a kind...!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, stop...Now you&#39;re embarrassing me three times over...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahahahaa! Brilliant, Ereshkigal! But you and I need to chat a little more later!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If we can manage to drop Tiamat into the Underworld, then defeating her may not be impossible.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But what are we going to do about the time issue?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Tiamat will arrive here in Uruk in two days. Ereshkigal needs three days to prepare the gate to the underworld.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If we defeat Tiamat after Uruk falls, we won&#39;t be able to repair the collapse of the Foundation of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> You people will have to deal with that. My hands are full preparing the gate.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Two days...Or even one day. We need to hold Tiamat off at least that long...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But how...? The Axe of Marduk is broken...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fear not. I already see a strategy for victory. Here is a chance for Ishtar to actually be useful!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...? Why me?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh...! I see. With Ishtar, certainly!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right, yes! It&#39;ll be a cinch with Ishtar, yes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> So that&#39;s how we&#39;ll do it! You&#39;re amazing, Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! It&#39;s just like Merlin said!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s our Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Humph. It&#39;s not that Ishtar herself is all that.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> An spoiled her rotten. I&#39;m so much more amazing because I can set up an underworld gate.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> G-good question. Why is everyone except for Fujimaru so excited!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hahaha, you are just playing dumb. What a nice way of showing us the ace up your sleeve.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But enough of that. Come now. Call on Gugalanna.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Geh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven, who serves Ishtar! It&#39;s said to be as big as a mountain and Sumer&#39;s greatest Holy Beast!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I bet Gugalanna can stop Tiamat in her tracks!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ah, yes. Of course. That&#39;s right. With my Gugalanna, yes. In its heyday, Gugalanna could even make the Tigris River run dry.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I heard about that from the people of Ur, yes! They all say Ishtar&#39;s servant Gugalanna is a Holy Beast to be feared!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> They praised you too, Ishtar, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> A Holy Beast that none of the other gods could tame, but I hear that you managed to bring it to heel first by being strict, then by being more strict!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Y-yes, that&#39;s right. Gugalanna is like my...um...vehicle.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But everyone, I think you&#39;re making too big of a deal out of it. Gugalanna isn&#39;t really that great.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It wouldn&#39;t be of any use against Tiamat...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Gugaaalaaannaaa! Gugaaalaaannaaa!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ishtaaar! Ishtaaar!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Gulp)</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s the matter? You don&#39;t look well.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Normally we&#39;d all have to listen to your irritating high-pitched laughter while you brag about how great he is, even though it&#39;s not even yours originally.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No...Don&#39;t tell me—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...No. I don&#39;t have Gugalanna.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What did you just say!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have it! I lost it! I lost it somewhere!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I think it was in the north, but I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I even searched all through Babylon, but I just can&#39;t find hide nor hair of Gugalanna!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> (Speechless)</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Y-you stupid, useless, bratty goddess! Why did we even bother recruiting you!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...(Made to stand holding a clay tablet that reads, “Worst goddess. ”)</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well this is just perfect, and right when we were one step away from having a workable plan...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now we&#39;re up against a wall...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> All of us at Chaldea want to agree on the strategy of luring Tiamat to Uruk and then sending her to the Underworld.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But there just isn&#39;t enough time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...You COULD go up against Tiamat and just accept that you&#39;d die or get swallowed up by the mud, but then we&#39;d be even worse off...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...(Made to stand holding a clay tablet that reads, “Worst goddess. ”)</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Fine. Adjourned. This war council is taking a break.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Whining will do us no good. We have no plan, but hastiness is also the height of folly.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And Fujimaru is exhausted. Let us rest our weary bones here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Are you giving us a day off?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There isn&#39;t much time until dawn.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This will be our last chance to relax in Uruk. Everyone, replenish your energy.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But don&#39;t stop thinking. We are not going to sleep and just give up.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to get through tonight so we can survive tomorrow.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hey, I dropped in to say hi, Fujimaru! So this is the famous Chaldea Embassy! I&#39;m a bit surprised, yes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Yup yup. I was imagining someplace more like a paw-lace. But I like it! It seems homey!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> By the way, when&#39;s dinner?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;m expecting something like a warm Chaldean family meal.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If you&#39;re hungry, Jaguar, I&#39;ll happily make you something, yes! How about rocks, topped with salt?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s just rock salt! Dammit! So I&#39;ve gotta cook my own meat, then?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And Jaguar goes off to the kitchen...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Now for some peace and quiet. Sorry for the commotion.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What brings you here, Quetzalcoatl?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> What else? It was your scent, of course, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Well, to tell you the truth I had nowhere else to go. Most everyone is dead.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And to the surviving Uruks, Jaguar and I were enemy goddesses, no?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to make them uneasy on their last night. So let me stay here, okay?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I forgot. At Eridu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl, did you know about Tiamat?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Oh, you mean the cylinder seal I showed you at Eridu? Yes, I knew about Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> And that Gorgon had synchronized with her consciousness, and had convinced herself she was Tiamat&#39;s second coming.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But I was a bad goddess. So I couldn&#39;t tell you or Gorgon the truth, no.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I wanted to be Gorgon&#39;s friend, though.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That cylinder was the most I could tell you. It was my way of saying, “Be careful, there&#39;s more to come. ”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why didn&#39;t you just tell us?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You didn&#39;t tell us for Gorgon&#39;s sake?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Well...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Yes. For that one time, I was on Gorgon&#39;s side, not humanity&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I wanted you - no, all of humanity - to truly hate her. I wanted you all to go up against her with everything you had.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If you&#39;d known Gorgon was a fake, and the true threat lay behind her, you would have pitied her and taken her lightly.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want that to happen. That&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t just come out and tell you.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Well, you found me out anyway, huh Fujimaru? Pathetic, no?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s not pathetic.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...You think so? Yeah, I hope not.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I may not look like it, but I am Mesoamerica&#39;s principal deity! I need to look good for my new contractor.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thanks. For Gorgon&#39;s sake, too.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...(Sniff)</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...No, thank you. For staying with her until the end.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> —Never mind! Can&#39;t get all mushy, no!</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Food&#39;s ready! Lamb with rock salt, cooked jaguar style!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> So what are we talking about? Let me join in! Are we figuring out how to run away tomorrow?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes, we were saying that if we sacrificed a goddess, we might be able to stop Tiamat♡</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Here, have my meat. We can&#39;t get you nice and plump if you&#39;re hungry!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Seriously? It&#39;s been six centuries since Kuku&#39;s been nice to me! Wait. Didn&#39;t I get killed around then?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Well, whatever! I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine! If my life can save you, that&#39;s fine with me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You really like Quetzalcoatl, huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is this what Stockholm syndrome looks like?</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Huh? No way! Kuku and I are rivals! Our lives are of equal worth!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> If I die and Kuku survives, that&#39;s okay. If Kuku dies and I survive, that&#39;s purr-fectly fine.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s our relationship. Since we can&#39;t be together, we keep things balanced that way.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If the good god is strong, people turn good. When an evil god is strong, they turn evil.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We can never both be successful, no. So it&#39;s rare for us to be in a situation like this.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s strange that Jaguar and I both want the same thing. This never happened in the myths.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s not the same. I only thought of defeating Kuku.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But Kuku&#39;s different. This time around, everything she&#39;s been doing is to save humans.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> To save humans...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So why did you join the Three Goddess Alliance?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I already told you. I enjoy fighting, so I joined the Alliance so I could kill huma—</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s a lie! Kuku joined so she could stop the other goddesses!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I mean, those goddesses weren&#39;t the sort to stop after just a firm talking-to!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> The plan was to get the Uruk Grail first, so she could stop them from exterminating all humanity!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooooou! Lucha, foou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Coatl was a good big sister.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That&#39;s not fair. I wasn&#39;t able to be a good big sister...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> B-but I did do my best, yes! If I get another chance, I want to try to get along with Gorgon better!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar? Were you resting?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes, I was enjoying the night breeze while I watched what&#39;s become of Uruk. What about you, Mash? Why aren&#39;t you with Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai is at the embassy. [♂ He /♀ She] wants to clean [♂ his /♀ her] room one last time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Haha, what? That&#39;s silly. That&#39;s so like [♂ him /♀ her].</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> By this time tomorrow, either Uruk will be gone, or you&#39;ll have beaten Tiamat and be heading back to your own era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s...No, I can&#39;t say for sure...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> but I don&#39;t think Senpai is thinking about Uruk being destroyed. I don&#39;t think [♂ he /♀ she]&#39;s sad about leaving either.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably just a natural gesture to show gratitude. We&#39;ve stayed in this town longer than any other before.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So it&#39;s not about getting attached. It&#39;s just something normal for a human to do...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You two must have gone through a whole lot of goodbyes. You don&#39;t see them as something to mourn.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Goodbyes are always going to come. You can&#39;t get through life if they make you sad all the time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So you send them off with as much appreciation as you can. And rejoice in the fact that you met, and that you lived to say goodbye.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Your Order&#39;s a good journey.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I finally understand why Gilgamesh is so nice to you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-thank you. But...Um, was King Gilgamesh being...nice?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was “nice”?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wow...Ignorance is scary...I mean, right now he&#39;s acting weirdly like a wise king,</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> but he was never the kind of person who&#39;d make a plan that relies on other people.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> He&#39;s a brutal person at his core. He&#39;ll kill without a second thought, without the slightest regard for someone&#39;s circumstances or feelings.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> This time he&#39;s been playing the good-natured king, but when it&#39;s time to fight an opponent like Mother, I guess he turns into a proper hero.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It reminds me of when he was having fun with Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> He was, well, you know, pretty cool back then? Just like in your legends.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. But I think this King Gilgamesh is a man you can count on.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> He&#39;s got nothing left to lose now. I guess it&#39;s true that when the chips are down, people show who they really are.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You and Fujimaru are like that too. Oh...No, you&#39;re a little different.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I mean, you&#39;re scared of fighting, right? You&#39;re still not used to killing, or people trying to kill you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been told that before. But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t let it bother me anymore.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I once spoke with a certain Servant in a place like this, who told me something...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of in fearing battle. It&#39;s about taking lives. Of course it&#39;s scary.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Just as some people are more suited to certain weapons, there are those who are more suited to certain approaches to fighting.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Mash, you are not the type who can swallow fear during a fight, or get used to it.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> That fear will follow you your entire life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I know. But I want to conquer that fear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At this rate, I&#39;ll never be useful to Master.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...Excuse me.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Haha, I got a little overheated.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Tomorrow&#39;s the day we save Nippur. My fighting spirit is already soaring.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Anyway, back to what I was saying. You&#39;re not the type who can forget fear.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> You are the type who uses her courage to hold back the fear. That&#39;s the type of warrior who I trust and respect.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hold back fear with courage...? Um, are you that way too, Leonidas?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Hahaha. Unfortunately, I fear only the dead. I am a king, after all.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been trained since a very young age not to feel fear in battle.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m sorry...It&#39;s none of my business...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s true that I don&#39;t feel fear in battle...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> But I always feared going into battle. Leaving my country behind. Even to protect it.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> When I thought of the lives I was leaving behind, I gripped my spear so tightly I could crush it.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The worst of all was at Thermopylae.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The Persian enemy had 100,000 soldiers. And we only had three hundred Spartans.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> We were just a tiny part of the 7,000-strong Greek alliance.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> If we fought, we would be destroyed. But we were told if we surrendered and allowed the Persians to pass, they would spare Sparta.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Sparta was just a waypoint on their journey. Their true target was Athens, you see.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> But if we failed to stop them, Athens was doomed.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> It could only be for a single day, or perhaps a few more. But our tiny resistance could perhaps save the great kingdom of Athens.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> To choose faith, or to choose life. I didn&#39;t know which was right. And I felt a fear greater than ever before.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> To leave my wife and child for certain death.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I was beyond fearing my own death, but I was not used to fearing for my family&#39;s future.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...But you went to war anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And somehow you held back the 100,000 Persian soldiers for several days with only a few hundred...And died.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Was that because you went into battle afraid?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> No. I only went to battle when I conquered my fear. I was given a divine message, Mash.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> In my uncertainty, I prayed for guidance from the gods. And I received it.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> “If you go to war, you will never return to Sparta,” I was told.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> That rid me of my uncertainty. I knew I would be able to fight like before, without hesitation or fear.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wh-why? Even though you were told you would not come back?</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I was not told that it would be meaningless to fight. And that meant that even if we lost, Sparta would not fall.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> We would not return from the battlefield. But those deaths would have meaning.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I realized that even if we never came back, our battle was going to protect those who would come later.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> And then I finally realized...</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> It gave me the strength not to swallow my fear, but to replace it with hope.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> I bragged about this to my comrades: “Bet you didn&#39;t know that, did you? ” I said.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> “Everybody but you has been doing that this whole time. You&#39;re impressing no one. ”</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Hahaha. All three hundred of us started laughing. I really was a bit of a dolt.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Until that last battle, I&#39;d never realized the source of my comrades&#39; strength.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> ...No. At the very last moment, I was finally able to realize.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> If we - if I - caused a miracle at The Hot Gates, it was thanks to that.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Listen to me, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The reason you fear battle is because you know many things you care about.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> The more of those things there are, the more you overcome that fear, the stronger your heart becomes.</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> That will be your greatest weapon. As long as your heart does not break with fear—</p><p><strong>Leonidas:</strong><br> Nothing will ever stain your shield. You will never be defeated.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Huh. He must&#39;ve been an amazing Servant. He&#39;s like the voice of reason.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. He was a wonderful man.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, all Heroic Spirits are great people.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m lucky to have been able to learn so much from all those wonderful people.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...I see. So that&#39;s why your name is Chaldea, huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...? What about Chaldea&#39;s name?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Chaldea isn&#39;t the name of a country. It&#39;s an observatory, right? This body knew about it.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re observing the planet. Just like the light of the stars in the night sky.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> There you can see the life of another person who shined in the distant past, separated by thousands of years.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> A story of the stars in the sky, and of this land. Weaving those together is what you, what Chaldea does.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure that wish is why I felt that I could work with you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You reached out your hand not to use us, but to know us.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If the youngest generation who “lives in the now” comes asking for help, no elder could refuse.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A story of the stars. The true meaning of the name Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, I don&#39;t know how deep its creator was thinking.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> By the way, Mash. Is there anyone that Fujimaru has special feelings for?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hyah!? Someone Senpai has special feelings for!? I don&#39;t really know! Why!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hmm, I&#39;m not really sure yet, but Ereshkigal seems to really like [♂ him /♀ her].</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I guess you could call it imprinting? [♂ He /♀ She] was the first human who treated her normally.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So I was just curious. We&#39;re basically sisters, you know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I...I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what Senpai did before coming to Chaldea...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but since coming to Chaldea, every day has been so busy, so, um...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> In other words, Fujimaru has nobody? Okay, this is getting fun! It&#39;ll be a three-way affair!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar!? An affair!? Between who and who and who!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou. Nkyu? Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you going to the ziggurat too, Senpai?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I thought I&#39;d talk to the king one last time.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hee hee. Me, too. It was kind of like a daily ritual, after all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go together.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, with pleasure. I&#39;ll stay with you to the end, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What? The map of the underworld doesn&#39;t match what Ereshkigal said!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The priests have some documents on the underworld! Go get them now!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No, the Dingir can stay where they are. Keep them on the walls in all directions.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Dingir on the south and east gate can intercept Tiamat. Deploy the remaining soldiers there.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph...Leave us for a moment. The Chaldean messengers are here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This is a good time for a break anyway. Sleep for three hours or so. I&#39;ll handle the rest.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;re looking a little better. That means I can work you even harder tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So what is it tonight? Come for one final goodbye, have you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It won&#39;t be the last.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Heh, listen to you. You&#39;ve got me there.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You look busy as always.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There aren&#39;t enough people. I never thought I&#39;d have to run around to the temples or talk to the priests myself.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If Siduri were alive— No, I shouldn&#39;t have said that. She fulfilled the duty heaven set for her.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...But, hmm...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh? You got quiet. Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Nothing. I was just thinking you haven&#39;t changed at all. You look so frail for someone who spent a month in Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The way you look, even after you go back to Chaldea, no one will believe the stories you tell them.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Tricking the goddess on Mt. Ebih. The grand battle in the jungle. Descent into the underworld. Defeating Gorgon. And encountering Tiamat...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> They&#39;re all amazing stories to tell over drinks. It&#39;s truly a shame.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, foou!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll think of something for you to tell them about Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So, what is it? You didn&#39;t come here just to say goodbye, did you?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Idiots. It seems you mongrels feel responsible somehow.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “Uruk fell. Many people died. It&#39;s all my fault for releasing Tiamat. ” Is that it?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fools. No one&#39;s interested in your repentance. And your misunderstanding is embarrassing.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Mash. You told me that only five hundred people survived from Sumer, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s wrong. It wasn&#39;t “only” five hundred. It was the great number of five hundred.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> After all, this present is different than the one I saw. In my vision, I was the only one left in Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But what now? It&#39;s true that the end can&#39;t be changed. Uruk&#39;s destruction cannot be averted.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But five hundred survived. Even if they die tomorrow—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Here, at this final moment, that is how many humans remain. I consider that a great achievement.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I acknowledge the worth of those who still struggle against a fated death. They have passed through the terminus of this era.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...King Gilgamesh, you knew, didn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That the end was coming. That Uruk would be destroyed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And yet you fought anyway?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. The Mage King sent the Grail to this era, and pulled Tiamat from the World of the Void.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> At that point, I foresaw the future and told my people:</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “Uruk will be destroyed in six months. This doom cannot be averted. ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to say what came after that. You saw all of it with your own eyes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The people of Uruk knew—</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And they still fought. They tried their hardest to survive till the last day.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I like that smile, Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If you were to take pity on them, I would have ended your life here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-right! That was inappropriate. I&#39;m sorry, king!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to be sorry. Ugh, how humble can you get?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fujimaru. I thought that there was no need to defeat the goddesses.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even if we did, Tiamat would still appear. I was certain that the three goddesses would destroy themselves.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But you saved the people of Uruk, had compassion for this land, and chose to fight the goddesses.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And this was the result. You saved the lives of five hundred people who were fated to die.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You should be proud of that. It is not a useless thing.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Romani seems to be asleep. In that case, here&#39;s some unsolicited advice.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This is about Humanity and the Singularities. You&#39;ve traveled through six Singularities so far.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You must have fought many battles in the Singularities.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But when the Grail is recovered and the Foundation of Humanity is restored, all the damage from that Singularity is erased—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Was that what you were told?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Once the Incineration of Humanity has been stopped, everything that occurred during a Singularity is repaired...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and nobody remembers anything that we did.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s a lie. It&#39;s not true. The lives lost will not be restored. What happened can never be undone.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But— But that wasn&#39;t what we were told! The Singularities are anomalies in history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If that damage were reflected in human history, the whole course of history would have to change!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it. That&#39;s not it at all. It&#39;s just made to match.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> For example, let&#39;s say a dragon kills someone. And then you make the Singlularity disappear. The Incineration of Humanity is prevented.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even then, that person is still dead.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Instead of being killed by a dragon, history will remember them as having been killed by some beast.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Uruk is the same. Even if you defeat Tiamat and remove the Singularity...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The first dynasty of Uruk will fall. All that changes is the explanation: whether it was at the gods&#39; hands, or it simply deteriorated.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then our fight...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It doesn&#39;t result in “it didn&#39;t happen. ” I told you to be proud, right?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;ve truly saved many lives.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Do not be deluded by the notion that everything will go back to normal. You stubbornly, somewhat awkwardly, saved the lives in front of you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And the result is what you see now in Uruk. All your choices had a meaning.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In nature, there&#39;s no glory without sacrifice. Loss and gain are always balanced.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Much is lost, and much is gained.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even without the Mage King causing chaos with the Grail, something just as bad would happen eventually.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The people of that era will weigh the scales of good and evil themselves, and their value will be judged by future generations.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That is how human history is made, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Neither you nor I can say what came of your battles, what you protected, or what you left behind.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Only those who come after you will know. So for now, follow the path you choose.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. We&#39;ll take your words to heart, King Gilgamesh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, King Gilgamesh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Right. See you tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine. Don&#39;t worry about it. You know, I destroyed my own country once, too.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Yes, when I was spending all my time looking for immortality. I wandered for so long, and came back empty-handed to a desolate country.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The citizens were so sick of their absent king that they all went to other cities. Only Siduri was left.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And even Siduri just said, “I wasn&#39;t going to leave until I got a chance to complain to you. ” Hahaha.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I realized that was unworthy of a true king, and decided to rebuild Uruk, since I was in search of a new goal anyway.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And so I came up with the idea of fortress cities, and made Uruk what it is today.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Humph. At once, it feels like an age, and the blink of an eye. It&#39;s like a single remnant of a dream.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But I haven&#39;t repented or anything, you know. Who I am will never change.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> A king doesn&#39;t live for his people. The people live for their king.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But then what does a king live for? What else? He lives for the things he finds joy in.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If anything, I ruled over Uruk for my own entertainment.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And one of the things that entertained me was your struggles.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I haven&#39;t seen the result yet, but you&#39;ve done well enough.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Tomorrow is the last day. Get some rest. I&#39;m looking forward to the last fight, you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course. Leave it to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m gonna do SO much better than “well enough”!</p><hr><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...So this is the Celestial Hill...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> This is so stupid...Why did I...come here just before the end?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> It&#39;s a place this body remembers well.... The place where they made the first friend, and made a vow...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s meaningless. This place is meaningless, and so am I.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve lost everything. I should just shut down.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> My creator abandoned me, and I never even had a place to return to. I&#39;m just a fake, after all.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What are you doing? Why don&#39;t you stand, fool?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe this. Just how busy can it get tonight? I thought I could finally rest, but now I stumble on you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I will forgive you for dripping blood everywhere, and for falling to your knees. But I won&#39;t allow you to put your corpse on display here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Get up, and begone. If you go, I will ignore your crimes.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Ah...Aaahh...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What&#39;s wrong? Can&#39;t you stand? Weren&#39;t you supposed to be the gods&#39; greatest creation?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what happened, but you&#39;ve got a huge hole in your chest. Talk about letting your guard down.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Wh-what gives you the right...To look down on me...! I won&#39;t let you...!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Dammit...! I can&#39;t...Let you...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let you...see me like this...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Humph. Come to think of it, this thing&#39;s still been sitting around.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I missed the chance to use it. And it feels silly to just throw it away. You can have it.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Wha—H-huh!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Humph. I know you were using the Grail as a heart before. The Great Grail of Uruk will work just as well.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Why—</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Why are you doing this!? I&#39;m your enemy! Tiamat made me!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I&#39;m not your Enkidu...! I&#39;m just a doll, with a different heart inside...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You&#39;re not Enkidu. You&#39;re someone else using a stolen body.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But even so, you are still worthy of my protection—No, my friendship.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Do I have to spell it out, you hopeless fool!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even if your heart and soul are different, that body of yours is the one and only Chain of the Heavens on Earth!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Humph. Once, someone insisted they were a weapon to the very end.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But if I had taken them at their word, then it&#39;s only natural for me to care for you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> After all, you&#39;re the successor to the weapon I trusted most! What&#39;s wrong with me favoring you?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Farewell, Kingu. It&#39;s the end of the world. Do as you will.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Wait...I don&#39;t understand. What do you...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;m telling you that, no matter who your mother is or how you were born, simply do the things you really want to do.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Like we once did. You said you lost everything? That&#39;s laughable.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You still have your freedom. You can shut down your heart later.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> What—It&#39;s too late. I never had a goal I could strive for.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I never had a will of my own to choose freedom—</p><h2 id="section-20-absolute-demonic-front-mesopotamia-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-20-absolute-demonic-front-mesopotamia-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 20: Absolute Demonic Front Mesopotamia (I)</h2><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s dawn! Did everyone get enough rest? Then I shall brief you all on last night&#39;s survey results! Look here!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Oh. This is a diagram of Tiamat&#39;s true form? This is made really well. How&#39;d you do it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hehe, it&#39;s a collaboration between me and Uruk&#39;s priests! Based on their information, I polished it up!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Yes. Good work on that front. But now, take a look at her legs.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> From last night til dawn, we received several reports from the surviving academic facilities near the coast.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “Tiamat is walking on the water&#39;s surface. ” “It doesn&#39;t look like she can control her own weight. ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> “We hypothesize that those legs may be too thin to support that giant body. We should assume Tiamat can only walk on water. ”</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That was the final report. Both myself and Chaldea believe this theory is dead-on.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If it wasn&#39;t, there&#39;s little reason to encroach on the land like that.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Its purpose is to engulf the land, but at the same time it creates a pathway for Tiamat—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right. Like rails for trains. We think it&#39;s a path made for her to travel.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even if we can&#39;t kill Tiamat on land, if we get rid of the ocean around her, we can stop her movement.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Therefore, our combat objective shifts from Tiamat to that black mud. We will remove it entirely!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Chaldea has named that black mud, “Encroaching Ocean: Chaos Tide. ” They&#39;re feverishly analyzing a way to revert it to normal seawater.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If they make it in time, we can delay Tiamat&#39;s arrival at Uruk...</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh! A report from the south observation post! Tiamat has resumed her advance!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Three hours till she reaches the ruins of Girsu City! We estimate eight more hours until she reaches Uruk City!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s half a day earlier than expected! Even if we analyze in time, we won&#39;t have time to get rid of the Chaos Tide!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ugh, she is an early riser for such a massive creature. If so, we must destroy those legs, even if it seems impossible!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> General, take fifty elites from the wall! We will ride to battle!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> No, there&#39;s no need for that, Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The warriors have the job of intercepting Tiamat at the city wall, right?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I will be the one to remove that black mud...No, the Chaos Tide.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I can&#39;t do an entire ocean&#39;s worth, but my Noble Phantasm is enough to clear a perimeter around Tiamat once she gets ashore.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I will use my Sun&#39;s Pilgrimage: Piedra del Sol to vaporize the mud right out from under her, yes!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Oh, you had that! We&#39;re finally going to see the paw-some scorching lady Quetzalcoatl getting serious!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Piedra del Sol...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes! My Noble Phantasm that was at the altar in Eridu!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If Fujimaru had shattered the sunstone back then, we wouldn&#39;t have been able to use it now, no!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yup. Truly the devil&#39;s luck. In Fujimaru&#39;s case, you never know what strange thing they do will end up being fortuitous!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! The results of “Operation: Plancha, Not Destruction” have worked out in our favor!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Can you do it, Quetzalcoatl? Can I trust you with this?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Si. But it&#39;s still dangerous. Piedra del Sol uses a lot of stamina.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> So, I need to have Fujimaru take me right up to Tiamat...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...and continuously supply me with magical energy while I use my Noble Phantasm.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Sooo, you&#39;re saying we need to somehow deal with the Laḫmu flying around, get right under Mother&#39;s legs...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...and then, stay there the entire time Quetzalcoatl is deploying her Noble Phantasm!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Right on all counts! It&#39;s terribly dangerous, yes!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> All right, let&#39;s do it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Quetzalcoatl!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fine. Since Fujimaru agrees as well, we shall now commence our operation to intercept Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> All soldiers, to your posts!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> From now on, the only one left in the ziggurat will be the king! No matter what, you WILL NOT depart from the wall!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, my king! Fortune be with you, King Gilgamesh!</p><p><strong>Uruk Soldier:</strong><br> We wish to show the greatest gratitude and respect for your leadership and achievements, Your Majesty!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You too. Fight for me until the very end.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now go, Master of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> When you&#39;ve completed the mission, return to me here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;ll listen to your report of victory to kill some time. Don&#39;t make me wait too long!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re on our way, King Gilgamesh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve left Uruk!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, we will now guard Quetzalcoatl as she heads towards Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that correct?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. Right now, we&#39;re in a hurry calculating Tiamat&#39;s speed and field of vision.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s dangerous to position yourself right in front of Tiamat. We don&#39;t know what she&#39;ll do to enemies once she sees them.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A large number of Laḫmu are circling around Tiamat as well. Battling them will be inevitable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re verifying a route that won&#39;t be in Tiamat&#39;s line of sight with relatively few Laḫmu.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Can you wait for about two more minutes— What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I declare to all remaining citizens of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I commend you for surviving to this day. First and foremost, I am overjoyed at our success!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Over six months ago, when the Demonic Front was set up, I told all of you:</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No matter what we do, Uruk will fall. I will not determine for you how you should meet that end.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You can flee. You can drown in pleasures. You can throw yourselves down to the Underworld in despair.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> However, you all said you would fight. Despite knowing the end was coming, you were determined to resist.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Truly...Uruk was a fortunate city. Its history, its life, its people— Myself included.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The protection of gods is no longer needed in the world of man. As proof, I built a fortress, and you all answered to my call.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I know now, with certainty, that it was no mistake! And now this final trial will test it, and us, to the utmost.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now is the time to deny the primordial god, and begin the age of man! Mind yourselves, my elite warriors!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This is the battle for true separation from the gods! Give your lives to me, the king!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Pass on the glory that is Uruk to generations to come, to the last man!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Unbelievable. I didn&#39;t think he was that thoroughly prepared.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I saw that he built a lookout at the top of his ziggurat, but it was made just for this speech. How stupid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. The King of Heroes has returned.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah, I have to admit it as well. That troublesome king is most definitely one of the greatest pioneers.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And we&#39;re done! We have the fastest route to Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, Mash,</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ishtar, Quetzalcoatl, and Jaguar Warrior!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re at the point of no return for this battle. You&#39;ll all be pushed to your absolute limits. Are you prepared?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Commencing final Order!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Good. Then, as commander of Chaldea, I order you to commence the operation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Your objective is to approach Tiamat—Beast II, and bar its advance using Noble Phantasms!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This operation will end with the burning of the Chaos Tide! All of you, proceed to it with full strength!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, we&#39;ve entered Tiamat&#39;s field of vision! Laḫmu incoming!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s been two hours since we departed Uruk. I&#39;m tired of waiting! I&#39;ll take the vanguard. You okay with that, Quetzalcoatl?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Sí, of course. I can fight too, but if possible, let me save up my strength, yes!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I think you&#39;re already aware, but you&#39;re in Tiamat&#39;s territory!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No matter what you do, the Chaos Tide will also be eating away at you! Be careful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...! Commencing battle, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Increase in the number of Laḫmu and transformed Laḫmu! The potency of the Chaos Tide is also rising!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It seems the closer we get to Tiamat, the stronger the corruption gets!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If it&#39;s this bad so far away, it&#39;s going to be much worse by her feet!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Yeah, and the Laḫmu are getting stronger, meow! They&#39;ve gotta be stronger than me-eow!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just their forms, but their magical circuits have been strengthened...Did they evolve even more overnight...!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, what&#39;s going on with Tiamat? Has she noticed you!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;re still fine...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t even catch up!</p><hr><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Human—</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Human, human, human, human, human, human, human, human, human, human, human, human, human, human!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> There&#39;s too many to deal with! Fujimaru, run!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ?! Was that—</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The javelin unit from Girsu! Some must have survived!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But there aren&#39;t even thirty of them! If they try to go after the Laḫmu like that...!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> There! There! Fun, fun! Weak beings! Fun!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No good! We can&#39;t make it back—</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Jaguar! Run interference! It looks like there are other humans fighting out there!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Show me your speed! We&#39;re going to try to save as many of them as possible!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Okay, leave it to me! As the beautiful beast of the wasteland, Jaguar Warrior, I&#39;d run thousands of miles to help you, Kuku!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> This is going to hurt quite a bit, but I&#39;m going to go crazy, and get the attention of those Laḫmu!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Fujimaru, take care of Kuku! She gets really angry and scary when things get bad!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Jaguar Warrior of the wasteland!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know! I&#39;ve seen her scary face!</p><hr><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Meohaha! Good! All right! The way of the Jaguar is found in death!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Jaguar has pulled away from the main group...! All that&#39;s left is—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> For us to push forward on our own! I&#39;m getting excited!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Come, Laḫmu. I&#39;m going to feather you all with my arrows! No matter how many of you come at me, I won&#39;t let you lay a finger on Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Tiamat&#39;s still speeding up! This is bad! She&#39;s going to reach the Fangs of Napishtim soon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If it&#39;s destroyed, the Chaos Tide will flood into Uruk!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If that happens, Uruk will be reduced to nothingness before Tiamat even reaches it...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know. Just a little further...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Serpents, faster...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master! Seven hundred meters until we reach Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At our current speed, we&#39;ll catch up in two minutes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Mash, be careful! Don&#39;t rush too much!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just the potency of the mud. Tiamat is causing shock waves with every step!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You&#39;ll go flying if you don&#39;t pay attention! Make sure you lower your center of gravity and hang on!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right...! Master, watch out for the rearguard! From this point onward, anything can happen!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We did it! We&#39;ve caught up to Tiamat! Our plan is a go, Master!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yeah, we did it, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The chaos whatsit was getting stronger. Thank goodness we don&#39;t have to get any closer!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> (Even keeping this far away from Beast II, all this Spirit Origin corruption...If they end up having to fight head-on...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, things couldn&#39;t possibly get that bad! Quetzalcoatl, are you ready?!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes, leave it to me. I can go at any time. I&#39;m getting enough magical energy from Fujimaru, too.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We&#39;ve come this far— Get down, Mash!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> That&#39;s unfortunate. I wanted to get rid of your unsightly guardians first. I was a bit rash, again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru...! I see. I couldn&#39;t detect her through the Chaos Tide&#39;s interference!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru, are you planning on getting in our way again!? Have you truly become a slave to Tiamat...!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I believe I told you already. Mother&#39;s control is pleasant. I don&#39;t have to think.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I can focus on ridding myself of my hate. The greatest and only delectable pleasure I have is the thought of killing you all.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There aren&#39;t many humans left in the world. I have killed so many of them. I&#39;ve had enough sensation of the flesh.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left for me is to destroy Uruk with Mother. There is no greater ecstasy than killing a country, killing the land.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let you get in the way! If Mother&#39;s mud doesn&#39;t absorb you, then you need to die here.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Or maybe you would choose to become my retainers instead of Mother&#39;s? That would be pleasurable too.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> In just a few days, I will become one with Mother. Since we&#39;re friends, I could turn you into familiars fit to be Demon God Pillars.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;ll torment and treat you like insects. The same way my brother once treated me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is bad, Master. Ushiwakamaru is—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Yes. I know you know each other, but it&#39;s too late for her. She&#39;s all twisted up inside.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Fusion from self-replication. A melting of hundreds of selves together, and she&#39;s ready to burst from within.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t even want to imagine what type of monster would come out if that happened.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious. Only hatred towards humans would flow from my entrails. A tower of flesh made from hundreds and thousands of corpses.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I&#39;ll become a blood-crazed warrior, stronger than Gorgon, and kill all of you!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Gorgon, you say! Looks like you&#39;re aware that you&#39;re going to be defeated, vengeful one!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Fujimaru, let&#39;s do this! As long as she&#39;s there, I won&#39;t be able to use my Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to UTTERLY destroy that Darkened Servant!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Just try it! Your plan won&#39;t go anywhere as long as I&#39;m around!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> It doesn&#39;t make any difference how many of me you kill. Haven&#39;t you learned?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru has reappeared from the Chaos Tide! ...Damn, how do we defeat this thing!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ushiwakamaru&#39;s Spirit Origin is completely different now...But why—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why do you want to kill humans...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why are you working for Tiamat!?</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why do you want to kill humans...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why are you working for Tiamat!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Why, you ask...?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> What about all of you! Why do you fight so hard to protect humans!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You say that the Laḫmus are horrendous? That these monsters are ugly?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> But there is no difference. Humans or Laḫmus, there&#39;s no difference. They are the same!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Let&#39;s say there was a heroic deed done amidst a mass of tragedies. A miracle that happened among many sacrifices.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Out of all the people who only worked for profit, there was one who went around and helped the suffering and asked for nothing.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Such an achievement would only be taken advantage of, and then dishonored by those who failed to live up to that standard!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You humans are always like that! You all crowd around a miracle and then insult and laugh about it amongst each other!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Why would I want to fight for such creatures!? Why did we have to be killed!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> At this point I won&#39;t even try to correct your actions. Just die. Die, all of you!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Dying and starting from scratch is the only way left for this world.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s still multiplying!? Has this monster divided even its soul...!?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hahahahahahaha! I&#39;ll show you no quarter &#39;til the very end!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> As long as I am here, you will never touch Mother!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> I will tear you to bloody pieces! You can&#39;t stop all of my copies!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> That is impossible. Your number is meaningless in front of the last ray of hope.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> It is true the masses are ugly, however...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> How could you be the one to deny the only heroic deed?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...! Who&#39;s there!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> [♂ Lord /♀ Lady] Fujimaru! I apologize for my lateness!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Benkei!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re wounded all over...!</p><hr><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Nay, my limbs are still attached— Actually, I am now at my very best!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I am ashamed of my cowardice! But still, allow me to take responsibility for the crimes of my lord!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You, you were still alive...! I should have roasted you instead of showing you mercy!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Hey, let go! Let me go, you third-rate actor! There&#39;s no stage left for you at this point!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> No, I will not! This Musashibou will never let go! Not this time! Even death shall not separate us!</p><p><strong>F：Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...Fine. Then you shall die with me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The surrounding Ushiwakamarus have run them both through!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Humph. What were you going to do just taking one of me along with you?</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> You alone cannot do anything for me anymore. I told you that.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...You somehow hung onto that life. You should have just cowered in your corner until the end.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Such foolhardy courage is unlike you, Hitachibou.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Indeed. I&#39;m terrified.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...I thought I had made my peace, but it could never be enough. So this is the horror of a lone dash towards death...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Why, you! You&#39;re still...!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> However, what pushed me forward was not resolve. Anger. It was anger that pushed me forward.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Lord Ushiwakamaru. That hatred of yours does not come from Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> It was something that was always buried within you, pointed towards all humans.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...That was something I could not bear.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> No matter how much the others thought you strange, you lived free.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> ...Truly, there is nothing lonelier than genius. I never imagined you were alone till the very end.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Even if he could not save your heart, Benkei must not have wanted to leave you alone.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> For you to be consumed with such anger—I could not bear it.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Silence...! Argh, what are you doing, Ushiwakamaru!? Come! Slice his limbs off along with me! Chop his head off!</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There&#39;s no use in listening to a monk&#39;s lecture now!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Hahaha. You mustn&#39;t speak lightly of lectures. After all, even something such as this can be done if mastered.</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> Impossible! This is—How!? Y-you&#39;re peeling Tiamat&#39;s Authority off of me—</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> N-no, you&#39;re tearing me out of it...! Benkei, what have you...!?</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> I am just doing as Benkei does! This time, my lord, I shall be with you till the end!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> If our opponent is the Primordial Sea, then may this existence be of some small help!</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Now, let us burn all of our sins in the Western Paradise! Pilgrimage of the Five Hundred Arhat— Lord Yoshitsune.</p><p><strong>Benkei:</strong><br> Please forgive me for my long absence—</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> ...You fool. You always worried about such silly, petty things...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> There&#39;s no joy in taking the life of a coward like you...</p><p><strong>Ushiwakamaru:</strong><br> To think you were even called a sage...A fool will always be a fool...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Confirming the disappearance of both Benkei and Ushiwakamaru&#39;s Spirit Origins. Tiamat&#39;s guardians are gone...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yes. But there&#39;s no time to grieve. Quetzalcoatl, you ready?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Of course. Ready to goooo!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Everyone, after I fly off, move away from Tiamat. If you stay too close, you&#39;ll burn up along with everything.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re gonna be okay, right...?</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Don&#39;t give me that look, no! Just leave it to your big sis, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> All right then, I&#39;m gonna go burn off the face of the Earth...just a little!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Tiamat. The Primordial Sea that wove the base for all life.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> To see that you, of all beings, seek to destroy mankind and create a new world...My heart breaks for you, Tiamat...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> However...This world belongs to the humans! Without reason, without will, without soul...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...You elect to consume and destroy your own children in blind hatred! This, I cannot allow.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> South America&#39;s goddess lives with the forest and beasts! The sun blesses with life and creation, not destruction!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The past is here!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The present is here. The future is here! Come winds, come lightning!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> When the morning star shines, let all know the sun&#39;s light reaches every corner of the Earth!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Piedra Del Sol!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaaa, aaaaa—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl is flying! She&#39;s one hundred meters above Tiamat&#39;s head!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a...a massive heat source above her! It&#39;s the solar winds! The Chaos Tide is evaporating!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hothothot...! Mash, please block it! Come on Fujimaru, get behind Mash too!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Eep! She really is the principal deity of South America! That&#39;s one heck of a trump card she&#39;s got!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If she&#39;d used this on Uruk, it would&#39;ve burned to cinders in a—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ugh! The flying Laḫmu...! I knew it. They&#39;re not going to make this easy on me, no!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But you acted a little too late, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;ve done what I needed to do already! Now I&#39;ll just be on my way back to Master—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! The Chaos Tide has returned! No, this is—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tiamat! The Chaos Tide is flowing out from under Tiamat&#39;s feet!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl&#39;s Noble Phantasm has reappeared! She&#39;s deploying it again!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl...! Are you gonna burn yourself up...!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Urg...!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Stretching into needles and pulling an aerial move...What are you, missiles!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> They went through my shoulders, stomach, and thighs so easily...!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ouch...I can almost hear the ten second countdown...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ugh...I may be tough, but it&#39;s just a matter of time at this point...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> But still, I won&#39;t stop! No matter the cost, I&#39;ll keep...this...burning!!!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Come on, Ereshkigal, hurry! I&#39;m in this until you&#39;re done or they tear me to pieces!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hee...it&#39;s a mud wrestling match! I&#39;ll...draw this out...all day if I— What the!?</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...Ahhhh.... Aaaahhh. Aaaaaaahhh.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> (She&#39;s lifting her horns? )</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> (She&#39;s gathering the magical energy that held her body up above the mud into her horns...almost like wings...）</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> (...Oh no. This thing&#39;s gonna fly! )</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The solar winds have stopped! Quetzalcoatl is returning!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Hi, I&#39;m back! Tiamat...No, who cares what it&#39;s called now!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That thing is stupid tough and a cheater! Baaaad! If we fight it head-on, we&#39;ll get dropped to the mat muy rapido!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes, it looks like our plan was for nothing.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> We&#39;ve burned away the mud from the sea, but if the black mud comes from Mother, that doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get back to Uruk right away. We need to come up with a new plan.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> No, Ishtar. We can&#39;t do that.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You should know that already. There&#39;s no point in going back now.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If we don&#39;t stop Tiamat, all the work being done in Uruk as we speak will be for nothing.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Then what do you propose we do!? Watch you blast away with your sun until you die!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If we&#39;re down to you killing yourself, let&#39;s at least try MY last resort first...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> That won&#39;t work either, Ishtar.... That thing can fly.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fly...? With that massive body?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Ugh, give us a damn break...our entire plan...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes, just vaporizing the mud beneath her is not enough. If she can fly, then she won&#39;t fall.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be! Tiamat is the goddess of Ki, the Earth. She would never go near An, the heavens!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Who would have thought she could fly—</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Yes. So, Fujimaru? Excuse me a bit one last time.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wait, what are you doing!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This is the...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Okay, I&#39;ve got some energy back, yes! I&#39;ll go hit it again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What...? Quetzalcoatl, what are you going to do!? You&#39;re hurt! You can&#39;t fight properly in that state!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> No. I still have my limbs attached. I am the bird of fire. As long as I have wings, I will fly!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m going first. I leave the rest to you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> See you. I&#39;ll be expecting a spectacular lucha move.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Of course! Master, please watch too, yes!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give it my best aerial technique to knock it out!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...The weapons of Mesopotamia cannot hurt it...I was the one who said that.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> However! I am not a weapon of this world, but a Divinity of a distant mystic land!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The primordial god of Mesopotamia, you are nothing to me!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Witness the power of our underworld, Xibalba, and the cataclysmic impact that annihilated countless lives!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I shall burn everything away and become the comet that killed the Earth!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Here I go...Ultimo Tope Patada! Burning fighting spirit, Xiuhcoatl!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Quetzal...coatl...Her flame&#39;s extinguished and has fallen into...the black sea...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Beast II has pulled back a bit...But her main body shows no signs of damage...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Quetzalcoatl&#39;s final Noble Phantasm did nothing to put Tiamat back in her place...</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaaahhh AaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She&#39;s discharging more Chaos Tide! Beast II is fighting back...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is bad! The Fangs of Napishtim...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Chaos Tide is coming this way! A large number of Laḫmu are approaching, as well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, your orders, please! I can&#39;t allow us to run away after all of this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Fangs of Napishtim have fallen! The Chaos Tide is flowing towards Uruk!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Detecting a magical energy surge emanating from Beast II&#39;s back! A massive expansion of the dorsal skeletal structure...She&#39;s going to fly!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ishtar, can&#39;t you do something!? Weren&#39;t the Mesopotamian skies your domain?!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> If there was, I would&#39;ve done it already...! But my bow is useless against an original Divinity...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tiamat is flying...! She&#39;s going to head towards Uruk—No, something is wrong!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s something coming from the Chaos Tide...That&#39;s...!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaahhh AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A black snake...? Several large snakes have appeared, and have coiled around Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> She&#39;s falling! That&#39;s—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wow...They&#39;re beating Mother with sheer strength...!? What&#39;s going on!? Where did they come from!?</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Let go...Let go! Let go! Let go! You dirty fakes...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Pah. You&#39;re the dirty ones. You&#39;re mindless hunks of mud, and you&#39;re laughing like humans.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Gorgon! I don&#39;t believe it! This Spirit Origin signature belongs to Gorgon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru, watch out! Gorgon might be there with you!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctor, quiet!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ROMAN, SHUT UP!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you, Gorgon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please, help us...!</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...I do not care about you. I will have my vengeance against Tiamat for myself, not for you.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Do not interfere, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XAqlQYL.png" alt="1-light"></p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...Aaaahhh.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...A mere avatar will not serve...I suppose I need to be in my own true body...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Gorgon. Are you going to help us?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...I said you were an eyesore. You all are in the way.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> If I have to see you for another second, you&#39;ll only anger me that much more. Hurry and run back to Uruk.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I will smash Tiamat&#39;s wings. I shall teach her that it is SHE who slithers across the ground.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-then we will help! We can fight together aga—</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> You mock me. You, who could hardly handle the Laḫmu, and have lost Quetzalcoatl. You have nothing left.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Look at your Master&#39;s fingertips. They are on the verge of necrosis from the drain of magical energy.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> You cannot even lift your shield.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> How exactly will you help me? The weak should scurry back home.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go back to Uruk, Mash.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Good. You should know your limits.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...We can count on you, right?</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I told you, I am not here for you. Now leave. Immediately.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The fourth wave is coming! The Chaos Tide is going to swallow you up if you stay there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, Fujimaru, withdraw immediately! Gorgon is right. You have to run!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Mash. We don&#39;t have Quetzalcoatl&#39;s winged serpents anymore.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;ll have to run while carrying Fujimaru. Or would you rather have me do the honors?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But once aboard my boat, Maanna, your Master is mine. Even if the Singularity gets repaired, I&#39;m not returning them to Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s no good!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, don&#39;t put me on that boat!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...But Senpai...! Gorgon is A—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t say it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! I-I...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Leave. Farewells are unnecessary. I don&#39;t care about any of you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Right. Goodbye, Gorgon.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you for everything.</p><hr><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> ...Now that I think on it, I didn&#39;t say a proper goodbye.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> But...I did get the flowers. That&#39;s enough for me.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Tiamat. I didn&#39;t send Fujimaru back to Uruk just to get [♂ him /♀ her] away from you.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want—</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want [♂ him /♀ her] to see me as a monster. I think...that would just hurt [♂ him /♀ her], and after everything...[♂ He /♀ She] doesn&#39;t deserve that.</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> But you...I will rend you to the bone! This is what we both deserve!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> I will be the Great Snake and bring the Earth Dragon down! Composite Deity, united threshold...!</p><p><strong>Gorgon:</strong><br> Melt everything! Pandemonium Cetus!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> ...Aaaaaahhh AAAAaaaaahhh.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Tiamat&#39;s right horn has been destroyed. I can–I have visual confirmation that Gorgon is dead...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...Tiamat is...She&#39;s still going...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know it&#39;s tough, but you have to hurry and get out of there!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A fifth wave of Chaos Tide! There&#39;s nothing blocking its way! More black mud coming in fast!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Get to Uruk before the Chaos Tide swallows you up! Hurry!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right! Master, excuse me!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have to use the time Gorgon and Quetzalcoatl bought us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We can&#39;t waste another second!</p><p><strong>Bel Laḫmu:</strong><br> Kiki! Kikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikiki!</p><p><strong>Bel Laḫmu:</strong><br> Fun! Stupid! Two goddesses. Look at outcome!</p><p><strong>Bel Laḫmu:</strong><br> Ten minutes! Ten minutes! Just ten minutes! Just a little! Only little! Stopped us a second!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Scum. No matter how they try to imitate language, they&#39;re still half-wits.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> So that was the best we could do.... I suppose there are some good goddesses out there, after all.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No one could have predicted Tiamat could fly. It&#39;s a miracle they stopped it.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If those two hadn&#39;t given their lives, Uruk would have fallen.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But we still don&#39;t have enough time! How&#39;s it going, not-so-great goddess?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Now there&#39;s a path for the Chaos Tide! Tiamat will be here in two hours!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How&#39;s work on the gate of the underworld going!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Don&#39;t ask for the impossible! I&#39;m pouring in magical energy, but it&#39;s just too big!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Even working ourselves to death all over again, we&#39;re just barely able to keep this pace up!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I can&#39;t get started on opening the gate!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Gah...! I thought that might be the case...Is there nothing we can do?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...No, such questions are pointless. That&#39;s why they&#39;re running back there right now.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Very well. Come forth, Tiamat! The entirety of Uruk will drive you back into the World of the Void!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hurry and make your return, Master of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I will show you my final move, putting all Uruk on the line!</p><h2 id="section-21-absolute-demonic-front-mesopotamia-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-21-absolute-demonic-front-mesopotamia-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 21: Absolute Demonic Front Mesopotamia (II)</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Doctor, we&#39;ve returned to Uruk. But this is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yes. The only life signs I&#39;m picking up inside Uruk are you, King Gilgamesh...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...and eight soldiers still taking out Laḫmu from the ramparts.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But it&#39;s just as King Gilgamesh said...Even if we fix the Singularity...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No, Uruk won&#39;t be destroyed. As long as Gilgamesh and you are here, we still...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Let&#39;s hurry to the ziggurat. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s up there, watching until he&#39;s the last one remaining!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> More. Still more! More humans! Fun! Fun!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> Everything destroy! Fun! What fun! They still alive!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> They&#39;re getting on my nerves! Let&#39;s take them out, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You&#39;re back? Has it been half a day? Funny, it seems like it was just a moment ago. All right.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Take a look. This is Uruk in its entirety. One more step and it will be wiped off the land. The end of the world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Chaos Tide...is in the city...Our embassy, too...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Terrible. I took my anger out on Uruk in various ways before...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...but this is going too far...Does Mother hate humans that much...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Who knows? The voice of that Beast does not seem to reach us. First off, does that thing even have a mind of its own?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> It&#39;s a mechanism that only exists to destroy the world.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The moment it turned into an Evil of Humanity, I assume it ceased to be the Tiamat you knew through your father.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Then how are we going to stop Mother? Unless she has someone she can take her hatred out on, there&#39;s no way.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> True. All of the things that Tiamat spawned, their evil should end once old Mesopotamia perishes.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But enough chatter. Here she comes. Our Mother appears.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ishtar, take to the sky! You can fly, so there is no reason for you to remain on Celestial Hill!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Stand by in the sky! Hover above those dark clouds, directly under the sun! I&#39;ll issue instructions when ready!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Got it. Fujimaru, take care of him.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> He&#39;s way too confident for a human. Keep a close watch in case he does something stupid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Leave it to me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Of course.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Thank you. I&#39;m glad, knowing you&#39;ll be with him. Well, I&#39;ll see you later!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You fool! Fujimaru isn&#39;t sticking with me! I&#39;m sticking with Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Mm? Wait, no. Aargh, I&#39;ll sort it out later!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Don&#39;t stand there looking so conceited. Be careful and watch closely, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This is Uruk&#39;s last stand against Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Dingirs mounted on the city walls are firing! But how? The soldiers are all—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahaha! Do not underestimate my magical energy, plebe!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> All 360 Dingirs mounted on the walls were made by MY hand, infused with MY magical energy, and controlled by ME!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If I work this body to death, I can control them all like this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But what about the lapis lazuli used to detonate them!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t crush that with a hammer, we can&#39;t fire the Dingirs!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Lapis lazuli is just a substitute for magical energy! I can take care of the detonation myself!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Incredible...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So this is the ancient king&#39;s power...!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Fwahaha, who do you think I am!? I am the supreme king who, much as it irritates me, bears the blood of both god and human!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I&#39;ll show you what I can do to stop Tiamat!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s that light...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ughn...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Mash, I think I died...</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How dare you try to snipe me!? But you have good aim. Impressive, you damned Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Gi—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hah! Worry not, it is only a mortal wound!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> What about you fools!? Are you all right!? You&#39;re all right!? Very well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A-are you still going to fire the Dingirs in your condition!? Please stop, you&#39;re clearly in no condition to...!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Are you saying it&#39;s impossible? That I am at my limit? That Uruk cannot fight anymore!?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Is that what you&#39;re saying, Fujimaru!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...No. No!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Uruk is far from finished!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well said! Then it is time to get serious!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I mean, I was going all out from the start, but I do have a king&#39;s vanity! Still, your brazen words have driven me on that much more!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Tiamat has reached Uruk! Three more minutes until she reaches the ziggurat!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> On top of that, we&#39;ve confirmed a huge discharge of Laḫmu! A Laḫmu horde is coming ahead of Tiamat...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There are over 8,000 of them! Escape into the ziggurat! There&#39;s nothing else that can be done!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Grrr, a direct attack on the ziggurat! Both of them are out!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash, Fujimaru! I need you to wake up! If you don&#39;t...!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The Laḫmu clumped together and body-slammed the roof? Seriously!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> They&#39;re like Gugalanna&#39;s hoof! The ziggurat&#39;s rooftop—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Gilgamesh is standing firm. Good! The other two...Not good! They&#39;re out cold!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hold on. I&#39;ll scatter the Laḫmu wall and be right—Huh?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That contrail...Something is flying directly towards the ziggurat—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Kingu!?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> 2,000 Laḫmus left. A pittance.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Humph. Didn&#39;t I tell you? As long as I have a heart, you creatures are no match against me.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> To be having trouble against this mass-produced trash shows how useless those obsolete humans truly are.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...And yet, they had the gall to talk back to me. Both that Master of Chaldea and the other one.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> For all their show of confidence, they couldn&#39;t do anything alone, and they knew it. But they survived to the end.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...Heh-heh. I can do anything alone, huh? The moment I thought that proved that I was imperfect.</p><p><strong>Bel Laḫmu:</strong><br> Kingu...!? Kingu. You say!? How. You alive!? How you. Still be moving!?</p><p><strong>Bel Laḫmu:</strong><br> No. Ask why. Reason. Why— you ally? With the humans...!?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...I haven&#39;t sided with humans. I am a new type of human entirely. I am Kingu, the one and only member of the new humanity.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...Forget about Mother, or my origins...Do something I truly want to do, huh?</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s not what I am. That&#39;s not who I was. That wasn&#39;t me, Gil.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> But...when I think about it, there was one thing.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> I wanted to see you. I wanted to talk to you.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> All of the memories left in this heart and my impressions of them. I wanted to share them with you, as your friend.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> But that can&#39;t happen. That wish wasn&#39;t mine. It belonged to the machine called Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...And my wish is the same as it&#39;s always been.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> It has nothing to do with new humanity or old humanity. I was born into this world in order to preserve it.</p><p><strong>F：Tiamat:</strong><br> AAAAAAaahhhhhh ...Kinnnnnguuuu.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Farewell, Mother. You chose the wrong child.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...Yes. I don&#39;t really understand what he said, but...</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> ...This body remembers what it&#39;s supposed to do.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Great Grail of Uruk, lend me your power.</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Kingu, son of Tiamat, will show you the power of the Chain of the Heavens!</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Mother&#39;s fury is a thing of the past. Now I will awaken the breath of stars—</p><p><strong>Kingu:</strong><br> Enuma Elish! Humans, let us bind the gods!!!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oww...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you all right, Mash!?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. It seems the impact knocked me out.... Where are Tiamat and the Laḫmu!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Oh. Take a look.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Those are chains...or something like chains binding Tiamat...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is that...? And how much time has passed...?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Ah, you&#39;re awake.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Do you feel a little rested? Splendid. Then I will leave the rest to you.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> As you can see, Tiamat is right at our doorstep.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Just a few more steps over here and this ziggurat will be reduced to ashes.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hah. But it&#39;s frustrating her. With those chains, even a single step is so difficult.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...It was only a momentary restraint, but for her, a mind-numbing eternity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Goodbye, celestial orphan. This feat, here, was equal to any in your life before—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The Chain of the Heavens even held back the physical strength of a god of creation.</p><p><strong>F：Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaaa— AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!</p><p><strong>G：Ereshkigal:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh, can you hear me!? This is Ereshkigal of the Underworld!</p><p><strong>G：Ereshkigal:</strong><br> The phase transition between underground Uruk and the underworld is done! We just need to dig a hole!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Got it. Did you hear that, Ishtar?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Of course. I&#39;ve been ready and waiting. For an hour. I&#39;ve been watching you make faces I&#39;ve never seen before.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...But are you sure about this? You have no regrets?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Of course not. What is there to be sad about?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I sent my friend off twice.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The first time I was mourning. But this time is different. His proud, valiant figure is burned into my memory for eternity.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Come on. That&#39;s not what I am talking about, dummy.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...(Sigh) Even till the end, you don&#39;t think of me?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Well, that doesn&#39;t matter to me now...Perhaps it&#39;d be a bit annoying if I was ONLY Ishtar...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> All right! That&#39;s enough melodramatic speechifying from me!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The future will take care of itself...Now I&#39;m gonna scatter every regret to the winds!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Here I go, Goldie, Fujimaru! As requested, I&#39;m going to punch through the ground beneath your feet with no mercy!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Humph. Finally, the true split with the gods...</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I certainly spouted quite a lot of nonsense, even for me. Well, I suppose that means I cannot remain behind.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Master of Chaldea. Do you remember our conversation about being consistent with human history?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Uruk&#39;s destruction is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But if Tiamat and the starting point of this Singularity, myself, were to disappear, that conclusion would be interpreted a bit differently.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> The only thing that will vanish would be the reign of Uruk&#39;s fifth king. The era after, the sixth king, should be alive and well.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Tiamat is not the only one who must be defeated. After this, I too will no longer be needed.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> My only fear was in how I would die. Suicide, as a king, is out of the question.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I was troubled over what to do, but now, as luck would have it, I am mortally wounded. I thank you, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re thanking me...for that...?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Sometimes you are intolerable. That&#39;s not all I&#39;m thanking you for. Do not make me say more, fool.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Traveler from another land. Etch this into your mind:</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Even if everything in this era had been called into service, I have a feeling it would have ended here.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You are a foreigner, a foreign element in this period, and a surplus. However—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That very surplus was the thing that helped us face destruction we alone could not have overcome, and helped us make our final move.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...The time has come. I am leaving everything in your hands now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Beast II is right before us! She&#39;s stomping towards us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh, take cover!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Nonsense. I am the final lure. Come, Tiamat! Crush me!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> This is your grave—No, this is where we&#39;ll drag you down to hell!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Grab my hand...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-okay! I don&#39;t really get it, but this is an emergency situation, right, Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me this is...!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fouuu!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Crouch down, and anchor yourself to the ground!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ishtar&#39;s Noble Phantasm is going to hit the base of the ziggurat! Everyone, prepare for impact!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This way...!</p><hr><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Weeee&#39;rrrreeee faaaaaallllliiiinnnng!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, we&#39;re falling...! I can&#39;t see what&#39;s below us!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At this rate, we&#39;ll fall to our deaths before Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let that happen. Here, I give you permission to float in the underworld.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Gather magical energy in your feet and imagine the ground. That way, you should be able to hover a bit.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s Ereshkigal! Okay, I&#39;ll try!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad you two could make it. But pleasantries will have to wait. Behold!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is that...Tiamat!? Then we were successful in leading her to the underworld!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Yes, look up. You can see Uruk.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Ishtar destroyed the foundations of Uruk, bringing it all down here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The distance to the surface is over 2,000 meters...Impressive, so this is the underworld of the Age of Gods. I&#39;m almost not sure what I&#39;m looking at, is it deep, or...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But more importantly, what&#39;s that!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ishtar&#39;s Noble Phantasm set Tiamat ablaze and it doesn&#39;t seem to be going out!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s one of the underworld&#39;s security features. This happens to those who come without my permission.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> This law was laid down by the world itself. Nothing can survive once it&#39;s set off, not even Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> So, where is King Gilgamesh? Can we go ahead and deal the finishing blow?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> He said to wait until everyone arrived, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s necessary.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I think this is our one chance to press on.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Well...I agree. But Ereshkigal, King Gilgamesh is already...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...But we have to fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. You&#39;re right. Even if it&#39;s just us, we&#39;d better go ahead.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> All right? Then I&#39;m going to begin! Leave it to me. We don&#39;t need King Gilgamesh or Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I&#39;ll finish her off for you...! Hear me, gallû spirits, the spears of rotting flesh and death!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Feel the wrath of the iron hammer of Kur! Everyone, attack!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Well? That&#39;s about it. Here in Kur, even Tiamat is just another god.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> An all-out attack from me and the gallû spirits was enough to dispatch—to...dispa—</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Wh-wha—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Chaos Tide is corrupting the underworld! This is bad! It...it&#39;ll take over the whole underworld if it keeps spreading!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s not all...What is this reading!? Beast II&#39;s Spirit Origin is...It&#39;s growing!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Reversion to the Age of Gods has reached the Jurassic Age! It&#39;s no longer just a Servant possessing Divinity, this is an actual deity!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> H-h-huh!? Wh-wh-wh-what&#39;s happening!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Did I do something!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Spirit Origin inflation has halted, and the Magical Reactor Core is rebooting as well...! The wounds she sustained in the fall to the underworld are healing, too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s coming...! That—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s the true form of Beast II!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaaaa, AAAAAAAAAA—LaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tiamat is birthing more Laḫmu! They&#39;re spreading throughout the underworld!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Impossible! We can&#39;t possibly do this! We can&#39;t beat all of those by ourselves!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I mean, the wave&#39;s coming! It&#39;ll take over the underworld!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Quit whining, you dumb-dumb! And you call yourself the goddess of the land of death, meow!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re—</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Yes! It&#39;s a bird! It&#39;s a balloon! No, it&#39;s an optical illusion! I&#39;m the tiger that races through the underworld. People call me Jaguar Warrior!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you a little charred!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> It&#39;s a long story, so let&#39;s save it for later! Anyway, I&#39;m impressed you made it this far, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You sure raced over here!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Yes, I did. And then, when I got to Uruk, it was fiiiiiine that you didn&#39;t ask me to join you, so don&#39;t be concerned about that.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;m impressed you made it this far, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Tiger! A tiger has come to the underworld! I don&#39;t believe it! Is that really a legit tiger!?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Read &#39;em and weep, little girl! Now stop complaining and continue with that paw-some attack!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> B-but it wasn&#39;t having any effect...! And Kur&#39;s output is dropping as a whole!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Even if it isn&#39;t effective, we have no other choice! Listen, you may not believe it, but Tiamat is at her weakest right meow!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> But if we don&#39;t do something, right here, never mind the end of humanity! It&#39;ll be the end of everything!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Just see what happens if she makes it back to the surface! In less than a day, she&#39;d cover the whole world in that mud!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, no...Doctor, is what she said...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s true! Most of the underworld has already been consumed by the Chaos Tide as we speak!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can&#39;t let it get to the surface! You have to get rid of it here at all costs!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Luckily, the Chaos Tide and the Laḫmu are all part of Tiamat. They don&#39;t count as “other life! ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you kill Tiamat while she&#39;s in the underworld, she shouldn&#39;t be able to manage her paradoxical restoration!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> But there&#39;s already so much mud! How are we supposed to fight Tiamat under these circumst—</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> What the hell is that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Blooming flowers...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me those flowers are...!</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Chaos Tide&#39;s spread...stopped entirely!? Or has all its Authority been used up and turned into regular mud!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It may be unbelievable, but those flowers are draining Tiamat&#39;s power!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> All right, I made it in time! You have a poor imagination, Archaman!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> When faced with a sea that births life, all you have to do is use that life for something less horrible and more helpful!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> And if that&#39;s the case, the spotlight is mine! After all, I enjoy bolstering my reputation as the Mage of Flowers!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ack! Meeeerlin!? How can you be here!? Don&#39;t tell me you were re-summoned!? No, no, no!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Hahaha, no, of course not. Re-summoning is impossible. There&#39;s a simpler explanation.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I am the real deal, the genuine Merlin. I just popped over from Avalon!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooou! Kyuuuu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How did you get here?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay, but how the hell did you get here?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ah, with the Earth a blank slate from humanity&#39;s incineration, I was able to sneak through fairyland!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I do hate sad partings. Letting death be what separates us would have just been too depressing!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Therefore, I bent the rules just a liiiiiittle bit and escaped my tower of imprisonment. In order to see you folks, of course.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! We&#39;ve been waiting for you, Merlin! We are thrilled to see you again!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Beast II has deployed horned wings from its back now! Look, I think Merlin pissed it off!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He may have stopped the mud from encroaching on the underworld, but not Beast II itself! It&#39;s trying to fly back up to the surface of Uruk!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Its wings were restored...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, what else you got, Mage of Flowers?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Hmmm. Two goddesses trying to ground her, a pitfall into the underworld with Uruk as bait,</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...the Chain of the Heavens binding her, the punishment of the underworld, and my beautiful flowers.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Fujimaru. And Heroic Spirits. You have tried everything under the sun to get even this far.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But it&#39;s still not enough.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She still does not know fear. She has no natural enemy. She is unfamiliar with he whom I dub “Death. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> “He”...? Is someone else helping you?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes, indeed. A powerful ace that I&#39;ve kept up my sleeve.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But who summoned him? It wasn&#39;t King Gilgamesh. Nor the Mage King&#39;s Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...I shouldn&#39;t even have to say. It was you, Fujimaru, of course.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> He said he would abandon his Grand title to show you his gratitude. And the enemy is the Evil of Humanity, a Beast.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> From the beginning, the conditions were right for him to appear in this land. There was meaning to all of your battles.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You don&#39;t mean...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So the reason why Fujimaru&#39;s vitals dissapeared in the underworld last time was because...!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Now, look up at the sky, primordial sea! Look up, goddess of life, and know Death.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> All that begins must end. So, too, all that lives, dies, and in dying, value finds. Thy vaunted eternity is but hollow slumber.</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Beast of Disaster, evil born of mankind&#39;s folly, thy desperate wish that thy love not go unrequited shews thy rejection&#39;s roots.</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaaaaahhhh AaAa, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA—</p><p><strong>Ziusu-dra:</strong><br> Of rank, nor station, nor the title Grand have I need. Bear witness, goddess of life, to the testament writ with mine own blade.</p><p><strong>H：First Hassan:</strong><br> Thou fallen god, to beasthood turned, if Primordial Mother be thy title, attend, and hear my name.</p><p><strong>H：First Hassan:</strong><br> From the mountain abyss, I come, and only death do I bring. I am the Old Man of the Mountain, the First Hassan-i Sabbah.</p><p><strong>H：First Hassan:</strong><br> The bell of evening tolls thy name. Touch not the sky, for by heaven&#39;s will I shall strip thee of thy wings!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Beast II&#39;s Spirit Origin pattern has changed...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t believe it...Not only were Tiamat&#39;s wings severed, but now she&#39;s had the concept of “death” forced onto her!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Tiamat is as enormous as ever, but now she has a normal Servant&#39;s Spirit Origin pattern!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can beat her! If you act now, you can completely destroy Beast II!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Romani! I&#39;ve identified her Spirit Origin Core!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It&#39;s clichéd, but it&#39;s in the head! Tiamat&#39;s Spirit Origin Core, her weakness, isn&#39;t in the heart, but the head!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nice one, Leonardo! Fujimaru, you heard that, right!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Target Beast II&#39;s head! This is the true final battle!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yes. And just as we should expect of Beast II, the instant she recognized her own mortality, she marshaled all her might!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She&#39;s birthing even more Laḫmu while she flees for the boundary of the underworld!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> She&#39;s scrambling up the wall to escape to the surface!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> She&#39;s not going anywhere!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, no she doesn&#39;t!</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s the spirit! This is truly our last chance!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Mash, Fujimaru, we can get reacquainted later! The storm is coming! Are you prepared to face it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Of course, Merlin, Mage of Flowers!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And Senpai, this must be the final battle of the Seventh Singularity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know I was weak before, but please give me your orders, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is for all our friends who believed in us—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll do whatever&#39;s necessary to defeat that Beast!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s do it, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Incredible...! All of these flowers in my underworld!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> Wait, that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on. I just regained control over the underworld!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> All right, this is a one-time deal. I give you all permission to act in the underworld and give you a power boost, too!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> The mistress of Kur, Ereshkigal, asks you a favor! Heroes of the surface, crush that evil dragon!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> The connection between Earth and the heavens must be severed by human hands— By humanity, continuing far into the future!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve beaten back the mutant Laḫmu defending her! We&#39;ll head for Tiamat—</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I mean, Beast II&#39;s head!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ereshkigal&#39;s blessing even lets me walk on air? No. Wait. Mash and Fujimaru, too?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I see. How sad. But I suppose if that&#39;s what she chose, there&#39;s nothing for it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Bel Laḫmu approaching! They&#39;re fast! It&#39;s a new type that specializes in flight!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> On top of that...their magical energy level surpasses even a Demon God! Think of them as Beast II&#39;s direct familiars!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hmph, we can&#39;t be intimidated by enemies of that level any more. Just bring it o—</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> No, don&#39;t bring it, don&#39;t bring it! They really are tough!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Jaguar Warrior has dropped out! No, she fell! More incoming, a total of 11!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So they are the true offspring of Beast II!</p><p><strong>First Hassan:</strong><br> This proves a worthy battle. A single horn cannot slake my sword&#39;s thirst, and disuse ends only in disrepair.</p><p><strong>First Hassan:</strong><br> Child of Chaldea, wouldst thou welcome an Assassin&#39;s aid?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mr. King Hassan!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, hell yes!</p><hr><p><strong>First Hassan:</strong><br> Very well. Henceforth, my sword shall create your destiny, and your will shall create my body.</p><p><strong>First Hassan:</strong><br> The last vestiges of my title, shed with thy wings. Thou shalt not find me the weaker for it.</p><p><strong>First Hassan:</strong><br> Contractor, employ Azrael as thou wilt. Now, and for ever more if it should be thy wish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...! There is no more dependable reinforcement than you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Commencing battle! Let&#39;s break through the mutant Laḫmu and reach Beast II&#39;s head!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ve finally caught up to the head, but Beast II is only three hundred meters from the surface!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hurry! At the rate she&#39;s going, she&#39;ll only need a few more minutes to climb out! Destroy her core, no matter what!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood...! Master, your orders, please! Beast II cleanup operation begins now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Beast II is still standing! Dammit. Her Spirit Origin&#39;s durability is astounding!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Your attacks are still effective, though! Almost, you&#39;re almost there!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ugh, trying to swallow me whole!? Rude! I&#39;m not Marduk, there&#39;s no way I&#39;d survive that!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Cath Palug, do me a favor! Can you go ahead and teleport me!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fooou, fou? (Special translation: What the hell are you talking about? )</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ghaaaaaaaa! How dare you, Cath Paluuug!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What, is Merlin out!? You can&#39;t neutralize the Chaos Tide without him!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Damn! She went to target the support first! We won&#39;t be able to fight for long without him!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Keep your distance! If you two get consumed by the Chaos Tide, that&#39;ll be the end of everything!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But we can&#39;t just back down now...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t care if we end up getting consumed...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In that case, I&#39;ll be a shield for Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Getting swallowed by the mud would change Senpai into a different creature, but I won&#39;t let that happen!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As a Demi-Servant, I should be able to withstand it for a while!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! If Master is determined to stay, I stay, too!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash...! But your body can barely—</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> What are you talking about? If a long battle is not possible, you just need to end it swiftly.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Or are you worried about your firepower? I suppose you fools leave me no choice. I will help you out.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you are—</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Servant, Archer. Gilgamesh, King of Heroes. You mongrels were making such a racket, I had to come see what was happening.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well, I came all the way here. What&#39;s a little rule-breaking for a king?</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The golden...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The King...!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh! You&#39;re safe!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Hah. Something like that. This is the underworld, after all. There&#39;s still room for compromise.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> And listen, Tiamat. Looks like an understanding of death has helped you finally revert to a form of Divinity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Know that I don&#39;t hate you. The people of Uruk may harbor anger, but they don&#39;t hate you, either.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> But we are fated never to understand each other.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You give birth and nurture. We grow up and leave.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> No matter how much love children receive, they must eventually leave their mother&#39;s embrace.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Here and now, I will demonstrate that truth! Don&#39;t worry, I have no intention of dishonoring your corpse.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> We no longer need your foundation of the world! You can rest in the land of death once and for all!</p><p><strong>Tiamat:</strong><br> AaAAAAAAAAAAHHH LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well. Neither of us have much time. Let&#39;s put an end to this, Fujimaru of Chaldea!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I shall grant you the honor of fighting alongside me at this final hour! Now show me the worth of your tale as a deity slayer!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve detached Beast II from the wall! She&#39;s falling to the bottom of the underworld!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Spirit Origin collapse confirmed. Eleven Magical Reactor Cores have gone critical!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Everyone hurry and take refuge above in Uruk! Beast II is going to explode!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fooooou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, give me your hand...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash...!</p><hr><h2 id="section-22-return-to-chaldea" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-22-return-to-chaldea" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 22: Return to Chaldea</h2><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are we...alive?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, we were lucky the battle in the underworld was aerial. We&#39;ve returned to Uruk, Master!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yes, good work, you two. I&#39;ve confirmed the complete collapse of Beast II&#39;s Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;ve won. Now that Tiamat has been destroyed, the Singularity&#39;s cause is vanishing.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Now things should slowly return to normal in Mesopotamia, to the original history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. And when I opened my eyes in Uruk, the Holy Grail was in my hands, Senpai. We managed to retrieve it!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ouch...Don&#39;t put yourself out thanking me for that or anything.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> When I was hurrying back to the battlefield, Tiamat came falling down.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The Holy Grail spilled right out of her throat, so I caught it and came back up here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Thank you again, Merlin.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No worries. Everything&#39;s worth all the hard work if I was of some use. After all, I didn&#39;t make much of an appearance towards the end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Huh, I never figured you for the physical type.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course I am. Did you know that I was Altria&#39;s instructor in swordsmanship?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Besides, I&#39;m bad with magecraft. I say incantations too fast and get my tongue tied. It&#39;s just easier to beat people down with a sacred sword instead.</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Why, hello there. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re doing well, Merlin.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Do you remember? I promised you payback, yes!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> No way! It&#39;s Quetzalcoatl!?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> I&#39;m not letting you get away, no! I&#39;m going to muuurder you, yesss!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ahhhhhhhh?! What the hell, it hurts! Why does it hurt!? I&#39;m an incubus, but it really hurts!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I know every pain, chill, and itch one can feel, but this is...Quetzalcoatl, what IS this?!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> The essence of Lucha, a joint lock! You call this a Cobra Twist in other places, yes!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Owwwww! What kind of horrible monster are you!? And why are you still around?!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t you pull some big self-sacrifice thing to kill Tiamat, to zero effect?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> That&#39;s because I saved her!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> You see, there was this space debris streaking through the stratosphere, like a falling star! So I said, “Oh, that&#39;s Kuku,” ok?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> So I&#39;m like, “Arrrrrrgh—”! And I ran above the mud, and caught her at the last second like a BOSS!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> She was so hot and fiery, my fur was burning. And thanks to the slippery mud, we were on a non-stop slip-and-slide course to the port.</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I managed to make it to the forest, meow, and buried Kuku in the ground, and just when I got back to Uruk...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I saw that big hole and I was like, “Better go help Fujimaru,” so I jumped down to fight, but I felt more dead than alive in there, meow!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good job, Jaguar!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Those words are paw-sitively enough for me! All right, I&#39;m pumped up now! I&#39;m going to Chaldea, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So...You really were a goddess?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;ve been telling you from the beginning! I&#39;m of a lower class, but I do have Divinity!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just have to prove it to you next time...Chaldea, huh? I bet the food is purr-fectly delicious...</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> I&#39;ll bet that you have my favorite Japanese food in the cafeteria...I&#39;m a lower-grade deity so I can just slip in alongside you...</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Whew. I think that&#39;s enough punishment! After all, Merlin&#39;s knavish ways are what helped us out!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> If you think so, then could you at least hold back a little bit? I&#39;m too young for a back injury!</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Hm? What&#39;s up with the sparkles? I feel so purrty, but I&#39;m disappearing from my feet up?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Am I finally gaining another star as a Divine Spirit?</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Of course not. You&#39;re just leaving, Jaguar. It&#39;s the Earth&#39;s way of saying that our job here is done.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> It was an unnatural summoning to begin with. A Divine Summon, only possible because the Mother Goddess Tiamat was here.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> If she vanishes, we will too. You knew that, right?</p><p><strong>Jaguar Warrior:</strong><br> Seriously!? I didn&#39;t even get a single heart!</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> ...Sorry. That&#39;s how it is, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> We&#39;ve helped you as far as we can, but your real fight is just beginning...</p><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> You can do it, my cute little Master. I&#39;m expecting you to put on one splendid victory to rouse the audience, yes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Thank you for everything!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Gracias, amiga! Luchadora!</p><hr><p><strong>Quetzalcoatl:</strong><br> Of course! Big sister loves a farewell like this, yes!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> She was quite the boisterous goddess till the end. Though I guess I shouldn&#39;t be talking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar! You&#39;re safe!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re fading away. Are you going to stay in this era?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yes. The Holy Grail didn&#39;t call me forth. The Singularity is gone and we&#39;ve prevented the Incineration of Humanity—</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Just like he said, I&#39;ll stay here in this world until the first Uruk dynasty ends.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And besides, I did receive twenty percent of the gems in Babylon&#39;s treasury. It&#39;d be a waste not to enjoy them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yep. So I won&#39;t be going to your place until I&#39;m done with that.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Make sure you save up until I get there. I&#39;m a very expensive goddess, you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What about Ereshkigal...?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ereshkigal! What did you just do!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The goddess of the underworld, helping the living for free! And not just any living creature, a human!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you know the repercussions of a goddess breaking two such taboos!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> So what?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I&#39;m the mistress of the underworld. I simply used the method most likely to succeed in protecting it.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What&#39;s with that smug look? Your knees are shaking! It&#39;s not too late. Remove the Blessing of Kur!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You finally found someone you can talk to, right!? What good will it be if you disappear now!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Even if you do get another chance, it won&#39;t be the same you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You might not have the same personality you have now. You won&#39;t meet people like you did this time!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...Y-you think so? Maybe I&#39;ll meet someone next time in an even more dramatic fashion.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> No, you won&#39;t! Just how much of a naïve maiden can you be!?</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I won&#39;t, huh...I guess. My original Divinity and personality are a bit darker than I am right now.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to hold a proper conversation...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You won&#39;t be summoned in the first place! If it&#39;s not the current you, none of your connections or memories will remain!</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...I see. Yeah, you&#39;re right.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> But I&#39;m okay with that. It&#39;s not like I like the current “me” or anything.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> ...I just liked that human&#39;s way of thinking. As long as [♂ he /♀ she] doesn&#39;t change, that&#39;s good enough for me.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> And as long as [♂ he /♀ she] remembers me, I know we&#39;ll see each other again.</p><p><strong>Ereshkigal:</strong><br> I know that, so that&#39;s why I can give up everything here.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ereshkigal is resting in the underworld. She told me to give her thanks to you all.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...Fou, fo!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Anyway, about Goldie over there.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> What are you doing? What was up with your getup earlier?</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I was on the verge of death. I just got a little reckless.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> That was me when I went to the underworld and fell into the Abyss seeking the mystic herb. My golden age.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have a body anymore. So I gave you a peek of what that looked like while Ereshkigal wasn&#39;t looking.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> You came all the way to Uruk, so it wouldn&#39;t have been fair if you didn&#39;t get to see the King of Heroes&#39; true form.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...You don&#39;t have a body...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Are you a ghost!?</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Something like that. Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;ve finished my farewells.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Return to Chaldea, sing the song of your victory, and praise my name for all to hear.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> ...Hold on a second. I forgot to ask something.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> How was Uruk? You&#39;ve been here for a while.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It was fun!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Best. City. Ever.</p><hr><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> I see. One more thing, as a matter of kingly dignity.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> If travelers are able to leave with a smile, then a good country should send them off with a souvenir.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Oh, now that I mention it, I do have a little something.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> A specialty of Uruk, some wheat ale. Take it with you.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> W-wait a second! Th-that container! That container!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you very much, King Gilgamesh. But...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master and I are still underage, and can&#39;t drink. Our apologies.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> Well, if you can&#39;t drink it, at least take the cup. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be useful for something.</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> In any event, farewell, warriors of Chaldea! Our battle was a truly gratifying victory!</p><p><strong>Gilgamesh:</strong><br> With your return, I declare operations at the Demonic Front concluded! Do not fail to prevent the Incineration of Humanity!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King Gilgamesh...Yes. Senpai will pull it off.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...It seems we&#39;re being forced out as well. Doctor, no problems there, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yep, we&#39;re ready to receive you. For once, we can take our time with the Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, why don&#39;t you say something, Merlin? You&#39;re going to head back to your tower in Avalon, right?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh, if you&#39;re worrying about me, then I guess it really is time to bid my farewell.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Well, since I can&#39;t die, I&#39;m not going anywhere. I&#39;ll be watching over your fight.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I wasn&#39;t supposed to be helping you out like this. I want you to think of this as a special case.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...But you did help us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Then why did you help us?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it obvious? I&#39;m a big fan.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Foooou!?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I&#39;m a man that can only watch.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I may not much like individual humans, but I love the stories you weave.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I get excited by the stories I read, but I&#39;m not interested in the humans who wrote them.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> But...You&#39;re a bit different. You&#39;re a traveler who journeys between books, just like me.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Yet, instead of just being a passive observer, you use those stories to save everyone and weave together a better ending.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> And so your actions are something that only I can truly appreciate.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Once this Grand Order is finished, the only one who&#39;s going to remember every little thing is me.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Yep. That&#39;s why, just once, I wanted to help you.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> This time a Beast made her appearance, so Mr. King Hassan and I had everything we needed to participate.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I got a little over-excited and left my tower like this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Merlin.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you...It was fun!</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Ha, funny...Maybe I&#39;ve become a tad more human. Hearing that from you before, I wouldn&#39;t have felt anything...</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> In any event, I&#39;ll be taking my leave, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Chaldean stargazer, a pioneer that no one will remember. I honor your battle.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> The stars are in full circle. You will fight the evil at the end of the era of humanity.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Have a good journey until the end. I pray for clear skies at the end of your travels.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning. How do you feel, Senpai?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rayshift has been completed successfully. Chaldea is currently using Sheba to analyze the Holy Grail from the Seventh Singularity...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and how it was sent to Uruk in the first—</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> Red alert. Emergency. Red alert. Emergency.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> Chaldea external reactive theory units seven through three have been destroyed. Proof of non-existence, failing.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> Detecting fluctuations in strength of pseudo-Spiritrons comprising the facility. We&#39;re being drawn towards the Quantum Time Lock.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> T-minus 4368 hours until Chaldea exterior settles on 2018.</p><p><strong>Announcement:</strong><br> T-minus ■■■ hours until inner-Chaldea settles on 12/31/2018.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...! Doctor! Someone is hacking us remotely!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. Sorry this had to come right after you got back. The time has finally come, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Solomon is interfering...No, we&#39;re being drawn in, I imagine.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve analyzed the Holy Grail from the Seventh Singularity. The result—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ve found the coordinates for a Singularity that doesn&#39;t exist in human history. Confirmed, it&#39;s Solomon&#39;s–the Mage King&#39;s–Singularity!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But the reverse is true, too. The second we learned those coordinates, Solomon learned the coordinates of Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words, Chaldea is trying to merge with the Mage King&#39;s Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So we&#39;re headed straight into the enemy&#39;s lair, basically?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s correct. More annoyingly, their spatial strength is greater than ours.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If we continue to be drawn in like this, this place is going to be destroyed, like a star being sucked into a black hole.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right. We&#39;ll just have to defeat Solomon before then.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We know the coordinates of their Singularity. We can Rayshift at any time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I wanted to adequately test our plans before taking him on, but...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...It looks like that&#39;s not going to happen. We don&#39;t have any time, and neither does humanity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Solomon&#39;s goal. The band of light. What exactly is the Incineration of Humanity?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This operation will see all those questions answered.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s finally time...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...The final...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, as the acting commander of Chaldea, I am ordering everyone to prepare for our final battle.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As of today, the lives of all the staff in Chaldea are in my, Romani Archaman&#39;s, hands.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Master Fujimaru. Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I will give you one day of rest. I need you in peak physical and mental condition.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> When you two return to this control room, Chaldea&#39;s final battle will begin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We will head towards Solomon&#39;s Singularity. The Final Singularity, The Grand Temple of Time: Solomon!</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Singularity/babylonia.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
